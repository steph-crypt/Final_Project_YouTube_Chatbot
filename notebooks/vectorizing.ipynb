so um', \"okay so here's how I did that people\", 'have calculated how many moves there are', 'in a chess game maximum number um', \"there's a rule that says that you can\", 'only go 50 moves without moving a pawn', 'or capturing a capture or at that point', 'either player can declare a draw and', \"let's make sure that they do you don't\", 'want to go beyond that okay so so that', \"would mean

\"so that's the rules okay so the maximum\", 'number of moves is', '5,900 given that rule so you know you go', 'along and then 50 moves and then you', 'capture a piece and then you go on', 'another 50 moves you try to make it last', 'as long as possible see see the longest', 'trying to calculate the maximum number', 'the maximum number okay so you just you', 'just move around not capturing pieces', 'until you have to capture a piece that', 'makes the longest game and so then uh', 'you want to promote all your pawns to', 'Queens and to do that you have to have', 'four pawns capture a piece or something', 'so you get you get them lined up in rows', 'of two each the Knight Pawn captures', \"something it's in front of the Rook pawn\", 'and the black does the same thing and', 'then you can

the\", 'pawns you try to capture the pieces', 'first get some other piece some other', 'piece got it got it your Pawn gets to', 'capture his Knight okay and then you got', 'your two pawns lined up and

Exactly.', 'Will math for food. I think', \"unfortunately that is a job. It's called\", 'tutors. Really? Really? Exactly. uh and', 'your research includes I have here the', 'geometry and particle phenomenology in', \"string theory. So we just want let's\", 'just get to the bottom of this. What is', 'string theory? Yes. String theory is an', \"attempt to reconcile Einstein's theory\", 'of general relativity the theory of', 'gravity with the formalism of quantum', 'mechanics and quantum field theory. So', 'it is a consistent quantum theory of', 'gravity. um may not be the way that', 'quantum gravity works in our universe,', \"but at the very least, it's a\", 'theoretical playground where we get to', 'ask questions about quantum gravity.', \"Now, you've made an assumption in there,\", 'and I agree with this assumption, but I', 'want to hear you defend it. You you are', \"trying to absorb Einstein's general\", 'theory of relativity, our modern', 'understanding of gravity, right, into a', \"quantum description. Why aren't you\", 'trying to take the quantum and absorb it', 'into a general relativity description?', 'Because inherent in what both of you', 'said there must be an inongruency that', 'would cause you to have to do that.', \"Exactly. So why don't you start with\", 'that law? What what is the inongruency', \"here that you're trying to resolve? Two\", 'of the greatest intellectual', 'accomplishments of the 20th century in', \"my opinion are Einstein's theory of\", 'gravity and the description of', 'fundamental interactions in nature um as', 'described by particle physics. So things', 'like uh a description of you know quirks', 'fundamental particles how they interact', 'with each other that gives us a', 'description of things like', 'electromagnetism and the strong and weak', 'nuclear forces. these sort of basic', 'building blocks of matter, these', 'fundamental Legos that we can hook', \"together, they're described very well by\", 'by quantum field theory. The issue, the', 'the sort of discrepancy between these', 'two is that each separately are able to', 'make predictions that are incredibly', 'accurate in our modern world. So, we can', 'make predictions to like 13 significant', 'figures using either of these', \"theoretical frameworks. That' be 13\", 'decimal places, right? 13 significant', \"figures. Yeah, I'm going to say that's\", \"pretty accurate. It's pretty great.\", 'Yeah. and like things like modern GPS', \"wouldn't work without general\", 'relativity. So we have a lot of ways of', 'testing these theories. They seem really', \"robust and that they're telling us\", 'really important things about how the', 'world behaves. Unfortunately, if you try', 'and combine the two, so you try and', 'describe phenomena that might need both', 'tools. So for example, things where the', 'interaction of particles and very short', 'distance scales are in play, but also', \"where there's really strong gravitation.\", 'So for example, inside a black hole, um', 'that would be a regime where you need', 'both of these these theories, these', 'frameworks to agree and give you', 'concrete predictions. And unfortunately,', 'the theories break down when you try and', \"combine them. And you don't end up\", 'getting useful answers. You get very', \"manifestly wrong answers. They're called\", 'disastrous infinities. Um things that', \"just don't predict anything.\", \"Disastrous infinities. Man, you can't\", 'get more diss than that. Sounds like the', \"worst marriage ever. Yeah, it's not\", 'great. Disastrous infinities. So, so', 'what gives you the confidence that it is', 'the quantum physics understanding that', 'will absorb gravity and not gravity', \"absorbing quantum physics? It's a great\", 'question. So, I I think that it should', 'be a two-way street. So, um in order to', 'describe either phenomena, you need', 'something that can be described in both', \"frameworks. Einstein's theory is sort of\", 'intrinsically classical um meaning that', 'this picture of the curvature of space', \"and time. It's not designed for sort of\", 'the quantum mechanical uncertainties', 'that we know and observe in particle', 'physics. So in that sense we know that', \"Einstein's theory probably at a granular\", 'level if you sort of zoom in should', 'evolve into something quantum', 'mechanical. Um but exact form of that is', 'up for for exploration. Okay. Okay. So', 'that works. Now you mentioned', 'fundamental particles and you go back to', 'ancient Greece the atom was a', 'fundamental particle that was the', 'smallest thing that you could be that', 'you could be right and then we break the', \"atom oh there's other particles and so\", \"you you you listed like electron that's\", 'fundamental and you mentioned quarks', 'what gives you the confidence that we', \"can't keep dividing cutting further\", \"further yeah that's a great question I\", \"don't think I I think most theoretical\", 'physicists would not say that we are', '100% confident that we stop there. This', \"is the the zoo of particles that we've\", 'observed so far that seem to match the', 'phenomena, the forces and interactions', 'and effects that we see in nature very', 'well. But absolutely there could be', 'smaller things in play and indeed string', 'theory posits that there are. Okay. Oh,', \"really? Right. Exactly. That's this\", 'little vibrating. So the string is the', 'fundamental string is the fundamental.', 'So take us there. Take us out. Now how', 'does strings come into this? So, the', 'idea behind string theory, the, you', 'know, the the two-minute version of what', 'string theory tries to do is it says,', 'imagine that instead of describing', 'particles as little point particles that', 'move through space, imagine that instead', 'if you were able to zoom in far enough', 'that you could have an object that has', 'an extended length associated to it. And', 'the the very rough idea is that just', 'like a violin string can vibrate in', 'different ways and produce different', 'notes, these little fundamental strings', 'can vibrate into different', 'configurations. And it turns out they', 'can change their properties. Um the', 'mathematics of how you describe these', 'things moving can change their', 'properties based on how they vibrate. So', 'they can vibrate one way and be an', 'electron. They can vibrate another way', 'and be a quark. Um, and that seems like', 'a very sort of cute idea for how to', 'describe a lot of physics in a very', \"simple framework. I But if that's if\", \"that's the case, in principle, you ought\", 'to be able to to pluck the string that', 'is otherwise an electron and get a quark', 'out of it. Have you done this? No. And', \"the problem with this, so I'm gonna tell\", \"you one thing that's really cool about\", 'this framework and then also two things', 'that are not cool. One of them is is', 'very much to do with what you said. So', \"um why can't you just test or observe\", 'you know are these strings there? The', 'theory predicts that these fundamental', 'length scales of strings are so small', 'that we would need a particle', 'accelerator about the size of the solar', 'system in order to smash atoms together', 'and directly see those strings. Um which', 'unfortunately we do not have access to', 'those type of energy scales yet. Just to', 'affirm what is implicit in your', 'statement. The larger the particle', 'accelerator, the faster you can speed', 'the particles so that when they collide,', \"there's much more energy in that\", \"collision. You'll probe regimes that\", \"previous accelerators could not. That's\", 'right. Okay. And so you just scale up', 'what we got going now and you need', 'something the size of the solar system', 'to get to these energies, right? Which', \"doesn't seem very viable. No, it's not.\", \"So what's your what's plan B? Yeah,\", 'before I answer that, let me let me just', 'throw one thing out there about string', 'theory that I think is important to say.', 'So, if you ask about quantum mechanical', 'point particles and you say what kind of', 'spaces could they move through, it turns', 'out that quantum field theory or quantum', 'mechanics can be formulated in any type', 'of space. So, they can move through', 'basically any background that you', 'choose, any any, you know, configuration', 'of space and time. But if you ask the', 'same question for these uh little', 'onedimensional strings, if you say where', 'can a quantum mechanical string move, it', 'turns out that the only spaces that', \"they're allowed to move in and do their\", 'their thing of vibrating in different', 'ways and being different particles, the', 'only space they can do that in are', \"spaces that obey Einstein's equations of\", 'general relativity. That sounds good.', 'Wow. Yeah. So you actually get gravity', 'for free in this formulation of quantum', 'mechanical strings. So we we sometimes', 'say that quantum gravity is consistent', 'and also compulsory in string theory', \"because it's being you know you're\", 'forced on you by the equations that the', \"strings may satisfy. So that's a good\", 'feeling then because it means something', 'is talking to something else in the form', 'in the formulation right that that that', 'was not crowbarred in to begin with.', \"That's right. So it's sort of being\", 'handed to you and that fact is I think', 'something that early in the development', 'of string theory got a lot of people', 'excited. Unfortunately, like many good', 'things, uh things come with a catch. And', 'the catch in string theory is that this', 'beautiful formulation I just described', 'of, you know, you can describe all of', 'particle physics by one little extended', 'object. You get gravity for free only', 'seems to work if the universe that this', 'happens in has more than three spatial', 'dimensions and one timelike dimension', 'that we seem to see in our universe. So,', 'you need extra dimensions because right', 'now we live in four dimensions, which is', 'three spatial plus time. you need more', 'dimensions in order to make this thing', \"work, but we don't have access to more\", \"dimensions. So, we can't really say for\", \"sure. Well, it's I mean, it seems like a\", 'really big intellectual leap, right?', \"We're we're pretty happy with our three\", 'dimensions of space and one dimension of', 'time. So, the first pass is like could', 'this at all is this just a dealbreaker,', 'right? Is there any way that this could', \"be consistent with what we've already\", 'observed about the universe? And as you', 'were just alluding to, right, the', 'question is, you know, could such extra', 'dimensions exist? And if so, how would', \"we try and probe whether that's the\", 'case? Um the the requirement that we can', 'see right off the bat about these extra', 'dimensions is if they were to exist,', \"they can't be the same size as the rest\", 'of the dimensions that we see in our', 'universe. So if we look around, we can', 'see that, you know, we have very large', 'spatial extent for, you know, front,', 'back, side to side, up and down, and of', 'course time. But if there were these', 'other directions, they would have to be', 'really, really small compared to the', 'rest of our universe. And the analog for', 'that is if you imagine looking at an', 'extended object like a wire from really', 'far away, it just looks one-dimensional.', 'It just looks like it has a length. But', 'if you were able to get really close to', \"that wire, you'd see that it also has\", 'something like a thickness, a radial', 'direction. And so that extra direction', \"is what's called compact. Um meaning\", \"that it's very small compared to say the\", 'length of the wire. So, one thing that', 'we do know is that if this had any', 'chance of working, these extra', 'dimensions would have to be compact and', 'very small compared to the rest of our', \"universe. Okay, you're freaking me out\", \"right now because and this I mean I'm\", 'just going to say it. So, I was down in', 'Costa Rica doing Iawaska for a week. And', 'in that time I had an experience where I', 'met these beings who told me about', 'dimensions that existed', 'inside of our dimension. So they were', 'alongside of yet inside of the dimension', 'that we live in. And I can only think', 'that maybe that was a pre-supposed', 'pre-planted post-hypnotic suggestion', 'because I have actually read about', \"string theory because if it's not\", 'or or what drugs have you been taking to', 'to get your and my my follow-up question', \"is what did you do? That's right.\", 'I I hear the question. Yeah. Is it', 'possible to have a compactified time', 'dimension as well or is we only is all', 'of the models only stuck with one time', 'dimension? Oh wow. I never even', 'considered that. Yeah. Imagine two', 'dimensions of time. Wow. Holy crap. Go', 'ahead. Yes. So the problem with two time', 'dimensional theories and compact time', \"dimensions in general is that it's very\", 'hard to maintain causality in such', 'theories. So if you have a time', 'direction that can loop back on itself,', \"it's possible to have the whole go back\", 'in time and shoot your grandpa situation', 'hitting you pretty hard. So to maintain', 'consistent theories with multiple time', 'directions or or compact time', \"directions, it's not I'm not going to\", \"say it's impossible, but most people\", \"don't consider that a very viable way\", 'forward. You would have to discard', 'causality altogether in order to do', 'that. I think in general the claim would', 'be it would violate causality in such', 'theories. Um, so there may be some', 'creative ways to get around that, but', \"generically I think that's true. By the\", 'way, we have a Stephen Hawking on one of', 'our earlier episodes. You can find it in', 'our in our archives. We went to', 'University of Cambridge and and chilled', 'with him for a bit. Tell me, he proposed', 'a time travel conjecture something like', 'that. Tell us what that was and does', 'that save us from this? Is that I mean', 'there are a number of of conjectures say', 'in the the theory of gravity that say', 'that um causality is an important', 'structure. So that um in general one', 'would not expect that consistent', 'theories of gravity or indeed quantum', 'mechanics should allow such you just', \"can't get it to work. Okay. Okay. That\", \"that's fine. I mean yeah I mean listen\", 'that me that that removes many movies in', 'the repertoire where you got to go back', 'and change the past. Exactly. Like', 'Terminator the Terminator is done.', 'Forget about it. We look back on the', 'past but we look forward to many', 'futures. So the idea of being able to', 'look back and say at this particular', 'point all those many futures still exist', 'if I could get back to that point then I', 'could change it to one of these other', \"tracks you know which I mean it's a\", 'great fantasy and it makes sense to have', \"that fantasy but what you're saying is\", \"it's a stupid fantasy cuz it ain't never\", 'going to happen. Well, I would say, you', 'know, never say never in insights. You', \"got to be careful, but um certainly it's\", 'not something that I think most people', 'have a good idea how to make work in a', \"consistent way at the moment. And that's\", \"why I'm not a scientist. And just\", 'consider to say never say never. You', 'said never. You said never. You just', \"said never. You can't say never say\", \"never unless you're saying never. Hey\", \"Star Talk fans, I don't know if you know\", 'this, but the audio version of the', 'podcast actually posts a week in advance', 'of the video version. And you can get', 'that in Spotify and Apple podcast and', 'most other podcast outlets that are out', 'there. Multiple ways to ingest all that', 'is cosmic on Star Talk. Before we sort', 'of pivot to this whole thing of', \"phenomenology cuz I want to know it's a\", \"big word with a lot of syllables. I've\", 'heard it invoked before especially in', 'particle physics. But before we step', 'there, I just want to understand how', 'will you ever test string theory? And we', 'know in advance that you have naysayers', 'out there uh physicists among them who', \"are saying you're diverting time,\", 'resources, graduate students, faculty', \"positions to something that doesn't even\", 'classify as a legitimate scientific', 'theory or or hypothesis because you need', 'to be able to test it. Without the test,', 'go home. So let me hear your response to', \"that. Absolutely. I think that's a\", 'really fair question. um you know for', \"any theoretical framework where you're\", \"trying to describe things if there's a\", 'big intellectual leap right and for', 'example extra dimensions is a pretty big', 'leap um you have to justify that with a', 'payoff right you have to say what is the', \"benefit that I'm going to give you in\", 'terms of you know structure and', \"predictions and and you know what you're\", 'learning from this theory so to push', 'back on the you know how are we going to', 'test it um let me observe first that in', 'uh particle theory in general the time', 'scales between predicting structure in', 'particle theory and then being able to', 'see it an experiment over the last half', 'century have gone you know increased in', 'size considerably. So one example of', 'this is the prediction of the Higs Bzon', 'made by Peter Higs which took about 50', 'years from the prediction that this', 'particle should exist to its observation', 'at the LHC. That means the theorists are', 'just way ahead of the experimentalist.', 'You got some deadbeat experimentalists', 'there. I I would not say that at all. I', 'would say that that dialogue of theory', 'and experiment is really important. But', \"I'm just pointing out that direct\", 'experiment of you know direct', 'verification by experiment of lots of', \"things is hard. That doesn't mean that\", \"one shouldn't do it. It just means that\", 'you know you have to to be deciding what', 'time scales are relevant for that', 'question. Um for string theory I would', 'say the problem is a lot worse than it', 'was for something like the prediction of', 'the Higs boson because the energy scales', 'are so massive to directly uh observe', \"strings. So for me personally, I I'm\", 'interested in trying to decide whether', 'string theory is useful a lot faster', 'than that in the point of view of my', 'career and I remain very agnostic as to', \"whether that's the case. So you want to\", 'be alive when when I want to be alive', 'when we decide this and also you know if', 'somebody could could demonstrate to me', 'right now that string theory was for', \"sure not useful for our universe I'd\", 'choose to work on something else. So', 'what do I think is the the sort of most', 'direct way to those types of answers is', 'that in string theory many types of', 'structure and and results in physics are', 'really intercorrelated. So it turns out', 'that in something like um the the', 'particle physics description of all the', 'particles we know about so far the', 'standard model of particle physics. So', \"that's a the organization of all the\", 'particles that we know on one in one', 'chart and you say this this interacts', 'with that and this connects here and', \"it's a it's a beautiful thing actually\", \"when you step back it's a tri I mean\", \"that happened in I'm older than both\", \"y'all that happened in my lifetime in\", 'the basically the 1970s we started', 'assembling a little earlier too but the', 'full picture was coming together as we', 'found these other particles to flesh it', \"out so it's a periodic table of\", 'particles okay all right an organiz', 'organizing principle. Very good. Okay.', 'So, pick it up there. Sorry. Quick', 'anecdote from when I was a kid. I got', 'interested in physics reading books like', 'by people like Brian Green when I was,', 'you know, in my early teens. And I had a', \"little um I'd written down the standard\", 'model like on a piece of paper. I made', 'my little zoo of particles and I like', 'carried around on a piece of paper for a', 'bit as a a super, you know, nerdy young', 'young person. Girl geek in the house.', 'Love it. Girl geek alert. Yeah, totally.', 'Totally. But um but I totally agree.', \"It's it's the zoo of what what we know\", 'is there. And the point I was going to', 'make in relation to string theory is', 'that in something like the standard', \"model, there's a lot of free numbers. So\", 'for example, nothing in that theory', 'tells you what the mass of the electron', 'is or how the quarks couple to each', 'other. Those numbers are just observed', 'in our universe. Well, you said free', 'numbers, you mean not predicted,', 'correct? Not predicted by the structure', 'of the theory. Now, in contrast to that,', 'in string theory, if you found a', 'solution of string theory that produced', 'particle physics like we see in our', 'universe, none of those numbers are', \"free. They're all determined by the\", 'configuration of these extra dimensions', 'and the structure of the theory. So,', \"it's a huge array of physics that you\", 'have to get right all at once. And here', \"I've been talking about particle\", 'physics, but you also have to answer', 'questions about cosmology and the large', 'scale structure and history of the', 'universe. So, how are you going to', 'decide if string theory is wrong? I', \"think that it's most likely that we\", 'would be able to say that the structures', 'that we see in nature, we can argue that', \"we either can or can't get the right\", 'sort of regimes of numbers and effects', 'that we already know are there um much', \"more rapidly than we're going to build\", 'an accelerator to see a string. I love', \"that. Oh, that's Yeah. Yeah. So, what\", \"you're saying is you you whether or not\", 'you can test the dimensionality or or', 'the other sort of physicality of string', 'theory. If you could, if your theorist', 'can go in the back room and come out and', 'say, I I pluck this string this way,', \"it's going to give me an electron and\", \"it's going to give me this mass, right?\", \"And it's the only mass that's going to\", \"come out of this, right? Cuz that's the\", \"right number. That's the right number\", \"and the right vibration and it's going\", 'to look like an electron. That that', \"that's a Nobel Prize right there. Yeah.\", \"It's it's like it's like the way they do\", 'like modeling or weather modeling. they', 'we have a prediction and then we run the', \"model on what's already been done and if\", 'we get those numbers then we can have', 'confidence in the predictive model', \"itself. That's right. Again, so the idea\", 'is I just articulated it. This has been', 'around for like 40 years. Um this was', 'what when people were first formulating', 'string theory, everybody was excited and', 'they thought we were going to do exactly', \"what you just said. You know, you're\", \"going to go around, you're going to look\", 'at the solutions of the string theory,', 'you\\'re going to say, \"Boom, here\\'s our', \"universe. Here's all these numbers. We\", \"just predict everything. it's great.\", \"That hasn't happened and uh there's you\", 'know people are still trying to think', 'about this. So what are some of the big', 'obstacles? One of the issues is that it', 'turns out that when you ask how many', 'different configurations for these extra', 'dimensions can there be? Um initially', 'the hope was that maybe that was very', 'restrictive. Maybe there was just a', 'couple. Um the the question of how many', 'could you have? So if you said what if', 'we just had um say two extra dimensions', 'that uh obeyed the consistency equations', \"from string theory. Turns out there's a\", 'unique answer from the differential', 'equations that tell you what that shape', 'could be. If you ask is there, you know,', 'what happens if there are four extra', \"dimensions, there's a unique answer. And\", 'then if you say, what happens if there', 'were six extra dimensions, which happens', 'to be the extra dimensions that we think', 'needs to arise to give what we see in', 'nature. Turns out there are half a', 'billion configurations and counting that', 'have been found so far. So, it sounds to', 'me like what you guys are saying is we', 'have this instrument and on the', \"instrument there's a certain amount of\", 'notes that are just resonant in the', 'instrument and now we have to figure out', 'one song', 'because all those notes can make however', 'many billions of songs.', 'We got to find the one song that all', 'those notes can play. But it also sounds', \"like nature's just messing with us.\", 'It sounds so this is a one of the the', 'things that people push back on string', 'theory on is they say okay if all these', 'possible solutions of string theory', 'exist how is it ever going to be', 'predicted and you know you could just', 'have this big soup of things and some', 'people have even made that argument.', 'They call it the string landscape where', 'they say you know you could just land', \"anywhere. So so what if there's some\", 'place in the string landscape that looks', \"like our universe there's all this other\", 'junk. What is the theory actually', 'telling us then? And the argument I', 'would I would say against that is that', 'in something like quantum field theory', 'which we already talked about for the', 'standard model this zoo of all the the', 'you know quirks and lepttons that we', 'know in nature there are an infinite', 'number of quantum field theories that I', \"could write down that aren't our\", \"universe but it doesn't matter because\", 'we do know how to write down one that', 'does look like our universe. So string', 'theory is sort of a natural extension of', 'quantum field theory in some ways and it', 'has a lot of flexibility that may have', 'nothing to do with the physics that we', 'observe in our universe. But the', 'question is once you zoom in on the the', 'parts of that theory that do you learn', 'anything? So for example, do you find', 'that if you see the particles that we', 'already know that additional particles', 'must be there or additional forces or', 'can we correlate features in cosmology', 'and the large scale structure of the', 'universe like dark energy or dark matter', 'with particle physics that we know to be', \"true? I don't want to lessen the\", 'significance of how you describe that.', \"But if I understand it, you're saying on\", 'this, like you said, this landscape of', 'half a billion possible songs that it', 'could be and you want the one song', \"that's yours, it's not useful if you\", 'find it unless upon finding it, you get', \"other insights about the universe we're\", \"in. Uhhuh. Because otherwise, it's just\", \"a just so story. Right. Right. It's the\", 'universe is just that and we and we', \"explain it with just that and it doesn't\", 'take you any further down the street. Is', 'is that a fair way to characterize it?', 'Yeah. And another thing that people are', 'asking in within string theory is how', 'many possible quantum theories of', 'gravity could there be? So imagine that', \"string theory isn't how our universe\", \"works. We know it's a quantum theory of\", 'gravity, but it might be too idealized', 'to describe our universe. So in physics,', 'we talk about, you know, pretending that', 'cows are spheres in order to make the', 'math easier. Consider a spherical cow.', 'Oh, gotcha. We do that all the time.', \"Okay. Is it? Yeah. It's just easier that\", 'way. Our uh our society of physics', 'students has a spherical cow t-shirt', 'here for at Virginia Tech. Yeah. Yeah.', \"It's a thing. That's that's pretty wild.\", \"It's a thing. If you want to maximize\", 'the milk production of a cow, right?', 'Start with a spherical cow. Start with a', 'spherical cow. Yeah. Right on. Yeah. I', \"don't want that milk. I don't want I\", \"don't want milk from a spherical cow. I\", \"don't I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going\", 'goats milk from now on. Yeah. But yeah,', \"the point I'm making is that maybe\", \"string theory isn't, you know, it's just\", 'too idealized to describe how quantum', 'gravity works in our universe. But a lot', 'of theorists are questioning, okay, if', \"that's the case, we know this is a\", 'quantum theory of gravity. So if you had', 'another one, right, like the right one', \"that isn't a string theory, how could\", 'those two theories be related? And', \"there's groups of string theorists who\", 'are trying to argue and and provide', 'mathematical theorems. Um, for example,', 'someone named Kerman Bafa at Harvard has', 'created something called the coortism', \"conjecture. And what he's positing is\", 'that perhaps if you had more than one', 'quantum theory of gravity, they must be', 'connected in some way. Otherwise, you', 'would develop inconsistencies in how you', 'could describe quantum gravity quantum', 'gravitational effects. So the the', \"argument I'm making here is that even if\", \"string theory isn't the right one,\", \"whatever that might mean, maybe it's\", 'connected to the right one. So maybe we', 'still learn structure about how string', 'theory can inform what our universe', 'should look like. Is is this what not', 'exactly what you just said but the', 'comprehensive look at all of this is', 'this what gives rise to the multiverse', \"and infinite number of universes that's\", 'a a different question but an', 'interesting one that the answer is no', 'the answer is no okay', \"we'll say that for we'll say that for\", 'later on your specific specialty within', 'string theory is particle phenomenology', 'and could could you just introduce us to', \"that absolutely so that's the question\", 'of whether string theory can produce', 'solutions that look like the particle', 'physics that we see the the standard', 'model for example um and the', 'interactions of the other fundamental', \"forces that aren't gravity and so one of\", \"the things that I've worked on um at\", 'various times over my career is trying', 'to ask for the types of solutions that', 'we we see in string theory what um', 'characterizes those that would give us', 'things like we see in nature so um again', 'coming back to this concept of the', \"string landscape Um there's a famous\", 'number of like possible solutions that', 'you can get for this this string', 'landscape. A number of like 10 to the', '500 which is unimaginably large is', 'thrown around. 10 to the 500. 10 to the', \"500. That's not a number. That's not a\", \"number. It's crazy. That's not even a\", 'number. But in that counting of', 'solutions in string theory, um so this', 'is again, you know, something that', 'people say, oh, you know, 10 to the 500,', 'how are you going to learn anything? But', 'all of those 10 to the 500 that people', 'have counted historically, none of them', 'included an electron. Okay? So if you', 'know something about the universe you', \"want to model, you don't care if there's\", '10 to the 500. Yeah. None of those can', 'possibly give rise to the type of', 'physics we see. So the type of of', 'research that I do is trying to', 'correlate what shapes for these extra', 'dimensions, what properties of string', 'theory will narrow the field down to', 'things that are close to our universe.', 'Okay. So So have you gotten there yet?', \"What's what's you know what's the hold\", \"up here? We're getting better. I mean in\", 'all honesty um you know we we have not', 'delivered on that yet but we are I feel', 'like still making legitimate progress.', 'Okay. So how about this? Because uh one', 'of the great redeeming qualities of all', 'scientific discovery or the search', \"thereof is even if I don't get to the\", 'thing I am trying to find out along the', 'way I find out all this other great', 'stuff that now gives us computers and', \"digital cameras and GPS but I didn't get\", 'to what I wanted. So what what have you', 'guys contributed that has been your', 'happy accident? Well, let me say that', 'more tightly. Say it. Tighter. You', 'ready? No. No. I love that. Go ahead. I', 'loved it, but I want to say it another', 'way. All right. Go ahead. Okay. Um, in', 'your failures, how have you succeeded?', 'So I think the the answer to that is is', 'really big and string theory as a field', 'has really expanded to you know huge', 'different numbers of sub fields and', 'researchers who do really different', 'things. So there are many different', 'answers to that question I could like', 'you know percolating in the back of my', 'mind. One is um the discovery of the', 'holographic principle which says that uh', 'phenomena like gravity are very deeply', 'related to things called gauge theories', 'which again describe the interactions of', 'particles and charges. Um that these', 'things can be related uh in different', 'dimensions of spaces. So the statement', 'is that uh gravitational theories can be', 'related to gauge theories that live on', 'the quote boundary of that space. um', 'things like the holographic principle', 'are an extremely deep uh bit of', 'structure that says that you know gauge', 'theories and particle physics and', 'gravity are not as different as we', \"thought they were. That's that's a\", 'really um profound I would say', 'observation that has arisen in string', 'theory. So the simplest example that', \"I've heard of the holographic principle\", 'is the surface of the event horizon of a', 'black hole. Okay? And and correct me if', \"I'm wrong here. So you fall through the\", 'surface has a memory of everything that', 'passed through. Interesting. And so you', 'can think of the information content of', 'the surface as the full understanding of', \"anything everything that's inside that's\", \"inside because there's no loss of\", \"information because it's all retained\", 'retained there. So that inside the black', 'hole and and if we are inside a black', 'hole of our universe because we have a', 'horizon which you can analogize to an', 'event horizon then we would be the', 'holographic projections of that. So is', 'this a fair did I c did I capture that', \"correctly? Wow. Okay. Given that I've\", 'yet to heard a physicist rebut that. So', \"is it general agreement that that's\", 'probably real? I mean in an idealized', 'sense yes. um how much that you know', 'pertains uh you know what you learn from', 'that in our universe I think is still up', 'for grabs and this is again something', 'people are are thinking about very', 'actively um other analogies that I would', \"give for you know useful stuff that's\", 'come out of string theory is um', 'relationships again between things like', 'particle physics and cosmology so you', 'know the study of uh you know dark', 'energy dark matter descriptions of', 'inflation those things being related to', 'you know how particle physics uh', 'realizes those and also structure in', 'mathematics', 'Um so there are a lot of new fields of', 'mathematics that were sparked due to', 'that dialogue between u mathematicians', 'and physicists that arose through string', 'theory and these shapes of extra', \"dimensions. So that's good. So you're\", 'exciting mathematicians, right? Yes. And', 'then they reached out and wanted some of', 'you in their department, right?', 'Sometimes. Yeah. And and I think you', \"know it's a very much a mutual\", \"relationship which is why you're taking\", 'a job away from another professor', 'professor.', \"So as one example of this um there's\", 'something called the minimal model', 'program in uh geometry which tries to', 'classify basically all these um', 'higherdimensional complex shapes like', 'all of them you know can you write down', 'compact geometries in any number of', 'dimensions and characterize all their', 'properties and and come up with sort of', 'a zoo of every possible geometry. Well', 'we get this is this is your other', \"specialty algebraic geometry. That's\", 'right. Was that a spin-off of the rest', \"of these interests? Is that No, it's\", 'very much tied to it. So the question of', 'trying to produce particle physics from', \"uh string theory that's that's a\", 'particle physics question but the actual', 'computation you have to do really rests', 'on the properties of these compact extra', 'dimensions. So you have to do a ton of', 'geometry to extract the numbers that you', 'want like the mass of the electron and', \"the coupling of the quirks. So it's sort\", 'of intrinsically interdicciplinary in', 'that sense. Wow. So I want to hear more', \"about this geometry. That's I mean\", \"that's crazy. So here's something that\", 'is so simple and lowdimensional. So,', \"don't laugh at me, but I was but I want\", 'you to take this to your level. Uh, I', 'was talking with an a topologist algebra', 'or some one of these math folk and we', 'were talking about knots. Okay. Just', 'knots. All right. And you take a string', \"and tie a knot in it. And it's a knot.\", \"It's a square knot or any whatever your\", 'knot is. Whatever knot. Okay. Whatever', 'is your knot. And', \"then we That's We're in three dimensions\", 'here. So, a one-dimensional string can', 'make a knot. I said, \"What\\'s that in', 'four spatial dimensions?\" He said, \"You', \"can't tie a knot in four dimensions.\", 'You would just lift it up and it would', 'just un unravel.\" And I and I So that', 'just messed with me. And then I then I', \"thought, let's take away a dimension.\", \"Let's go to two dimensions. Okay. Okay.\", 'Two dimensions. And if you have two', 'dimensional people in a flat surface, if', 'you take a rope and just loop it on', 'itself,', 'they cannot undo that. That is an', 'unsolvable knot to them because they', \"can't pass it back over itself to come\", 'around. Right. All right. But I in three', \"dimensions just pick it up and it's\", 'gone. Right. So that was so I was just I', \"couldn't sleep that night and then I\", 'wondered myself what is going on in the', \"mind of someone who's imagining all of\", 'this in even higher dimensions than', 'that. What kind of drugs are you hiding?', \"Did you stop? Come on Lara, don't hold\", 'out on me.', 'I shared my Iawaska. Give us the real', 'dope. You never told us that Iawaska', 'highdimensionality person talk to you.', 'Well, you know what? I I have You guys', 'are the first to know to be honest', 'because it was so freaky and freaked me', 'out and I never talked about it. But', 'then when she said string theorist of', 'the future said you are our savior.', 'I was the Neo of string theory. Neo.', 'Yeah. What is the matrix Neo? So please', 'tell us. So I really like the the not', \"analogy. Let me give another one that's\", 'sort of more directly related to the', 'kind of stuff I do. So we talked about,', \"you know, Einstein's theory of gravity.\", 'You could ask imagine that the entire', 'universe was two-dimensional, right?', 'Could you have curvature that could lead', 'to like gravitational like theories in', \"two dimensions? And it turns out there's\", 'only one number that you get to to', \"specify. And it's basically, you know,\", 'if you imagine like the surface of a', \"sphere, it's whether it's, you know,\", 'positively curved or negatively curved', \"like a saddle. That's it. And so you\", \"can't have dynamical gravity in two\", 'dimensions. Likewise, you know, the form', 'gravitation takes will change as you go', 'up in dimension. So absolutely the this', 'question of you know what can you not', 'and unnot? What can you use to describe', 'how space and time might curve all of', 'that changes with different dimensions.', 'Yeah. And so you have to get your brain', \"up in that. I'm telling you right now\", \"I'm you know I need a nap\", 'just from this conversation.', 'So, so, but the the copout thing here is', 'all the higher dimensions are all', \"compacted, so I don't have to think\", \"about or worry about it. I'll never see\", 'them, right? How how impactful are the', \"compacted dimensions if you if you're\", 'trying to manifest gravity in higher', \"dimensions? Does gravity care if it's\", 'compacted or not? Does it just care', 'about the dimensionality? It does. It', \"does care if it's compact. It It cares\", 'about the compactness. It cares about', 'the shape of those extra dimensions. And', 'indeed, we believe in string theory that', 'those extra dimensions have to still', \"obey Einstein's equations. So they still\", 'have to to be consistent gravity in in', 'those extra dimensions. Suppose we lived', 'in eight dimensions and he came up with', 'general relativity in eight dimensions.', 'Who who were you to say his 3 + one', 'dimensional thing that higher dimensions', 'have to obey that? He did that in this', \"measly 3 + 1dimensional world. You can't\", \"put you can't put commandments on higher\", 'dimensions. They are superior to us in', 'every way and you know it. Yes. I I I I', 'hate to say it but higher dimensions', \"look down on us. That's\", \"I'm sorry I had that's a t-shirt right\", 'there. That is That is a good t-shirt,', 'man. So I actually torture my my', 'undergraduate students in my class on', \"Einstein's theory. Um because Einstein's\", 'theory can be actually formulated in any', 'number of dimensions very easily. So', \"there's actually nothing special about\", 'four. Um so frequently for my students', \"I'll say you know imagine that this was\", 'in six dimensions or 10 dimensions or', 'you know she said it can be formulated', \"easily but she didn't say what she meant\", 'by easily. Very relative statement', 'there.', \"But one thing that isn't easy and this\", \"is actually uh related to why it's hard\", 'again to you know really bring string', 'theory to its full fruition is that when', \"you do do Einstein's theory in higher\", 'dimensions the equations you have to', 'solve are nastier. So, humans are not', 'really good at nonlinear differential', 'equations. Um, and they are especially', 'not good when they go into high numbers', 'of variables and high numbers of', \"dimensions. So, isn't that something?\", \"Okay. So, why don't you just get a math\", \"fluid AI bot to do this? I mean, that's\", \"the whole that's the whole point of I\", \"mean, yeah, exactly. Just it's hard for\", 'you, but give it to an AI. Yeah. So, one', \"of the the things that we've had to try\", 'and do in string theory to extract some', 'of these predictions is actually solve', \"Einstein's equations for these extra\", \"compact dimensions. And we don't know\", 'any analytic solutions um for how that', 'means, you know, exact solutions you', 'could write down on a piece of paper um', \"for Einstein's theory for the six\", 'dimensions that we would need um for', 'these these string compactations.', \"They're called in science. you can solve\", 'a problem analytically with an equation', \"and say there's the answer and some you\", \"can't and you have to actually run the\", 'experiment or or increment a model and', 'see the results each time just to see', \"where it goes, right? And so that's\", 'ugly. We hate those, but we kind of', \"recognize that that's like in chaos\", 'theory, you have to sort of calculate it', \"out, right? You can't just write down\", \"the the solution. So, uh, if you're\", \"saying you can't in principle or it's\", 'just too laborious, just not known how', 'to do it yet. Um, so in general, solving', \"Einstein's equations in any number of\", 'dimensions, you know, for any system is', \"is hard because they're nonlinear. So,\", 'what that means is that the the', 'gravitational theory is actually', 'backreacting or talking to itself. So,', 'the fact that you have gravitons, you', 'know, the the quantum mechanical', 'description of gravity in the space,', 'that can create more gravity. So this is', 'really wild in terms of the differential', 'equations because normally you could say', 'I find one solution to the theory and I', 'find another and I can just add them', 'together and still get a solution. But', \"in general relativity that doesn't work.\", \"You can't add two solutions and get\", 'another solution. You have to start over', 'every time. So so when we when we model', 'we do this in astrophysics all the time.', \"There's stuff that's just too\", 'complicated. But I know at any instant', \"what's supposed to happen and then I\", 'just load load that up. But you what', \"you're doing is you're calculating with\", 'these differential equations. These are', 'equations that you can calculate at', \"every time step and it's following you\", 'on the time step. Right. All right. But', \"you can't just solve out the whole the\", 'whole shebang. So got So all right. So', \"you But so tell me again why you can't\", 'use AI. You So we can actually and', \"that's that's a a fun topic. So um I was\", 'involved for a number of years with', \"numeric simulations like you're\", 'describing where you use a computer to', 'try and solve the equations that you you', \"can't otherwise. And historically in\", 'order to do those computations we had to', 'put them on supercomputer clusters and', 'like wait for months to get results. Um', 'but now actually um with the advent of', 'AI this is something that my', 'collaborators and I have worked on and', 'now you just do it on your iPhone right', 'now we can actually do it on a laptop.', \"Um, so we've started using machine\", 'learning algorithms to numerically solve', 'some of these differential equations. So', 'this is different than using like, you', 'know, looking at photos on the internet', 'and then having AI generate a new photo.', \"We don't have these solutions. So there\", \"isn't a database that you can train an\", 'AI model on, but you can still use the', 'framework of these neural networks to', 'try and solve really complicated', \"equations. And indeed, um, I've worked\", 'on that and and lots of other people in', 'the field have. And we found that using', 'these techniques, we can speed up a lot', 'of computations in a really substantive', 'way. And this actually made it possible', 'just recently for groups to compute', 'quark masses in string theory for the', 'first time. So to be clear, these are', 'not the quark mass values that we', 'actually observe in nature. Um that', \"would be awesome, but we don't see that\", 'yet. But we can say if you just hand me', 'some extra dimensions, whatever they may', 'be, and then say what would the you know', 'the quirks look like in that universe,', 'now we can actually come up with those', 'numbers using machine learning', 'algorithms. Chuck will go back on his', 'Iawaska trip and get the person from', 'that dimension to verify the quark quark', 'mass. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.', 'And Chuck will be the oracle of physics.', \"And I'm I'm up for it. I'm telling you\", \"right now. I'm I'm ready. I'm ready to\", \"go do more Iaska. So I'm I'm ready.\", 'So let me ask another thing. You talk', 'about what discoveries can come out of', 'this. Is it possible because this', \"excites us all. We don't say it every\", 'day, but we feel it. Could any of this', 'could any of this bring forth new', 'physics? Because up till now, everything', \"you've said has been within the\", 'framework of the quantum quantum field', 'theory, general relativity. And imagine', 'before Einstein was born, you would not', 'even know that relativity was a thing', 'you could use to solve your problems.', 'So, is there some new physics waiting to', 'emerge either either out of your work or', 'some yettobe born genius that will', 'you\\'ll look at and say, \"Oh my gosh, I\\'m', 'going to give a fast astro case here.\"', 'Okay. Uh at turn of the century, uh the', 'orbit of of Mercury around the sun', \"wasn't quite following Newton's laws,\", \"you know. It was like, well, there's\", 'probably another planet there tugging on', 'it. Yeah. We even named the planet. I', \"mean, that's how Oh, really? Yeah. We\", 'called it Vulcan. Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah.', 'Go 1910. Just look up planet Vulcan.', 'Like there it is. Okay. And so and we', 'were happy. Well, how come no one saw', \"it? Oh, cuz it's too close to the sun.\", \"It's in the glare. So we we had we had\", 'it was all there. It was all worked out.', 'All worked out. And then Einstein comes', \"up with general relativity. He wasn't\", 'trying to explain it, but he showed that', \"at very strong gravity, Newton's laws\", 'fail. You plug into his equations and', \"there's no disagreement with the thing.\", 'So Vulcan died overnight. But the new', 'physics', 'transformed the physics we were already', 'working with and gave us better answers', 'than to move on with. So what I learned', 'from that is Einstein killed Vulcan,', 'Tyson killed Pluto. Stop.', \"That's not the lesson I was trying. It's\", \"a good lesson. No, it's not. No. So new\", 'physics could take a lot of different', 'forms. Um so you know one example might', 'be perhaps there are more than the four', \"fundamental forces that we've already\", 'observed in nature. So could there be', 'you know a so-called fifth force uh', 'another version of something like', 'electromagnetism or um you know the', 'strong weak nuclear force. Um that would', 'be an example of new physics. Uh other', \"things that we know we don't understand\", 'very well include things like dark', 'energy and dark matter. um questions', 'like you know general relativity tells', 'us that there are these disastrous', 'infinities you know in the center of', \"black holes there's singularities so\", 'what actually repairs those', 'singularities in a quantum uh you know', 'gravitational theory what what tells us', 'how physics really behaves inside there', \"um that's definitely new physics and\", 'that would be the hope of the kind of', \"thing you you'd like to see oh wow to so\", \"so okay so you think there's new physics\", 'out there not again the claims on you', \"know what can string theory deliver I'm\", \"I'm still somewhat agnostic on that. Um\", \"but I think it's really interesting to\", 'try and push the theory to find out say', 'you know can you show that this just', \"can't be used to model our universe\", \"which is a real possibility and it's\", \"going to break somewhere you can't get\", 'there or can you you push it to try and', 'make some of this structure visible. So', \"I just I'd love 100 years from now look\", 'back on this conversation and say look', 'at those idiots back in 2025. Yeah. This', 'will be a kindergarten video 100 years', 'from now. I hope so.', 'So, I got something else here about a', \"duality in string theory. What's going\", 'on there? Yeah, this is something that I', 'and my collaborators are working on at', \"the moment. That's a cool word, by the\", 'way, duality. I love duality. Duality.', 'So, the idea behind duality is that you', 'could have two different theories or two', 'different geometries as they arise for', 'these compact extra dimensions in string', 'theory that secretly are different sides', 'of the same coin. So an analogy that I', 'give sometimes in talks is if you ever', 'looked at some of these optical', 'illusions photos on the internet where', \"you know you have a picture that's\", 'either a vase if you look at it one way', 'or two faces if you look at it the other', 'way you can say you know is it a vase or', \"is it faces and the answer is it's both\", \"right it's both packaged the question in\", 'string theory is you have all these', 'different you know half a billion', 'configurations for extra dimensions do', 'they all lead to different physics and', 'the answer that we think is no um there', 'are known equivalences of different', 'so-called topological spaces. These are', 'things that have, you know, a different', 'geometric properties like their number', 'of holes and their structure. Um, those', 'different topological spaces can', 'actually lead to the same physics that', \"we would see. So that if there's\", 'redundancy in that that is really', \"powerful because it means you don't have\", 'to search through half a billion', 'possibilities. You can, you know, maybe', 'sort of fold those possibilities in half', 'and only look at some portion of them.', 'Um, some of these dualities have been', 'around for, you know, 20 years in string', 'theory. and my collaborators and I think', 'we have new examples uh which require uh', 'less um super symmetry. So a less', 'spherical cow than people had assumed in', \"the past. Okay. Yeah. We're growing some\", 'legs in the cow for example. Um and we', 'think that this may improve our ability', 'to calculate lots of things and also', 'teach us some new properties', 'mathematically about how these spaces', 'can behave. Wait, catch us up on super', 'symmetry. So super symmetry is something', 'that comes along for the ride um for', 'some formulations of string theory which', 'says that all the quirks and lepttons', 'that we see in nature may have', 'additional partners um so for example', 'instead of uh you know a quark you have', 'a squirk a another partner um that would', 'be much heavier than the existing', \"particles that we've seen. So when\", \"you're describing super symmetry, it's a\", 'symmetry beyond the symmetries that are', 'already known and loved in the standard', \"model. That's right. So all these these\", 'sort of three generations of of quirks', \"and lepttons that we've seen already um\", 'there would be another whole set of', 'those particles that would share many of', 'their properties but be heavier in mass', 'and sort of the opposites and that each', 'theory, you know, each particle that was', 'say a bzon would have a firmionic', 'partner and so on. All right. So, so', \"what you're saying is\", \"you're not content with just these three\", 'regimes we have in the standard model.', 'Just hand us somewhere in the universe', 'other regimes above that and see what', 'properties they might have and that', \"could explain stuff that we don't now\", \"understand. That's an idea. And people\", 'initially thought this idea might', 'explain some really um important', 'questions in particle physics. uh for', 'example to do with the mass of the Higs', \"Bzon that would be what's called\", 'low-cale super symmetry and particle', 'experiments like the LHC search very', \"hard for this and didn't see it. So some\", 'people consider super symmetry not a', 'very useful idea because they thought', 'you know it might appear in these', 'regimes and it would not be useful. Um', 'people are reinvestigating this question', 'in string theory. You know some of the', 'solutions of string theory are super', 'symmetric some are not. Um what we', 'generally would agree on is that if you', 'did have super symmetry it would have to', 'be at a very high scale. So it would be', 'much um these particles would be much', 'heavier than you could see in an', 'experiment like the LHC and that the', 'symmetry would be spontaneously broken', 'in universes like ours. So that by the', 'time you got down to, you know, where we', 'live now, you would only see the', 'standard model particles at the energy', 'and not the other ones that would have', 'helped birth it. So So', \"um I'm going to say that's rather\", 'convenient though.', \"I'm just going to say\", 'so the question is like why do you need', \"that symmetry right if if you're kind of\", 'getting rid of it back when you know you', 'really want to be talking about the', 'physics yeah conveniently discarding it', \"that's a great great question um in some\", 'string theories it still plays a role in', 'terms of regulating the quantum', 'mechanical behavior of the theory and', 'making it well behaved so in that sense', \"you know you're still using it\", 'theoretically for something even though', \"you don't need it to describe the\", 'particle physics that we are observing', 'in nature. But I think all string', \"theorists would ask, it's a really\", 'interesting question to say how much of', 'the super symmetry can you get rid of', 'and then still preserve the features', 'that are of interest to us. So the types', 'of dualities I was describing, these are', 'are perhaps um new because they involve', 'less reliance on super symmetry than we', \"had in the past. And so we're still\", 'observing this sort of redundancy or', 'these different descriptions of the same', 'physics packaged different ways. Um, but', \"we don't need as much super symmetry. If\", 'if memory serves, the graviton is not in', 'the standard model. Is that correct?', \"That's right. So that means no one is\", 'thinking about a super symmetric', 'particle to the graviton because that', 'would be kind of interesting. Yeah, you', 'you certainly could for any particle um', 'you know any gauge bzon, you could have', \"a what's called a gino. So a a super\", \"symmetric particle. Gauge eno. They're\", 'just making pulling it out of the ass.', \"Yes. It's sounds like you're naming like\", 'pharmaceutical products. This is before', 'my era in physics, but I do feel that', 'some of these names are very much a', 'product of the 1970s. I was in high', \"school. That's how old I am in the\", \"1970s. And I'm just, you know, there was\", 'like the particle of the month club.', 'What new particle was being discovered', 'in the new accelerators in California', 'and elsewhere. Uh, and we were just', 'building this fabric of the universe out', \"of that. That's kind of cool actually.\", 'Fun to be witness to it. It was fun.', \"That's fun. Yeah. Not participant, but\", 'witness. Could you expend a moment just', 'celebrating the idea of symmetry in', 'physics? Yeah, this is a really really', 'great question. So, symmetry in physics', 'um this is something that is extremely', 'deep and has been very very predictive', 'and powerful over the last hundred years', 'of physics. So this is a question that', 'in my classes to undergraduates I try', 'and convey that a lot of physics is', 'based on looking at a phenomena that you', 'see like an apple falling from a tree', 'and saying you know how do I model the', \"the path that that's going to fall right\", 'like how do I write an equation that', 'describes that but once you start', 'talking about symmetries and these are', 'uh basically rules for how you might', 'change a space or an equation in ways', 'that can leave it alone. Once you start', 'talking about symmetries, you actually', 'have the power to ask, could the theory', \"that I'm describing be any different? It\", 'allows you to ask questions about not', 'just what you observe, but whether any', 'theory that you write down could have uh', \"arisen differently in nature. So there's\", 'some um kind of highulutin quote by', 'Einstein that you know saying he wanted', \"to to probe God's thoughts um you know\", 'in terms of his theories which sounds', 'extremely grandiose but the the tangible', 'non theological um underpinning of that', 'is that you can ask for a theory if I', \"write down this theory like Einstein's\", 'theory of relativity could it have been', 'different what is the freedom to uh', 'change that theory at all could there', 'have been any other theory of gravity', 'that could have worked what does it what', 'what does it have to do with the our', 'understanding understanding of what the', 'word symmetry means. Right? So the idea', 'behind symmetries is that if I tell you', 'about the rules for what I can do for a', 'theory and leave it alone, that is', 'equivalent to specifying the theory. So', 'for example, um if you want to ask how', 'do the laws how are the laws of physics', 'impacted by the fact that if I do an', 'experiment here and then I move that', 'experiment 5t to the left and do the', 'same experiment, I should get the same', 'answer. Right? What is that the', 'implication of that for the laws of', 'physics? It turns out that that', 'phenomena that you know the laws of', \"physics shouldn't care whether your\", 'laboratory is here versus 5t to the', \"left. That's very much linked to\", 'something like the conservation of', 'momentum in classical physics or the', 'fact that you should do an experiment', 'today and get the same answer tomorrow', 'is related to the idea that energy is', 'conserved in classical physics. So all', 'of these um sort of can I shift', 'something you know in some concrete way.', 'There I talked about, you know, moving', 'an experiment or doing the same', 'experiment at different points in time.', 'But, uh, in more general, you can say if', 'I could characterize all the different', 'ways that I can, you know, pick', 'something up, turn it over, look at it,', 'you know, shift its description, and if', 'it stays the same, that actually tells', 'me what equations are compatible with', \"that in a really predictive way. I've\", 'got another symmetry here, mirror', 'symmetry. So, what do you have for us', 'there? M so mirror symmetry was uh', 'originally discovered um in the context', 'of these string compactifications. So', 'considering solutions of string theory', 'that could lead to you know physics like', 'we we see in our universe. The compact', 'extra dimensions that people were trying', 'to write down they discovered that all', 'the solutions they could find seem to', 'come in pairs and these pairs involved', 'interchanging topological numbers. So a', 'topological number is all the ways that', 'you can change a geometry or sorry is', 'characterized by all the ways you can', 'change a geometry um without', 'intrinsically changing what it is. So', 'the classic example is that you can', 'change a donut into a coffee cup. So you', 'you picture you know taking yourself a', 'donut and if you imagine the material', 'was all rubbery and you could stretch it', 'and squish it any way you want but not', 'cut it. How can you deform that shape or', 'change it or put another hole in it? And', 'and this is a coffee cup with a a little', 'finger hole with a handle. Yeah. Yeah.', \"With It wouldn't work if it didn't have\", 'a handle. Right. Right. So it was just', \"like a drinking glass. Doesn't work.\", 'Yeah. Not the coffee cup from Starbucks', \"because that doesn't have a handle.\", 'Right. Okay. Okay. The the idea there is', 'that a geometry with a single hole. You', \"can't change the number of holes.\", \"Whether that's the center of the doughut\", 'or if you could smoosh it around and', 'turn it into the handle of a coffee cup.', \"Um that's what's called a topological\", 'invariant. But the number of holes is', 'one of these examples of of topological', 'numbers. So a a donut has one hole. You', 'could imagine, you know, a donut that', 'was built to have two holes and so on.', 'You know, this this kind of thing', 'describes or characterizes geometry. So', 'in mirror symmetry, all these geometries', 'come with topological numbers. But any', 'combinations you could have, it turns', 'out you could have in more than one', 'configuration. And this again sort of', 'divides the space of possible geometries', 'in half in this case. Uh it tells you', 'that all of them are are you know', 'interchangeable in concrete ways.', 'Wow.', 'Man, that is insane.', 'First of all,', 'why? Why?', \"It's a really great question. That's so\", 'crazy. I love it though. Well, but I got', \"more here. Well, we just we're just\", \"we're just cracking this egg. You know\", 'what? Do I have a kabi yao manifolds? So', 'these are examples of configurations for', 'the shapes of extra dimensions in the', \"string theory that satisfy Einstein's\", 'equations. Um so these are the the half', 'a billion possibilities that I was', \"talking about. Manifold I didn't get the\", \"word manifold. Yeah, y'all got that from\", 'Star Trek. Get out of here.', 'Named after two very clever', 'mathematicians. Um yeah, these manifolds', 'were conjectured to exist by a', 'mathematician named Eugene Kabi and', 'proved by uh Yao who won a Fields Medal', 'for his proof that um these these things', \"solve Einstein's equations. Do you know\", \"about the Fields Medal? No, I don't. So,\", \"it's kind of like the Nobel Prize in\", \"mathematics. Um it's given to major, you\", 'know, substantive discoveries in', 'mathematics. Um but the catch is you got', 'to be under 40 to to get it. So, um you', 'have to be young and clever. Oh, man. Of', 'course, the mathematicians would use', 'chronology as a determining fact. Yeah.', \"Discriminating. It's agist. I think it\", 'is. Yeah. Exactly. Homological', 'field mirror symmetry. So, this is um an', 'example of something where there was a', 'dialogue between string theory and', 'mathematics that was really fruitful. So', 'these observations about clabia', 'manifolds and their topology were first', 'observed in string theory and', 'mathematicians went away and tried to', 'sort of explain why that was happening', 'and found a correspondence between a lot', 'of deeper mathematical structures that', 'actually led to another fields metal for', \"a gentleman named Kvich. That's Maxim\", 'Kvich. Maxim that sounds Russian', 'exactly. So this type of of structure', 'you know this dialogue between maths and', 'physics I personally think is really', \"fruitful. We've learned a lot from\", 'mathematicians um from building these', 'kinds of things. And then the the fun', \"question that I'm asking recently is,\", 'you know, could there be new variants of', 'this that could lead to new physics, new', 'predictions for particle physics, but', 'also new mathematical structures. So', \"some of the dualities we're looking at\", 'right now involve not just changing two', 'manifolds or or two configurations of', 'geometry, but actually mixing things', 'like electromagnetic fields in those', \"backgrounds with geometry. So there's\", 'all sorts of weird and wonderful uh you', 'know mixing of possible degrees of', 'freedom in the theory that could still', 'magically leave the physics alone.', \"There's surely plenty of physicists out\", 'there are perfectly trained in all their', \"physics but don't have your math\", \"background. So in a way they're kind of\", 'researching with blinders on given how', 'much more you see in the mathematical', 'regimes. Is that a fair characterization', 'here? The the push back somebody might', \"say you know you're you're sort of\", 'torturing yourself by trying to solve', 'really hard problems in math and physics', 'at the same time. So there are lots of', \"questions where you don't need this\", 'degree of math. But unfortunately, the', 'path to the physical questions we want', 'to answer leads through this crazy hairy', 'geometry in high dimensions to be able', 'to to answer the physics we want in', \"string theory. So, we kind of don't have\", 'a choice. This evokes Einstein where I', \"don't think he was totally up on\", 'non-ucuklitian geometry, differential', \"geometry, all that. He wasn't totally up\", 'on that and needed some help, right?', 'Even though he had the physics going.', \"Oh, man. I would love to meet Einstein's\", 'tutor.', 'What do you do? I tutor Einstein in', \"geometry. That's off. Yeah.\", 'This marriage of frontier physics and', \"emergent math. I mean, this is it's been\", 'going since the very beginning. And I', 'might offer a cosmic perspective on that', 'as we close it out. All righty. One of', 'the features of research scientists in', 'academia is to get really smart people', \"working on problems where there's no\", \"obligation or expectation that there's a\", 'sellable product at the end of that', 'exercise. What it means is that the mind', 'can roam freely on the boundaries of', 'what is known and unknown in the', 'universe. And in physics that has always', 'occurred', 'has always occurred in tandem with', 'advances in mathematics. You go back to', \"ancient Greece, they're trying to\", 'measure the shape of the earth. Is it', 'round? Is it not? The word geometry gets', 'introduced. And if you look at what that', 'means, it means earth measurement.', 'Geometry.', 'And so you look at this juxtaposition of', 'our advances in science and our advances', 'in mathematics. And these are two fields', 'that so often people in school say, I', \"don't not good at math and I'm not good\", \"at physics and I'm going to meanwhile is\", 'the foundation of our understanding of', 'our place in existence in this universe.', 'So I look forward to further advances on', 'the frontier of physics and how they', 'marry with further advances in', 'mathematics. No matter how obscure it', 'might look to the passer by, one day in', \"the end, you'll be living with it as we\", 'currently are with all the trappings of', 'modern engineering, technology, and', 'society at large.', \"And that's a cosmic perspective.

We think that like', \"we're in charge. Yeah. But we're an Uber\", \"ride. That's what we are.\", '[Music]', 'This is Star Talk special edition, which', \"means I got Gary O'Reilly. Gary. Hey\", \"Neil, how you doing man? I'm good.\", 'Chuck, always good to have you man. Good', 'to be here. Of course. All right. Today,', \"yeah, I'm I'm checking out the this\", 'subject. I love it. Okay. All right. The', \"gut brain connection. Ah, some people's\", 'brains are gut.', 'Oh, we went philosophical straight away.', \"So, Gary, tell us why. What's going on\", \"in this episode? Okay, so we've had\", \"everybody for our lives tell us they've\", 'had a gut feeling about something. Gut', \"feeling. Yeah. And then we've seen\", \"people under stress dive. They don't\", 'say, \"I have a brain feeling.\" No, this', \"is exactly it. And we've seen people who\", 'are under stress dive into the fridge.', \"We've seen people who are depressed not\", 'want to eat at all. And then we kind of', 'work out that our guts are not', 'standalone systems within our body,', 'right? That there is actually a direct', 'gut brain connection.', 'So that gut feeling may actually be a', 'fact, not a fictional imagination of', 'somebody. Now imagine, just imagine', 'this, that every emotion you have has a', 'mirror image within your gut. Oh, that', 'makes sense. Right now, they call it', \"hangry, don't they? Don't they just? I'm\", \"hangry. I'm hangry. And here, spoiler\", 'pun coming. Uh, that is obviously our', \"food for thought. And now it's our time\", 'for an expert.', \"And now I'm hungry. There you go. I see\", 'what you did there. Okay, we have with', 'us here in New York City, uh, visiting', 'us at the Hayden Planetarium right here', 'in my office, a gentleman based at UCLA.', 'We have Emaran Meyer. Yes, I think I', \"said your name correctly. You're a\", \"medical doctor at UCLA. You're a\", 'gastroenterenterologist, which is a lot', \"of syllables to say you're a gut man. I\", 'think we like that. But am I correct? A', \"scrabble winner. You're also a\", 'neuroscientist. You hardly ever see', 'those two in the same phrase because', 'your brain and the gut. Well, more', 'increasingly you do now. Maybe. So, all', \"right. And you're also an author. And\", 'the books I got them here. Very very', \"simple. It's just mind and gut. Mind gut\", 'connection. Mind gut connection. That', 'was in 2016 with Harper Collins. And', 'then mind gut and you added a word', 'immune connection. Immune connection. So', 'the mind gut is taking over the the body', \"here. Yeah. All right. We'll see where\", 'that can take us. And so my notes here', \"say you're also a documentary filmmaker.\", \"What what what's up with that? Yeah. I\", \"almost um didn't go into medical school\", 'because I was fortunate. Um a retired', 'businessman invited me several times to', 'accompany him as a sound assistant to', 'places in New Guinea and um on the', 'Orinino River to the Yanomami um Indians', 'and very formative experiences and wow', 'the nice thing is I can now reconnect', 'back. I mean I was just a you know first', 'year medical student had no idea about', 'any any of the things I know today.', 'These people that we visited and and and', 'lived with the Yanomami are very', 'interesting group of people that have', 'the the healthiest microbiome on the', 'planet. So really found out that and and', 'and how they poop three times a day. I', \"was going to well that's what I was\", \"that's where I was getting. I was like\", 'how exactly did we determine that that', 'they have the healthiest body? Are you', 'digging into their poop in the forest?', 'So there was a scientist Gloria', 'Dominguez married to a very famous', 'gastroenterologist and researcher and', 'they had the interest in in studying the', 'microbes of um of peoples around the', 'world with what they call the vanishing', \"microbe. You know we're losing microbes\", 'or so they went to the Yanomami and did', \"the most elaborate analysis. didn't do\", 'it there. Obviously took the samples and', 'um it turned out that this microbial', 'system that these people had is the most', 'diverse and richest of anybody. They', 'must have thought you were crazy. Can', 'Can I have some of your poop from my lab', \"back? I don't know. I know some places\", 'in New York where you get charged extra', 'for that.', 'So, just to finish your your resume', \"here. So you're a professor in the\", 'departments of medicine, physiology and', \"psychiatry. So that's an evidence of\", 'your your breadth and what you brought', \"together for your studies and it's and\", \"it's guided me. So my career has led me\", 'down this path at starting in the gut', 'and then always having an interest in', 'the brain and the nervous system and at', 'some point they said it was necessary to', 'you know connect to these other', \"departments and that's at the David\", \"Geffin School of Medicine at UCLA. Let's\", 'just get this started. Mhm. What is the', 'brain gut connection? And if I', 'understand the timeline correctly,', 'nobody was really talking about this', 'until your books came out. Oh, really?', \"So, so you wrote the book. You're a\", 'pioneer on the brain connection. It was', \"it was a surprise to me because I've\", 'struggled in my professional career for', 'literally decades to get this concept of', 'brain gut connections accepted as a', 'major factor not just as an', 'epiphenomenon but as a major disease', 'factor in like inflammatory bowel', 'disease and irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Many of these what we call functional', 'gastrointestinal the IBS I guess. You', 'hear it all the time now. Yeah. on TV', 'commercials and um so it was like was', 'kind of amazing that enthusiasm that', 'gradually developed after the book. Not', 'the first year was not really popular', 'the first year but then gradually it', 'picked up and now if you go on on go', 'online I mean every second word is gut', 'health and bra you hear about it all the', 'time now in in more of a cursory fashion', \"you know there's not a lot of in-depth\", 'talk about it but what is your gut?', 'Well, I mean the gut I would say is the', 'after the brain the most complex organ', \"we have in the body. Okay. It's not just\", \"a digest. It's a tube from the you know\", 'from the mouse to to the anus. And for a', 'long time digestion and uh absorption', 'and storage of waste has been sort of', 'the main focus of of of interest. In the', 'meantime we know that you know 70% of', 'our immune system is embedded in the', 'gut. Big portion of our hor hormonal', 'system endocrine system is embedded in', \"the gut. There's a a separate nervous\", 'system in the gut which called been the', 'little brain. Mike Gerson here from New', 'York, Colombia sort of been a pioneer in', 'in uh describing and popularizing that', 'concept. Wait, wait, so some people', 'literally have their brain in their ass.', \"Is this what you're saying? But if you\", \"Yes, I know we probably don't know the\", \"same person, but we know they're like\", 'that. Yeah. Yeah. But but to sort of', 'ramp up this the answer, all these', 'systems in the gut are interconnected', 'with each other. Okay. So the gut is is', \"is like a brain. So who's talking to who\", 'is the brain talking to the gut or is', 'the gut talking to the brain? No. First', 'within the gut we have the immune system', 'and the um you know the microbes also', 'live in the gut and the nervous system', 'in the gut. They all communicate with', \"each other all the time. So you don't\", 'know it. You know right now if if I', 'could look inside of you with the right', 'lens you know I would see all these', 'things interacting and talking to each', 'other. Then you add the brain to it. Um', \"and it's the same thing. There's a a\", 'birectional communication going on 24/7', 'even when you sleep always anything that', 'happens at the brain level said earlier', 'has a mirror image in the gut which we', \"don't see. You see it on your face. So\", \"if you're angry I can see it on your\", 'face. We can see that the gut', \"contracting when you're angry, but also\", 'a lot of things that go on in in in the', 'gut generate emotional feelings or um', \"most of it 95% doesn't become conscious.\", \"So that that's the thing about the So we\", 'have receptors and transmitters. I can', 'say it but what are they? How are they', \"activated? How are they working? And I'm\", 'obviously not emailing each other. But', \"and just to clarify, when you said it's\", 'not conscious, it means if I understand', 'that, it means you will have a feeling', \"and you won't know why, but you'll then\", \"act on that feeling. And if it's your\", 'mind gut connection controlling it, it', \"means you have behavior that's being\", 'commanded to you by microbes that you', 'need a microscope to see. Yeah. But what', 'I want to say for a lot of people,', \"they're not aware of this, you know,\", \"they're very oblivious to the to their\", 'body. They just have urges, right? Yeah.', 'Yeah. But but like a sensation that that', 'everybody knows is uh satiation, hunger', 'and satiation. Absolutely. So these are', 'the most basic gut feelings that people', \"have. And it's so funny you say that.\", 'When I was younger, my mother used to', 'say I would eat and then I\\'d say, \"I\\'m', 'still hungry.\" And she would say, \"Just', 'wait 10 minutes and your stomach will', 'talk to your brain and let it know that', \"you're not hungry. We'll catch up with\", 'the Yeah, your brain will catch up with', 'your stomach.\" And I don\\'t think I don\\'t', 'know where she got that from, but damn', \"if that's not the case. Yeah. A lot of\", 'people have lost that that mechanism,', 'you know, like a big part about obesity', 'is that that that signal that comes from', 'the gut, this GLP1, this molecule that', 'everybody talks about, everybody talks', 'about is produced in cells in the gut', 'and goes to the your hypothalamus in in', 'your brain and tells your brain to stop', \"eating because you're full. A lot of\", 'people have lost that that mechanism,', \"that feedback. Um why that is, but it's\", 'not clear. But so what do you now do', 'with mega doses of this hormone, right?', '100 times higher than what your gut', 'produces. These are the GLP-1 injections', 'that everybody sees on TV now, right? So', 'that that gives you that sensation. But', 'you know, in a in a GLP1, excuse me, got', 'a pharmacist sitting here among us. We', \"can't help it. It's on every TV\", \"channel. That's true. And by the way,\", 'how do you think I lost 20 pounds? So', \"you're saying so this I didn't know\", 'this. So this chemical that we see', 'advertised a 100 times a day. Yeah. Is', 'that molecule but heightened to create', 'this sensation that really your body', 'should have been producing all along.', 'Yeah. Uh it does a lot of other things.', \"We we don't know many of them because\", 'now all of a sudden you know it seems to', 'be effective in substance use disorders.', 'People who take it find that their urged', 'to drink. So people who have an alcohol', 'abuse problem they stop abusing alcohol.', 'They\\'re like, \"Yeah, I just didn\\'t want', 'to drink or you know.\" So, and you know,', \"it's it's kind of ironic when I first\", 'came to LA as a as a research student. I', 'I studied that that that hormone, you', \"know, and also it's\", \"sibling called GIP that that there's\", 'another medication that has that. And at', \"the time, we didn't know. We were just\", 'excited to find all these substances in', 'the gut, but nobody had a clue what they', 'do. It it took really literally 35 years', 'or 40 years before. So, I know you got a', 'bunch of questions here, but I want to', 'establish something. How was this', 'received when you emerged with this idea', 'that your brain and your gut are', 'connected in ways no one understood', 'previously? Because, as I understand', 'medical school, you study the brain, you', 'study the brain, you study the gut, you', \"study the gut, and there's a siloing of\", 'the body where we are just bits and', 'pieces assembled into one thing.', \"Absolutely. And the idea that there's a\", 'connection will require that somebody in', 'that mix has interest in more than one', 'aspect of the human physiology. Yeah.', \"And I I would say, you know, I've had a\", 'long-standing interest in college on in', 'psychology and you know read all the', 'stuff Yungian stuff and uh so I I came', 'into medical school already with this', 'background in you know in in in brain', 'science with a perspective. Yeah. Yeah.', 'with the perspective and I would', 'actually say that the main reason I', 'ended up in medical school I I thought I', 'was going to go into psychiatry because', 'I but then spending a month in a', 'psychiatry rotation convinced me this is', 'not what I want to do', 'those people are okay never mind okay I', 'might do it today I might do it today', 'because psychiatry has moved on a lot', 'really has yeah but I had a very', 'open-minded um a very charismatic uh', 'mentor who really supported me in you', 'know from the beginning. Yeah. So he was', 'interested in isolating all these', 'molecules like the GLP1 not necessarily', 'on the brain and I said can we combine', 'this you know with with the brain and he', 'was very open-minded um unusual and but', 'most of my colleagues either ignored it', \"didn't find that interesting or then\", 'there were like in the IBS field for', 'example there there were like really', 'entrenched interests of people that say', 'IBS is a gut disorder right forget about', 'the brain you know And which is so', 'counterintuitive from the fact that when', \"we're all kids, we learn that the\", \"hipbone is connected to it's as simple\", 'as that. All the bones are connected to', 'like you would think that it would be', 'just you know the gut bone connected to', 'the brain. It would make perfect sense,', \"right? It's the first thing we learn\", 'when we learn anatomy', 'day', 'one. So, but but it goes further than', 'that. I I think you know med western', 'medicine very successful obviously in', 'many aspects but it is based on a', 'reductionistic view of the body not an', 'interconnected not a systems biological', \"and it's gradually changing from the\", \"there's a couple of developments like\", \"there's an entity now called functional\", 'medicine non-scientific entity but also', \"in science there's more and more\", 'scientists that think in system', 'interconnectivity between the systems so', \"it It'll it will take another 10 years,\", 'I think, and then it will it will', \"change. I mean, they'll catch up with\", 'you.', 'How about that? We spoke about GOP1, but', \"you've got cortisol and serotonin. Yes.\", 'The stress. I suppose we love eating. We', 'have an experience when we eat certain', \"foods that maybe you'll tell me yes or\", 'no with serotonin being released in the', 'gut or dopamine. And then the cult, like', \"I say, you're diving into the fridge\", \"because you're under stress and you're\", 'going for the sugars or the fats or', 'whatever it is. I mean, how long did it', 'take us to work all of that out? And and', \"and we've got this image of the person\", 'who just broke up. Yeah. With their', 'their loved one, a gallon of ice cream,', \"watching a a sad movie crying. What's up\", \"with that? That's what sad movies do.\", 'The gut likes Hogenas ice cream or any', 'other ice cream. Yeah. So, so,', \"so there's some very smart people that\", 'worked in this area. So, surprisingly,', 'it was never really identified as the', 'brain gut connection. You know, they', 'always talked about appetite and uh', 'stress and substance use disorders, but', 'but it never really became sort of an', \"essential part of but but that's really\", 'how it started. You know, we knew these', 'things for for quite some time. very', 'good scientific studies support it but', \"but it's not really become a specialty\", \"you know it's because of this dominant\", \"paradigm I think it's not\", \"so going back to Chuck's uh insight into\", 'anatomy', 'that the kneebone is connected to', 'several other things in connected to the', 'brain bone so how how is the gut', 'connected a to the autonomic system and', 'then the vagus nerve spelled with an a', 'not an e and what does the vagus nerve', \"do because we've heard about it I\", \"couldn't tell you actually where it is\", \"in the body but it's right\", 'Yeah, the Vegas nerve. Okay. Above your', 'clavicle where your neck is and it runs', 'down. Why are you telling me this and', 'not the the the good doctor? All right,', \"doc. Tell us where where's the Vegas\", 'nerve?', 'Where you said exactly?', 'Yeah. So, the Vegas nerve, first of all,', \"it's a it's a birectional pathway. You\", \"know, it's like a birectional freeway.\", 'Okay. most of the traffic goes from the', 'gut to the brain to the brain stem and', 'then to higher emotional centers and 10%', 'goes the other way. Um so for example to', 'stimulate your the acid production in', \"your stomach that's a veagal phenomenon\", \"that's why people used to do cut the\", 'vagus nerve for ulcer disease. This was', 'a dominant Wow. Wow. Which which is', 'amazing when you think about this is', 'only like 30 years ago that we have', 'absolutely no understanding. Cutting off', 'your foot because you have an ingrown', \"toenail. Exactly. That's insane. Wait.\", 'So where where on your body is the vagus', 'nerve? It goes down from your brain', 'stem. Okay. Down your neck. Um, just', 'like that sounds like just what Chuck', 'Knight said. And then did Chuck say that', '90 seconds ago?', 'Just tells you not. Okay. So, but but', \"what's important is to realize so the\", 'Vegas nerve has branches to all your', 'organs. It monitors every organ function', 'seven 24/7. The ones to the gut have', 'received a lot of attention because we', 'were always wondering why is 90% of the', 'traffic going from the gut to the brain.', \"There's not that much happening that the\", 'brain needs to know. So now we know', \"there's all these receptors on the vagus\", 'nerve for serotonin for for these for', 'GLP1 for the GIP. So', 'disproportionate what we call afrant or', 'sensory signal to the brain is related', 'to this complexity that goes on in and', 'and in in the gut and the signals it', \"gets from the microbes. It's a\", \"processing hub. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm still\", 'confused. How does any of that relate to', 'your immune system? So the immune system', 'I told you more than 70% is located in', 'the gut. Sandwiched between the layers', 'seven zeros 70 zero. Wow. Sandwiched', 'between the layers of the gut and in', 'very close communication to the microbes', 'in the gut. Microns away you know. So', 'how nature could engineer something like', \"that. That's potentially deadly\", 'influence of micro. So a micron is a', 'millionth of an inch. I mean a millionth', 'of a of a meter I guess of a meter.', 'Right. So that would be a thousandth of', 'a millimeter. Yeah. would be a micron.', 'Yeah. Yeah. So the immune system is very', 'close to the vagus. Some of these sensor', 'nerves go into the into this immune', 'system in the gut and they pick up', 'signals that that the immune system', 'produces like cytoines for example best', 'studied and that has all kinds of', 'effects on your behavior you know like', 'cytoines um fatigue chronic pain', 'some oh yeah I well I got to come at so', 'pause', 'then what is the urge that people have', 'to what do you do the when they clean', 'out the colon uh a cleanse cleanse this', \"is urge to get it all out oh I'm gonna I\", 'can answer that for a doctor and or', 'people prepping for a colonoscopy', \"they're cleaning everything out so all\", 'these microbes that set up shop to', 'communicate with the brain they just', 'flow out your body just for the benefit', 'of one of your colleagues to look up', 'your butt okay and so are we destroying', 'this hard-earned ed microbiome every', 'time we get ready. Um, oh, Chuck had an', \"answer. What's your answer, Dr. Chuck?\", \"Okay, so here's my answer. Uh, for the\", \"cleanse, that's So, that's the\", \"first human but yeah. No, no, I'm\", 'saying the actual cleanse itself. I', \"mean, I know it's supposed to get rid of\", \"your stuff. That was a joke. Oh, I'm\", \"sorry. Wasn't that a good joke? Oh, I\", 'thought you were saying it like Okay,', \"never mind. You said it's No,\", \"you said no. You said no, it's human\", 'See, we missed the No, cuz I would', \"have laughed at that cuz that's funny.\", \"Excuse me. I'm sorry. I missed. But the\", \"colonoscopy that's so that they can look\", 'at your intestinal lining and the good', \"stuff that's that you need is in the\", 'walls of your intestinal lining. So', 'cleaning that out so they can look at', \"it, you're not getting rid of. So Okay.\", 'Yeah. So two answers from my side. The', 'first one I would contradict what you', \"said because oh you think it's real. So\", 'well you know aruveetic medicine for', 'thousands of years has propagated these', 'these these colonic cleanses. All right.', 'So what is the what is the benefit?', \"Let's because everything I read says\", 'that the benefits are negligible at the', 'best. Okay. Unless wait that would be', 'health benefits but suppose you just', \"feel better. Doesn't that count? I mean\", \"you know doesn't that we talking about\", 'how you feel better when I punch a', \"puppy? Does that make it I'm sorry. Did\", 'I say that out loud? Okay. Yes. Anyway,', \"tell me tell me why it's\", 'good before I get arrested. So, so for a', 'long time, this has been dominated or', 'driven or motivated by this concept of', 'cleansing. So, humans are obsessed with', 'cleansing. You know, they they they', 'spend a lot of money on on cleansing.', 'So, not just cleansing the colon, but a', 'cleansing diet and in not 19th century', 'Europe, but in modern times. Yes.', \"Cleansing. But it's become very popular\", 'again. Talking about your ancestors. I', 'know. I need I need to dig.', 'take a bath once a year and only if', \"necessary. Yeah, but it's our birthday.\", 'You got to celebrate.', 'Okay. So, so with with microbiome', \"science, um there's a certain potential\", 'explanation why people have been doing', 'this over thousands of years. Why? Well,', 'because it reestablishes a a balance', 'within, you know, within your colonic', 'microbiome. Okay. has not been studied', \"scientifically, but it's certainly\", \"you're saying it's feasible though. So\", \"even though it's not even though we\", \"don't have empirical scientific\", \"peer-reviewed studies, it's a feasible\", 'concept that this could be the case. It', \"is it is conceivable and it's so the\", \"blueprint for your microbiome doesn't\", 'disappear with that. So you cleanse out', 'the the population, the blueprint is', 'there and it can re the body can', \"reconstruct the the Okay, so it's a jump\", 'start. Jump start a jump start. All', 'right, fine. I changed my mind on that.', 'Stripping off a stripping off a layer of', 'paint and then just it re reevolves', 'itself to bring a new layer of paint.', \"It's nice and shiny. So if our microbes\", 'are not important in our gut over', \"evolution, we'd have got rid of them.\", \"It's like sleep. We are never more\", \"vulnerable than when we're asleep,\", \"right? Yet we've not evolved to do\", \"without sleep. Why haven't we evolved to\", 'do without microbes in our gut? What?', \"How? How come this? Because they're the\", \"OGs. They're the original life forms on\", \"this planet. They've been here for 4\", 'billion years. You know, three and a', \"half billion. Can't get more OG than\", 'that. Sure. Three and a half billion', 'people. Original gut, you know, nicely', \"done. Thank you. But it's been the most\", 'successful evolutionary development', 'because every organism today from the', 'cockroach to the butterfly to humans has', 'a microbiome, a gut microbiome. Wow.', \"There there's not a a complex. So there\", \"there's a number I calculated and it\", 'just freaks people out that if you go to', 'your large intestine and take one', 'centimeter slice through it, just one', \"centimeter. One centimeter. That's\", '4/10en of an inch for those who for', \"Americans. Americans. America. That's\", \"right. Don't bring any of that metric\", 'crap over here. Talking about America,', 'boy. You better talk to me in inches.', 'You know talking about millimeters,', 'centimeters. that 4/10en of an inch', 'lives and works more microbes than the', 'total number of humans who have ever', 'been born.', 'Wow. So that we we we think that like', \"we're in charge. Yeah. But we're just a\", 'darkened anorobic vessel of fecal matter', \"for microbes. We're an Uber ride. That's\", \"what we are. We're an Uber ride for\", 'microscopic organisms. Microbes.', 'Yeah. I read something recently in a', 'book by one of my favorite scientific', 'authors, Antonio Damasio, um on this', 'comparison, the early life forms, you', 'know, which which had a lot of', 'intelligence. I mean, these microbes on', 'the planet must have a phenomenal amount', 'of intelligence collected over three and', \"a half billion years, but they couldn't\", 'do long division. So', \"yeah, but but I mean they don't have a\", 'mind and obviously they can do they they', 'can live in homeostasis with each other', 'and with the world. Their main benefit', 'is that they now can connect to our', 'brains and can influence a much a', 'conscious entity. But what I mean so', \"they do have a mind. So if we've got the\", 'original gut microbes, the OGs as we now', 'like to refer to them, three and a half', \"billion years, they've invented their\", \"own language. They've got they've had to\", 'have an own their own alphabet of sorts.', 'So how are they communicating with us', 'from their little hideyhole in the gut?', 'You know, they have millions of genes', 'compared to our, you know, meek number', 'of 10,00ands. In these genes is stored', 'all this information how to build these', 'molecules, how to how to use them. So', 'their language is basically stored in in', 'in in their genome. So their own history', 'of three', 'and three. No, I was I was about to', 'swear before I got to the B billions and', 'billions. Okay. So then when they', 'settled the first microbes settled in', 'this floating tubes uh of the first you', 'know marine animals they interacted with', \"these floating tubes and there's\", 'something called lateral gene transfer', 'that they transferred some of these', 'genes that they had about their language', 'into these animals and you know fast', 'forward that was the first version of', 'the so-called the little brain of the', 'gut or the interic nervous system and', 'then with animals developing heads', 'becoming polar organisms. Some of the', 'same information about language was', 'transferred to the brain. What is a', 'polar organism? Having a head and the', 'opposite end whatever that is. Okay.', 'Okay. Yeah. So our language, our ability', 'to think comes uses the same building', 'blocks as the microbes developed over', 'billions of years. I mean that to me is', 'one of the more fascinating ideas.', 'Incredibly fascinating. So seeing as how', 'we have the gut brain connection, seeing', 'as have microbes have their way of', 'communicating with us, is this the super', 'highway that is used for psychedelics?', \"Because we're ingesting and yet\", \"everything's going off up here in the\", 'brain. Mh. But not so much down in the', 'gut. So is there sort of exploration?', 'There are a lot of things going on in', \"the gut that we don't know yet. like\", 'serotonin plays a big role as as as you', 'know with the the psychedelic', 'experiences activating a particular', 'serotonin receptor the 5H2A receptor', 'which is in in in the brain. So these', 'psychedelic experiences seem many of', 'them seem to be related to that receptor', 'in in the brain. Now the same receptor', 'is also in the gut and on microbes and', \"we don't know what effect um this\", \"actually has but one and it can't be an\", \"accident right it's not an accident it's\", 'a co-evolutionary', 'thing right okay so is the is the mind', \"desperate to try and expand and that's\", \"why it's so active to find something\", 'like these psychedelics and then just', 'whiz them up to the brain yeah I mean', 'humans have probably used psychedelics', 'for a long long time a long long time', 'And based on their experiences initially', 'by accident that they ingested a', 'mushroom all of a sudden sort of world', 'is that the sort of when you talk about', 'in evolution they just by accident', 'eating a mushroom is that sort of the', 'beginning of a stoned ape theory of', 'evolution phrase stoned ape. Yeah. Yeah.', 'Okay. What is what is the stoned ape? I', \"mean I've been to the zoo but I've never\", 'seen him you know an ape.', 'I would love I would just love to sit', 'there and watch a chimpanzeee tripping', 'his balls off. I would love that. But I', \"haven't had the pleasure of seeing.\", \"Well, in out in the wild, I'm guessing\", \"they'll stumble across a mushroom, be\", 'curious, and eat it and go, \"Whoa.\" So,', \"isn't the basis of where Gary's coming\", 'from? Why do we have receptors for', 'psychedelics at all, unless it was the', 'purview of the microbiome that delighted', \"in it? Yeah, that's a really interesting\", \"question. I I I I can't really answer\", 'it. I can only say partially based on', 'personal experience. I guess I can say', \"this here even though it's you know it's\", \"it's it's not I'm not recommending for\", \"people. I am I'm recommending for you to\", 'do it. All right. The the good doctor', \"here can't I'm letting you know\", 'everybody should do psychedelics. I mean', \"I can't do it for legal medical legal\", 'reason and sue me please but do it. But', 'the experience you know that you have', \"and everybody says this it's it's a\", \"universal human experience. It's not\", 'that one person gets this this this', 'realization of the interconnectedness of', 'yourself with the with your environment', 'the planet like you get a totally', 'different paradigm. Oh yes. So you Chuck', 'you Oh god. Yes. You missed a few shows', 'a few while back because you you I', 'traveled to Costa Rica to do Iawaska for', 'an entire week. Wow. And uh I will tell', 'you that it changed my entire life. It', 'changed my perspective on everything.', 'Did you get funnier? Not at all. And', 'that and you know what? While I was in', 'my one of my uh while I was in one of my', 'uh transmeditative states, uh Mother Ya', 'came to me and said, \"I I I can\\'t help', 'you with the funny son. I\\'m so sorry.\"', 'Okay. So, just to be clear, when you did', 'this, it was a fully supervised Oh, god.', 'Yeah. Activity. I you know, they are', \"licensed. They're fully supervised and\", 'they have medical staff on on hand. It', \"wasn't somebody who sold you some on the\", 'street. nobody on your back, by the way.', 'Now, that I do not recommend. I say', 'please find a professional and have', 'somebody there to supervise. Make sure', \"that there's medical staff on hand. Do\", \"not go to somebody's house. Okay? And do\", 'not go to some dude with a ponytail', 'who\\'s just like, \"Dude, I\\'ve been a', 'shaman for like so long now and I would', 'love to turn you on to the universe.\"', \"Yeah. But if he doesn't have a ponytail,\", \"it's okay. And it's and it's not a party\", \"drug. No, it's not. Yeah. If you're\", \"looking to get high, don't do it because\", \"it's not that kind of high. Right. Yeah.\", 'Yeah. So, like one of my speculations is', 'I mean again partially based on on on', \"self experience. So there's different\", 'phases to the psychedelic experience.', \"You there's the the initial you know\", 'rush that you get and with a lot of', 'visual and auditory experiences but then', 'it has this long-lasting effect.

So I I', \"that's easy to understand knowing that\", 'it interferes with brain neurosynapses.', 'How does that connect back to the gut?', 'Well, the slow effect, you know, I mean', 'the thing that what what happens in your', \"brain initially is a fast response. It's\", 'being absorbed in the small intestine.', 'Oh, because you ingest it. Yeah. You', \"ingest it and it's got to get through\", 'your So it only gets to your brain as', 'the as the microbiome allows it. Right.', \"True. But it's it's the part that is not\", 'absorbed in your small intestine which', 'happens immediately after ingestion.', \"It's the part that goes down to your\", 'colon and then these longerlasting', 'effects. I would not be surprised if', \"they're mediated by microbial, you know,\", 'they add things to it when they', 'stimulate it with the 5HDA 2A receptor.', 'They produce other molecules that then', 'create this long-term experience.

How much', 'of that can we blame on our micro biome?', 'Our current knowledge is pretty much', 'based on what we call association', 'studies or correlations. You take a big', 'population of people that have a', 'particular diagnosis and then you look', \"at their gut microbiome and it's\", 'different. You have to even know to do', 'that as as part of the study, right? But', \"it doesn't prove causality. That that's\", 'the thing. So I give you a few examples.', 'I I think uh anxiety', \"in my opinion I've studied this for for\", 'pretty intensely for the first part of', 'my career. We know so many mechanisms in', 'the brain that you know and the effect', 'of early life adversity that predispose', 'you to have greater anxiety. So we know', 'so much about the brain mechanisms that', \"some people try to propose you know it's\", 'your microbes that cause anxiety. Has', 'has any of your research gone into diet', \"relation to Alzheimer's development?\", \"Yes. So we're part of a big um US\", 'European consortium on Alzheimer disease', \"funded by the NIH. There's definitely\", 'pretty strong evidence that the NIH', 'National Institute National Institutes', 'of Health said about that. Thank God.', 'Thank God we have it. Yeah. Well, thank', 'God we have it now. What time is it?', 'What time is it? Let me tell you', 'something. Now you sound like flavor', 'flight. Yeah.', \"And I would say there's there's pretty\", 'solid evidence that again what we call', 'dispiosis or altered composition of the', 'gut microbiome plays a role and there', \"may be heterogeneity you know it's not\", 'ultimacy is not one disease maybe', 'different pathways', 'diet and what we now you know is become', 'sort of the magic word systemic immune', 'activation or systemic inflammation is', 'clearly one of the main risk factors for', \"not just Alzheimer's but also all the\", \"other ones like Parkinson's and but um\", \"Alzheimer's is also it's it's\", 'interesting so anything preventive for', 'any of these chronic diseases you want', \"to go to what's been referred to as an\", \"anti-inflammatory diet basically that's\", 'an emergent awareness of our health yeah', 'is that is that butyrate', 'anti-inflammatory the phen yeah and', 'butyrate polyphenols and those sort of', 'things a large planted', \"once you have Alzheimer's severe\", \"symptoms there's evidence that a\", 'ketogenic diet you know which in is not', 'a good diet for the average person', 'because it starves your microbes but in', \"that case it's beneficial and there's\", 'one disease entity refractory seizures', 'in young children where ketogenic diet', 'is also my god ketogenic is is basically', 'protein all the time fat and protein fat', 'and protein Keeping your body in', 'ketosis, a state of keto, right? Right.', \"Which means that you don't have access\", 'to sugars or any carbohydrates. Your', 'body basically uses just the fat. Yeah.', 'So, and of course presumably before we', 'were agrarian, our ancestors, they ate', 'dead animals, right? Or berries, of', 'course, if they could find them. But,', 'uh, they were that the caveman diet is', 'this correct? Well, but you know, going', 'back to my personal experience on the as', 'a caveman,', 'you had to say that. No, it was it was I', 'was just hanging there. It was just', \"hanging there. I didn't living with the\", 'Yanomami on the Afarinoa River. I mean,', \"so they're surrounded by by animals, you\", 'know, by birds, by fish, the big', 'mammals. They only eat a very small', 'amount of of of of animal products.

That's why they\", 'have the healthy microbi and and that', 'has been studied all the way a colleague', 'of mine at UCLA Ela Sha all the way into', 'the production of neurotrans of GABA', 'this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the', \"brain on a ketogenic diet that's sort of\", 'like Valium you know it it sort of tuned', 'tones down the nervous system.

I know you've\", 'been doing this research for decades,', 'but just how much more of this do we not', 'know yet? What can we look forward to?', \"Yeah. I I think we're just scratching on\", 'the surface surface. Oh, really? Yeah. I', 'think Well, I was just think about these', 'millions of of genes that the microbes', 'have.

So, if someone prepping for', 'a colonoscopy, they just got rid of the', 'entire population of microbes. So, why', 'other than the value of the exam to', 'prevent colon cancer? How do you get', \"back your microbiome if it's all in the\", 'toilet? It comes back fairly quickly.', \"You know, it I I would say where's the\", \"recipe? Wait, who's who? Oh, the So, so\", 'the blueprints to reassemble it is in', \"your gun inside. But don't I'm asking\", \"the medical doctor here. Well, I'm\", 'telling you.', 'Did I ask the two of you? No. But you', 'got it anyway.', 'Yeah. So, you need to know. So, okay.', \"So, you're saying we we are chemically\", 'equipped to reproduce the', 'microbiome that is suitable for us.

But if you look\", 'at this like a few weeks later, a few', \"months later, the person's own\", 'microbiome is being reassembled.', 'And the reason is possible because the', 'microbes are not just floating inside', 'the lumen, the inside of the gut, but', 'they also inhabit the mucosal lining.', \"And that's probably where that\", 'information is stored of the blueprints.', \"And that's exactly what comes back.\", \"Yeah, I did say that earlier, but that's\", 'okay.', \"That's I you know I don't need to be\", 'right.

And can gut', 'health fix that? Yeah. So yeah, this is', 'something that myself and my group have', 'studied for, you know, like I would say', \"four four decades. You're failing badly\", 'because people still have it. Get back', 'to work. What are you doing here? Well,', 'fortunately, finally, after 30 years of,', 'you know, writing articles and review', \"articles on it, it's basically called a\", 'a disorder of altered gut brain', 'interactions.

we have Lena McGrath she', \"wres hello Neil I'm Lena from Orlando\", 'where do photons come from for instance', 'are they already inside my birthday', 'candles or are they created from the', 'fire oh

I've seen the Emoji can you\", 'touch it can you grab it can you hold it', \"not really so what is it so that's a\", 'famous essay from the from the 19th', 'century so a photon is a packet of', 'energy a pure energy and it moves at the', 'speed of', \"light it's the only thing it knows how\", 'to do is move at the speed of light and', 'so if by the way energy can manifest in', 'a dozen many different ways okay you can', 'have potential energy now why is it that', 'you can harm yourself by jumping out of', \"a window okay there there's a reason for\", 'it because when you hit the ground', 'energy killed you I thought it was the', 'sidewalk', 'okay you had energy in your body yeah', 'while you were falling one Red Bull', 'right before the show right and that oh', 'yes and the energy kept accumulating as', 'you fell faster and faster right then', 'you hit the sidewalk all the energy that', 'was in', 'you from your motion kinetic energy goes', 'back into you as mechanical energy and', 'the only way your body can accommodate', 'mechanical energy is to Break Stuff', 'because it takes energy to break your', 'bones sure energy can manifest in', 'different ways and the higher you take', 'the elevator before you jump out the', 'window the more energy you have to break', 'your bones upon hitting the sidewalk', \"that's why jumps from higher altitudes\", 'will do more damage than from lower', \"altitud but if you're watching this and\", \"thinking about it don't do it do not try\", 'this at home now above a certain height', \"there's a air resistance you hit what's\", 'called a terminal velocity where the air', 'is absorbing away some of that ener', 'about to terminate to be terminated', 'terminal velocity to be terminated so', 'there are other ways that energy can be',

'electron at a higher energy level and', 'something happens to make a drop to a', 'lower energy level it just lost energy', 'where did it go actually it can go in', 'one of two places if another atom

'all right so but occasionally it just', 'sort of jostles it the electron de', 'excites goes to a lower energy level', 'where does that energy go bada bing a', 'phot is released from the atom of', 'exactly the same energy as the', 'difference between the energy levels of', 'the electron all the energy is is is', 'accounted for and so and the photon goes', 'in in a random Direction at the speed

a skinny candle\", 'you dip it again and it keeps building', 'layers and layers until there the', \"thickness you want okay that's one way\", \"to make it that's as you make a a dip C\", 'another just

'Las', 'Vegas well let me let me preface this by', 'saying back in the', '1980s the my community of physicists the', 'American physical Society the aps there', 'have annual meetings and one of them was', 'scheduled for San Diego uh San Diego', 'especially of late is a big convention', 'Town Comic Con you know the most famous', \"of the world's comiccons takes place\", 'there the whole city sort of adjusts for', \"it there's a convention center and\", 'everything anyhow the community of', 'physicists had booked hotels and was', 'ready and it turned out there was a', 'snafu where the hotel reservations', \"failed for some reason and I don't\", \"remember why so here's this convention\", \"That was supposed to happen and it can't\", 'happen so what do you do well the MGM', 'Grand then the MGM Marina in Vegas say', \"we'll take you we are the largest hotel\", 'in the country we can take you on short', 'notice so the aps pivoted to Vegas', \"pivoted and so that Year's convention\", 'was in Vegas where people give talks and', 'their public talks and and professional', 'talks and this sort of thing all right a', \"lot of breakout rooms it's where we sort\", 'of reconnect especially in an era before', \"there was much emailing going on it's a\", \"geek it's a geek Fest geekfest thank you\", 'physics geekfest well a week later there', 'was a headline this is after the', 'conference physicists in', 'town lowest Casino take', 'ever the American physical Society has', 'been asked to never return to the city', \"that's great and so you can ask well did\", 'the physicist sort of know the odds and', \"play the odds no they just didn't didn't\", 'play because here it is it is the only', 'activity where the people tell you we', 'are legally cheating', 'you now we just want you to know this', 'when you come in the reason why we say', 'good luck is because we already win', 'and the great thing is CH when you start', 'when you get a little bit of a run going', 'if you that ever happens they see you', 'and they bring you they bring you free', 'drinks well I was going to', 'say any place where that brings you free', \"drinks there's a trap\", \"somewhere there's nobody that says hey\", 'just drink up all my liquor and uh yeah', \"and that's all we're good no\", \"so no here's a cat\", 'cabinet like I have some I had a party', 'where my best friend at the', 'time opened up my cabinet and took out a', 'bottle of the Mallen 30-year-old', \"Scott right which I don't share with\", 'anybody okay and proceeded to pour off', 'my Mallen to my other friends and I went', 'around and picked up the glasses what', \"the hell are you doing this you don't\", 'get to this this is so anybody giving', \"you free liquor is a catch that's all\", 'there is to it so that lets you know', 'what what Vegas is up to nice to know', \"nice to know you've let that go Chuck\", 'yeah Chuck is still in therapy for many', 'things many things that is that is one', \"of them yeah so I I thought I'd look a\", 'little more deeply into this only to', 'discover that if you look at various', 'branches of mathematics yeah right of', 'which there are many but let me list a', \"few let's go in sort of historical order\", \"there's sort of geometry Geo geometry\", 'means Earth measurement by the way yeah', 'from I guess that would be Greek', 'geometry Earth measurement you have', 'geometry you have', 'arithmetic you have algebra which is the', 'terrorist version of Mathematics', \"Algebra I'm sorry I'm just move on let's\", 'keep', 'moving jebra uh you uh we keep going you', \"can get to calculus there's\", 'trigonometry yeah whole branches of math', \"that we remember even if you're part of\", 'the walking wounded of those classes we', 'remember these from perhaps as early as', 'Middle School certainly high school if', 'you sequence these do you realize all of', 'those branches of math', 'were discovered in vented before it', 'occurred to anyone to take the average', 'of numbers okay oh interesting I see', \"what you're saying okay\", \"yes that's weird that is that's weird\", 'when you think about that so here are', 'these numbers you add them together', 'divide by the total somebody had to do', \"that first okay that didn't happen until\", 'uh when when did I have late 18th', 'century long after calculus Newton had', 'calculus in the bag okay by the late', '1600s early 1700s calculus people and', 'now someone later on says H let me sum', 'these numbers together and divide and', \"see if that means anything well that's\", 'early statistics right and there books', 'as late as the', '1800s that believed these are official', 'math books that described how you can', 'influence the outcome of a certain set', 'of probabilities because they believed', 'that was the case because probability', 'and statistics was not yet properly', 'formulated as an authentic and Bonafide', 'branch of mathematics right point is why', 'is that so how is it that people we in', 'our species can say we need', \"calculus and there's no probability okay\", 'there must be some something absent in', 'brain wiring yeah that prevents us from', 'thinking natively in this space yeah', \"it's it's it's called heuristic\", \"huous it's that's who we are because\", 'outcomes are what we want them to be not', 'what the math says and we still do that', 'we still do that we still do do that to', 'this day are we not hardwired Neil to', 'calculate risk as a survival mechanism', 'well okay so if you speak with sort of', 'evolutionary biologists', 'uh they will frequently and I think', 'without much um debate tell you that we', 'do make certain assessments yeah for', 'example if this will take us to an', 'aspect of how the brain works but', \"consider there's something that repeats\", 'multiple times and you learn that and it', 'hurts you yeah then you say well let me', \"not do that again so then you don't and\", 'then you avoid it so this is this is', 'simple so this is the act of how', 'repeated', 'occurrences decide for you what the', 'future is going to be all right and this', 'this matters for survival my favorite', 'survival fact is how we put order on', \"things even if there's no order there\", 'that has extraordinary consequences', \"exactly let's look at how it might have\", \"begun so we're in the serengetti and you\", \"don't want to get eaten by a lion and\", \"there's the grass you know the the grass\", 'is blowing in the breeze and you say to', \"yourself I wonder if there's a lion\", 'there in fact I think there is let me go', 'check yeah yeah right okay this will', 'summarily remove sort of the Curiosity', 'Gene', \"in because because you don't you don't\", 'get to have children to be curious if it', \"is a lion it is a lion you'll get to\", 'have curious children to the extent that', 'curiosity is is inherited okay so it', 'turns out we are better off thinking', \"there's a lion in the grass right\", 'whether or not there is and then going', 'in the opposite', \"direction than not thinking there's a\", 'lion in the grass missing it and having', 'it eat us but consider that we think', \"there's a lion in the brush whether or\", \"not there is one and that's the genes\", 'that got protected okay okay so this is', 'pattern recognition we will see patterns', \"even if there isn't a pattern there we\", 'can put a set of random dots right and', 'you say oh I see this and I see that you', 'must have done that on purpose because I', 'see it and your life experience', 'overrides the mathematics of what just', 'happened and or your life expectations', 'or your life belief system overrides it', 'the patent recognition NE is the', 'probability that that will happen as you', 'say from experience and we use this in', 'sport a lot from from analyzing gameplay', 'so let me bring this to the present we', 'have this feature in our brain wiring to', \"detect patterns even if they aren't\", 'there because that was in the interest', \"of our survival we're not making those\", 'same decisions anymore about whether we', \"might get eaten by a lion but that's\", 'still that that brain feature remains', 'within us and we see patterns in', 'everything and we think because we see a', 'pattern that the pattern is real even we', 'think the absence of patterns is a', 'pattern you at a roulette table and I', \"say why you keep betting on seven it's\", 'due', \"it's and I said how do you know it's do\", 'because the roulette table shows you the', 'previous 10 roles okay spins or the', \"previous 20 and you you don't see a\", \"seven it's due no it's not D go take a\", \"freaking probability class yeah it's a\", \"it's not due the same way the Washington\", 'generals are not do to beat the Harlem', 'glob trods yeah how about that they play', \"the Washington generals I don't know\", \"what they're called now I don't know\", 'like 40 years', 'ago so uh this this notion that because', \"it hasn't happened recently it's bound\", 'to happen in your next bet', 'is how casinos make money casinos exist', 'to exploit these', 'of the human brain wiring they exist for', 'that purpose but it goes back to the', 'point you had about magicians the', 'casinos know more about how you think', 'than you do yes and they manipulate that', \"obviously and it's completely\", 'manipulated and like like Chuck said', 'they tell you that going tell you', \"straight up hey by the way we're going\", 'to cheat you today enjoy yourself by the', 'way as a scientist we know how important', 'probability is to separate your own bias', 'on what is going on in the world from', 'what is objectively going on in the', 'world so every year I was in school we', 'had some element of probability and', 'statistics taught related to the aspect', 'of the of the sciences that we were', 'addressing so I would say all told I', 'might have had eight years of', 'probability in

Me he just says go out go', \"ahead go for it if he doesn't like it\", \"he's going to slam you down but never\", 'mind okay here it is you know the state', 'lottery systems yeah Lottery uh do you', 'know how they get funding for that and', \"what they you know there's tax levied on\", 'that do you know where that money goes', 'to typically well they tell you that', \"it's for education education let's\", \"assume that's true let's even assume\", \"that's true so it's for education and I\", \"said oh that's it public education you\", 'know K through 12 and then I looked at', 'the curricula across the country of what', \"is taught and probability if it's taught\", \"at all is only an elective it's not a\", 'fundamental part of the math', 'curriculum and so it occurred to me that', \"as long as they don't teach probability\", 'in school you are susceptible to playing', 'the lottery which funds the school which', 'funds the school yeah paying for your', 'education probability it could be the', 'end of the state lottery system well', 'yeah because anybody who knows something', 'about probability does not play the', 'lottery as a matter of fact', 'uh my father used to tell me uh take a', 'dollar a day the dollar you would play', 'the lottery start right now and just', 'take that everyday dollar and put it in', 'the bank and through compound interest', 'uh it will take 20 years but you will', 'hit the', \"Lottery that's good yeah people trying\", 'to assess their health or their Security', 'based on risk risk factors and I I think', 'in the book I there are people who smoke', \"knowing that there's a risk of cancer\", \"yeah and I think if you're an active\", \"smoker there's a one in eight chance\", 'that your Tombstone will say died of', 'lung cancer and so then I

not\", \"even a number that's what a kid says\", 'right a million a billion million', \"trillion that's\", '[Laughter]', \"but but there's a lot of configurations\", 'point is the total number of

actually went at that from', 'the DNA configuration uh perspective', 'which I find fascinating because I', 'thought about this like I think', 'everybody thinks like you know could', 'there ever be another me or how many', 'like like what did it take for me to get', 'here and I looked up the average number', 'of viable sperm in an ejaculate which is', 'somewhere around 200 million yeah yeah', 'half a billion typically some somewhere', 'around there or it could be yeah', 'somewhere and that means that for just', 'me and that one', \"batch you're one in 200 million that\", 'alone gives you an idea of just how hard', 'it is uh for a human being to come to', \"existence right and that's another\", 'another angle that probability takes you', 'into yeah the Rarity of who you are as', \"an individual wow yeah so yeah I I don't\", 'Gary did I hit all the points you you', 'were looking for yeah I mean we the', 'thing is if we if we go and do every', 'single one we are going to be here for', 'another day right so Gary where else are', 'we going to take this all right so we', 'look at our our everyday lives and', 'without realizing it we are calculating', \"as we've discussed and it's kind of like\", 'baked into a number of things we are', 'living Our Lives on online some people', 'conduct a whole part of their life', \"online they'll have maybe a dozen 10 or\", 'so online accounts which they manage', 'which means passwords which means', 'protection which means security all', 'those things and the probability of all', 'the bad stuff probability of it being', 'okay so I think what we need to do is', \"speak to someone who's really at that\", 'Cutting Edge of cyber security and for', 'that we have our dear friends at Bit', 'Defender the cyber Security Experts and', \"we have Alex kosoy I do believe that's\", 'how you pronounce it if got it wrong', \"I'll Stand in a corner um he is their\", 'Chief security strategist so this this', \"guy is a guy who doesn't just try and\", 'look after things he will go after botn', 'Nets with Euro or interpole and bring', \"them down they're on a a large scale\", 'level as well as the personal level so', \"there's a whole different range of how\", 'they operate which I think could be very', 'fascinating and add another facet to how', 'probabilities are entwined into our', 'lives yeah because lately when I choose', 'a password it tries to tell me whether', \"it's a good password or a bad password\", \"and presumably there's some risk factor\", 'calculated to assess that otherwise why', 'would it know anything at all like one', 'two three four is a bad', \"password I mean there there's\", 'information that you have right that in', 'the public domain for your birthday', 'maybe the probability of something bad', 'happening is greater so we need to speak', 'to that expert and Neil here is Alex', 'Alex hey welcome to Star Talk hi Neil hi', 'guys thank you you have the bad assest', \"title of anybody ever it's nobody just\", 'made', 'up Chief give me the title again Chief', 'what chief security strategist Chief', 'security strategist we should salute', \"shouldn't\", 'we so Alex let me start with a couple of', 'questions here the word risk is related', 'to probability and statistics people', 'think they understand risk generally', \"they don't or they what they do\", 'understand is not the full story', \"typically but they're making decisions\", 'about their lives about their health', 'their wealth and their Security based on', 'their understanding of risk so Alex in', 'what way does the probability of a Cyber', 'attack fold into your decisions and your', 'job yeah this is uh as you were talking', \"earlier because I've been listening the\", 'the probability of somebody being', \"attacked uh I I would say it's biased uh\", 'from my perspectives is', '100% everybody will be hacked or', 'attacked or scammed scammed at one point', 'or another', 'but we also did a a study a few years', 'back and all the respondents in total', \"like 76% of them said I don't think\", \"somebody will Target me I don't have\", 'enough money why would I be of any', \"interest super false that's not how\", 'things are going in the cyber crime', \"industry they're practically attacking\", \"everybody and it's probability and\", 'present of who actually says and accepts', 'that link and clicks on button and does', \"the next step so I'm pretty sure Gary\", \"Neil Chuck you've been targeted by a\", 'scam at least once in the past two years', 'I put', '$10,000 on that okay yeah of course can', \"I have that $10,000 I've actually\", 'targeted people in scams', \"myself but the thing is there's a\", 'sophistication to the scam because if if', 'someone comes in and this has happened', 'to me they take a very small amount to', \"begin with and if you don't notice it\", 'and let it skip through your bank', 'statement they come back in and go grab', \"no there's a there's a there's an uper\", 'to that so they tell you you can invest', 'in this particular business you put like', 'you know $10 and you receive in return', '$50 and then they tell you if you put', \"more you'll get more so you put 10 grand\", 'nothing comes back how about that wow', \"okay so it's it's a con\", \"game it's not just a a Cyber attack all\", \"in cyber there's somebody has to\", 'communicate with you correct gain your', 'confidence and then so this just another', \"con game then it's a shell game you know\", \"you're moving those shows around there's\", 'a whatever the stone underneath it is it', 'is but all these things happen now in', 'the cyber world so about WhatsApp', 'telegram Instagram Facebook things that', 'you actually uh use every day and these', 'platforms are actually challenging you', 'into spending more and more hours in', 'front of them so when scammer shows up', 'in your platform you you already believe', 'that this has already been vouched it', \"has been like a checked if it's safe or\", 'not so you already have like a 50% bias', 'to to do it right to fall for it so our', 'familiarity with with these platforms', 'with our time spent on on a screen that', 'familiarity breeds the complacency is', \"that what you're saying I'm sorry guys I\", 'hate to interrupt but as you can see I', \"got to answer this call it's potential\", 'spam', \"so how about so you know that's it's\", 'just coming in right now so you know', \"that clearly that's a scam of somebody\", 'trying to get something from me yeah the', 'idea is that when you received like an', \"anonymous call from a number you don't\", \"know or an email from somebody you don't\", \"really know you're like yes probably a\", \"scam I'm going to ignore it like you\", 'have your phone with potential scam but', 'when you receive these ads dur directly', \"to a platform that you trust you've been\", 'using it for years the chances of you uh', \"being biased and inore Neil as you're\", 'saying the probability of being scammed', 'you you pass the bias are so much higher', 'like oh so I received this ad on', 'Instagram to buy a ticket to um some', 'concert okay maybe Taylor Swift because', \"it's super in the news right now and\", \"it's so so much cheaper than the actual\", \"prices and it's on this Instagram or\", \"Facebook or whatever you'll buy it\", \"oh wow and if you read the news it's\", 'about at least a million or more on', 'every concert million dollars yep on', 'every concert for country for Country', \"Concert yeah that's a very good business\", 'y see now a lot of bands a lot of bands', 'use one particular Outlet here we all', 'spend our times doing phds and', 'research so can I ask what why why do', 'they want your emails like I get a lot', 'of emails from I I just delete them', \"because there's either nothing in the\", \"body or it's a link and I'm like okay\", \"everybody who knows me knows I'm not\", 'opening any links so I just I just', 'delete it why would you want to get my', 'email list what you hear people say oh I', \"got hacked don't you know my email list\", 'got hacked what is the value in an email', 'list okay so if I get a single email', 'address okay I can search known', 'databases or passwords associated with', 'that email address oh my God attct', 'companies or other leaked databases okay', 'so I have your email address and now I', 'have a list of passwords that you use on', 'different websites oh what I can go', 'further anyone else scared right', \"now with those passwords dude you're\", \"freaking us Alex you're freaking us out\", 'oh my God Alex this is terrible shut up', \"now I don't want to hear anything more\", \"from you I'd rather live in my\", 'Blissful if you want you can give me', 'your email addresses and I can do the', \"search for you you'll be no no no no no\", \"no you can't You' already said trust me\", 'right now you want my email address he', 'Trust so wait a minute first they get', 'your email then they get the passwords', \"and what else can they do I mean what's\", 'the next step well there are many steps', 'later on because I can uh see if these', 'passwords are still working so getting', 'into your various accounts I can also', 'see if you have the same password to a', \"different email address that I don't\", 'know about like your business email or', 'your Yahoo email that you US 10 years', \"ago and you didn't change a password and\", 'I can see all your previous girlfriend', 'from when you are', '17s how about that there are so many', 'possibilities if you work in a company', 'and uh email and passwords works I can', \"use those to connect to your I don't\", 'know VPN account launch your ransomware', 'attack make some billions out of it okay', 'mental note change all email passwords', 'every password I must change change it', 'every day every day yeah we see hacks we', 'see data leaks and', 'breaches and it seems to be one a week', 'almost um and I know you do these you', 'fight these these Bad actors daily and', 'thank God the people like you are out', 'there but are we not now kind of', 'desensitized and people are to the point', \"where it's going to happen so what the\", 'hell have we lost that sensitivity to', 'the impact that this could make uh yes', 'but not with the right mindset for this', 'conclusion because yes there are news of', 'cyber attacks literally every day so', 'when I wake up and read the news at', 'least one hack per day right so people', \"are reading this and they're like y y y\", \"not going to happen to me that's\", 'unfortunately the the bias and the', 'conclusion of having being Des sensitiv', 'by this news and when it happens and', \"I've been talking to hundreds of victims\", \"they're like I had no idea this is going\", 'to happen to me you know I just came up', \"with an idea that I'm sure somebody else\", \"has had to have but why is isn't there a\", 'service where I', 'subscribe I have a master password but', 'then that service changes my password on', 'a daily basis and all I need to do is', 'have the one password to get into them', \"yes these Services exist they don't\", 'change your password every day because', \"you don't have to do that okay it's\", 'recommended to change your password I', 'would say maybe every three months the', 'password that you use on these accounts', 'but these password managers this is how', \"they're called they will do what so when\", \"you subcribe to a service you don't have\", 'to think about okay what password should', 'I use should it be long short numbers', 'you so these are going to suggest a', \"password they're going to save it for\", \"you you don't even need to know it and\", 'every time you need to log into that', 'service the password manager will fill', 'in the password for you and some of the', 'browsers already have this functionality', \"built in so that's fine there are other\", \"uh dedicated software that they're going\", 'to keep this passwords list super', 'protected with super encryption but yes', 'the idea is that you remember one single', 'master password and everything else is', 'being taken care of because for us every', \"you know regular people let's be honest\", 'okay so now in 2024 we might have an', 'education of this but I bet you we have', 'accounts that have been created in 2010', \"we stopped using them in 2012 they're\", 'still active the passwords are still for', \"I don't know 1 2 3 4 for instance and\", 'there and there is information in there', 'that can still cause us trouble if it', \"goes out oh I I've got a different angle\", 'here if password hacking occurs because', 'someone gets access to a', \"file of previous passwords then they're\", 'not actually decoding your password no', \"they're not actually figuring out your\", 'password from scratch correct so why is', 'there any difference at all between a', 'simple password and a complex password', \"if they're not decoding your password\", 'for its complexity that is correct and', \"that's the other reason why you should\", 'have a complex password because there', 'are different ways into uh finding out a', \"person's password for a particular\", 'account one of them would be you know', 'just brute forcing trying all the', 'passwords another Techni could be', 'password spraying which means trying the', 'most common passwords on a particular', 'account that are known to be used by by', 'people and in many cases this actually', 'function because uh for particular', 'languages statistically people use', \"similar passwords test4 that's quite\", \"similar from one to nine that's quite\", 'similar I know in 2024 sounds stupid', 'even nowadays we find these passwords in', \"reality my password is password don't\", 'never figured that one out yeah yeah', 'yeah somebody like from like a military', 'uh like a highend grade in the military', 'saying that I had a very simple password', 'because I thought they will never try', 'that out considering my job title it was', 'a so do you run algorithms based on the', 'probability of a certain set of', 'characters yeah what you have a language', 'is that right uh not necessarily the', \"probability said it's languages but also\", 'but by by words in that particular', 'language and also there are billions or', 'hundreds of billions of passwords that', 'already are in the public space or in', 'the public domain from previous hacks so', 'you can make a statistics on that you', 'can say hey 20% of the people use this', \"password let's try that on first wow and\", 'chances are to work huh we know', 'probability criminals know probability', 'so they will do their math first damn', 'wow you want to talk about using math', 'for terrible purposes you can use it for', 'many things you know that joke with a a', 'very important mathematician that', 'received the Nobel Prize and he had to', 'fly to get it and he was so afraid to', 'fly because he thought somebody would be', 'with a bomb in the plane and he want to', 'reach the destination but eventually at', 'the event he shows up everybody knew', 'about his his fear so they asked him', 'like Hey we knew your fear about you', 'know a bomb exploding so why are you', 'here how did you come like well I took a', 'bomb with me what were the odds of two', 'bombs being in the same', 'place well you that joke problem you', \"know how old that joke is it's older\", 'than TSA right because yeah exactly', 'before they checked for', \"bomb so Alex um we're in October 2024\", 'right now but last month there was the', 'National Institute of standards and', \"Technology that's the US National\", 'Institute yeah that stated and this was', 'an article that was written in Forbes', 'but complicated passwords can make you', \"less safe yes now we're talking about\", 'how to make complicated different', 'characters and different cases and', 'numbers and all sorts of things but why', 'why now complication is an issue because', \"that otherwise it's password one two3\", 'yeah there are two ways of defining a', 'complicated passwords and one of the way', 'is actually okay the other way is not', 'really that okay so by complicating a', 'password by making it longer with Alpha', 'Characters numbers and everything else', \"that's going to make it that's going to\", 'make the password super hard to remember', \"so unless you're using a password\", \"manager it means that you're going to\", 'have to write it down and so on which', 'basically sets you in the mindset of you', 'know just giving up just giving up', 'putting the same password because it', 'took you so long to create it or just', 'triam them down to make it easier for', 'you however you can make long passwords', 'without doing all these characters', 'unless the the website was or the', 'service forces you to by having a', 'passphrase I went to the moon and back', \"in a car that's pretty safe okay or even\", \"long phrase something that's easier to\", 'remember but I think NS and also our', 'recommendation is to use a password', \"manager that's going to make your life a\", 'whole easier and also use a', 'multiactor identification or two- Factor', 'identification so besides the password', 'you can use something else or even', 'eliminate the password at all you can', \"you can use all these things you're\", 'going to have a better piece of Mind by', 'that yeah in fact I have a couple of', \"websites that don't use passwords ex\", \"send it's two Factor authentication and\", \"don't you love going to those websites\", \"yes it's it's a it's it's beautiful it's\", 'okay so Neil has quite a distinctive', \"voice and he's in the public domain\", 'are we now at the point where we no', 'longer use voice recognition as the', 'password that was like in style for like', 'six months a couple of years ago right', \"we out of that phase because there's\", 'just too much AI come along to to', \"replicate yeah I don't think voice\", 'recognition can be still considered a a', 'way of authentication and even face', \"recognition that's not going to work uh\", 'any longer I was in a meeting with uh', 'with some of my colleagues and one of', 'them was in vacation but he was showing', 'up in the meeting on Zoom it was the', 'fake AI somebody was playing a joke', 'which was uh very nice because uh he', 'seemed a bit younger he probably had', 'photos from a previous training but that', 'was it was scary for us because we know', 'the the possibilities but it was very', 'nice to have wait wait wait wa wait you', 'just said you had a business meeting and', 'someone duped you into thinking an AI', 'version of an attendee yes but it was a', 'colleag it was a colleag however there', 'is yeah yeah yeah it was on purpose we', \"knew what's going on we were just\", 'analyzing it and I was like oh this is', 'so cool he looks so close by but I', 'remember reading an article uh quite', 'last week about a scam in China where', 'somebody paid $55 million because he was', \"in a zoom meeting with uh I don't know\", '13 or 14 other people from the', 'organization his manager CEO CFO', \"everybody was saying it's safe he did it\", 'he was the only real person in there', 'everybody wasse was deep fake oh my God', \"Bond villain Badness that's the level\", \"we're talking that is yeah I have a a\", 'question and plus we got to sort of', 'think of Landing this plane in the old', 'days a computer', 'virus was really just Mischief people', 'just trying to', 'see if they could harass you in one way', \"or another there wasn't much Financial\", 'motive behind it correct and so it was a', 'nuisance now this kind of hacking always', 'seems to have a financial', 'objective what is the', 'total money earned by Bad actors so I', 'would say a total would be what a total', 'last year was $1.5 trillion dollar what', \"there's a t in there oh we're talking\", 'about ransomware and other scamps but', 'these numbers vary I mean if last year', 'was 1.5 this year can easily go to two', \"or three trillion dollars we're talking\", 'about scams to Target consumers right I', \"mean that's that's a national debt for\", 'some countries yes or great like I said', 'these are just money that are earned by', 'cyber criminals these are not money that', 'counting your financial loss as a victim', \"you're a company when you pay that's one\", 'number but you also have a loss in you', 'have a loss of productivity you have a', \"loss of you know yeah so I God I can't\", \"believe I've been telling my son that he\", 'should continue to study to be a', \"biochemist what the heck he's in the\", \"wrong business he's in the wrong\", 'business but I got one other thing I', 'have to like just get clear in my head', 'so that means in your', \"business you're worth $1.5 trillion\", 'dollar to this world if you can prevent', 'that from happen prevent it right okay', \"that's fact one fact two they would\", 'protect everybody which is not the case', \"okay but here's my thing if someone\", 'retains you to protect their', \"organization then they're putting all\", 'their trust in you so maybe the', \"organization won't get hacked but\", \"suppose you get hacked you're a single\", 'point failure of that entire system CU', \"we're all trusting you in this one what\", 'do you call bottleneck y of of trust yes', 'that is called supply chain attack so', \"basically when you're targeting a\", 'customer you can actually Target all the', 'software that they use in their', 'organization so we have a if if we have', \"a vulnerability that's going to affect\", 'most of our customers yes that is a', \"correct statement so now why aren't you\", 'just uh why are you a good guy', 'well you become Dr Evil what what the', 'heck is your problem yes we get that uh', 'we get that questions a lot you know we', 'can make a lot more money on the dark', 'side but then again how will you sleep', 'at night on a very expensive mattress', \"that's how that is correct because I'm\", 'part of a trillion doll industry that I', 'created so Alex your Chief security', 'strategist yes how much of your strategy', 'is oh this is a supply chain', 'we have to get ahead of a story how many', 'stories are you getting ahead of rather', 'than putting out fires oh good point', \"interesting uh I think it's a equal\", 'amount uh I would say because yes there', 'are some situations that you can', 'actually uh prevent because you thought', 'about it you knew that would happen and', 'you make some plan but then by working', 'with your customers and victims and', 'having a lot of conversations with law', \"enforcement they're going to come up\", \"with stories that you were like whoa I'm\", 'an engineer I never thought of that scam', 'so you start to figure out you know what', 'can you build from a technological point', 'of view to prevent that so I would say', \"it's a it's a fair equal amount so you\", 'know what I think we would be remissed', \"if we didn't leave our viewers and\", 'listeners having you at our disposal at', 'least one or two of the top things they',

tell me', \"I'm pretty happy I'm a dinosaur 41 years\", \"so I don't have online all the stupid\", \"I did oh don't post stupid things\", 'that you did exactly oh I got it no no', \"no I don't do that okay and for for\", \"Enterprises there's a wide range of uh\", 'tips and tricks but the idea is that', 'since ransomware is the number one', 'threat right now make sure you have', 'backups and make

they they', 'loved it I could go to college and major', 'in physics or continue with my band oh', 'but do you have that thing like a gap', \"year we call it where you say well I'm\", 'going to take a year off the studies', 'before I go to college or university and', \"so I'd said that I'd said I'm going to\", \"be in this band and and I'm just going\", \"to do it for a year and then I'll go and\", 'do physics H but then we got a record', 'deal uh a big record deal with A&amp;M', \"records this is in 1986 1987 it's a long\", 'time ago got a big record deal and so we', 'we I came to Los Angeles and recorded an', 'album with uh actually produced by Larry', 'kleene who was married to Joanie', 'Mitchell at the time and so we recorded', 'some of it in Janie Mitchell studio in', 'Los Angeles so and then we toured with', 'uh my first professional gig with that', 'band was with Jimmy Page in Jimmy pagee', 'and did you open for Jimmy Page yeah we', 'open for Jimmy pagee and and Gary Moore',

a', 'couple of albums so I did that basically', 'for five years and it charted uh', 'actually no we we just we did Big Shows', 'it was a rock and roll band and then and', 'then we I left that band um

so so so so but you\", 'the give me a more resonant no the very', 'the very', \"strong I suppose I'm trying to find the\", \"right word for it I think it's that's\", \"why I said conviction it's almost I\", \"don't know if any physicists who would\", \"disagree with because if you can't fold\", \"it into the quantum world you don't\", 'really have a right to start looking for', \"a graviton because you're going to say\", 'the graviton is the mediating particle', \"yes so it's the way the photon is the\", \"med particle so and that's um I I think\", \"I don't think you'd find anyone who\", 'would disagree with that statement okay', \"although I don't think you would\", 'although it is true to say that because', 'gravity is so weak so this is the other', 'thing to say it is tremendously weak', 'compared to the other three forces of', 'nature of which electrom magnetism is', \"one here I tell people you've surely\", 'done this in class they say how weak is', 'gravity well I can pick something up off', 'the floor against the wishes of Earth', 'exactly yeah yeah the whole earth is', 'pulling on this ball and I can just pick', 'it up off and and kick kick it and', \"you're using electromagnetism that's\", \"what's happening so your muscles and all\", 'that thing so this is all', 'electromagnetic force which completely', 'destroys as you said the gravitational', 'force um but gravity is only additive so', 'it only adds up in the universe so is a', 'do is the dominant force on Cosmic', \"distance scales that's the point about\", \"gravity here's a calculation I haven't\", 'verified but it sounded legit uh very', 'verifiable I just never I was too lazy', 'that uh if you take like the space', 'shuttle in its Glory Days and you take', 'one remove the electrons from one cubic', 'centimeter in the nose of the main tank', 'and take all those electrons and put it', 'at the base of the Launchpad it could', 'would not be able to launch the', 'attraction between the electrons at the', 'base of the launch pad and the net', 'positive charge at the top right yeah is', 'enough to prevent it from launching yeah', \"that's a cool idea I could see that that\", 'would be yeah yeah actually would yeah', \"borrow a whole so it probably yeah it's\", 'not a realistic experiment but to get', 'some sense of the forces involved yeah', \"that's a really nice okay so gravity is\", 'weak that somehow bails you out of this', 'problem well it just means that you', \"can't we don't have experimental access\", \"to them okay because it's so weak I\", 'agree so whereas we do have experimental', 'access to photons yeah unless you could', 'potentially have access if there were', 'extra dimensions in the universe that', 'are configured in the right way',

yeah I think there I\", 'mean it depends I think it depends what', 'you mean by String Theory I mean there', 'was that if you go back you know a few', 'decades you talk to Brian Green for', 'example

area', \"but it's got much more complicated and\", \"it's been much harder I think the\", 'initial idea that you could just predict', 'everything from one number maybe has', 'gone away one simple

catching me up on this I at this', \"conference you're giving a a talk on\", 'black holes yeah and there was some', 'recent announcement the biggest jet from', 'a black hole ever discovered ever yeah', 'ever uh I I when I was asked about it by', \"the Press I simply said there's always a\", 'biggest jet in the universe and so now', 'this one is that the A380 okay airb A380', \"it's a

it out of the war no he died in', '1916 so shortly after not not in action', 'he not in action okay I think he died', 'from dis diseases that it was on the', 'Russian front okay it was yeah so War', 'related but not I think it was you would', \"argue War related uh yeah so we've got\", 'you know more than a century of', 'mathematical foundation for this yeah', 'and then you go forward to with no data', 'no data no and then then then so it', 'takes another 50 years by the way for', 'someone to work out what it looks like', 'for a spinning one which is Roy Kerr', \"it's a famous ker solution but those two\", \"solutions there they're in Einstein's\", 'theory in some in a sense um and they', 'describe the black ho but um observing', \"them is something that we haven't been\", 'able to do

it's the way the thing is you as\", 'you said right at the start science is', 'about yes having ideas building theories', \"and so on but it's it's really\", 'fundamentally about testing those',

tours Public tours in in in', 'Australia across Europe uh and if I', \"remember correctly you're coming back to\", 'the United States next spring to give a', \"tour across the country yeah yeah it's a\", \"tour that um that that's been going on\", \"for quite a long time it wasn't meant to\", \"really but we've ended\", 'up playing to over 400,000 people across', 'the world with this tour wait wait wait', \"you're not a musician you say playing\", \"get your vocabulary I'm look I'm rock\", 'and roll basically I always been so when', 'when', 'we we have five trucks and two tour', \"buses it's brilliant so I'm reliving My\", 'Life as a so did I see a version of that', 'when you came to the city yeah it was', 'very early on just after it was just', 'after yeah you have these screens that', 'interlock and then the whole stage is is', 'yeah and that was a very early iteration', \"of this and so it's changed a lot before\", 'I laid it to rest this tour and develop', 'another one I wanted to bring it back', 'here in the form that it is now which is', 'so radically different from what and and', \"it's you celebrating the universe with\", 'and for the it is and the public it also', \"morphed into there's a version that I do\", 'with the symphony orchestra which is', 'great fun so we did it at Sydney offer', 'house actually initially um last year', \"and it's a big Orchestra because it's 90\", 'piece Symphony Orchestra because of the', 'music that that I chose and so the The', 'Reason by the way as a slight digression', \"it's part of this tour the classical\", 'music is a big part of the tour so it', \"starts with calus's Fifth Symphony third\", 'movement and that was because a', 'conductor friend of mine called Daniel', 'Harding I said to him what should', 'Stanley cubric have used in 2001 as a', 'joke like what should he have used we', 'immediately said seus Fifth Symphony and', 'it is it was written in 19 uh 15 same', 'year that general relativity was', \"published but it's the basis of almost\", \"every science fiction theme you've ever\", \"heard you hear it's beautiful and and uh\", 'so the idea', \"which I've always strongly believed but\", 'it came to my mind as I was doing this', \"tour is that what what if we're talking\", 'about deeper philosophical questions', 'which are raised by cosmology I say', 'right at the start what does it mean to', 'live a finite fragile life in an', 'infinite Eternal Universe right is it', 'because it and and I say of course I', \"don't know the answer to that do that\", 'uplift people or depress them well but', \"but it's that as you know the moment you\", 'contemplate the Scale of the Universe', \"and I should say we don't know whether\", \"it's infinite we don't know whether it's\", 'Eternal right but but it could well be', 'infinite and eternal for all purposes it', 'kind of is right on a human to a human', 'scale yeah so so the immediately when', 'you contemplate the size and scale of', 'the universe you ask questions about our', 'place and quite vividly what does it', 'mean to live these little finite fragile', 'lives and so I think I try to approach', 'those questions and you realize or I', 'realize that there are other lights you', 'can shine on that problem and science is', 'a necessary bright and Vivid light that', 'casts a very well delineated Shadow', \"which is given us some obviously it's\", 'the framework within which we operate', 'but there are other lights so I you', 'realize that Mara for example so we use', 'Mara in in the classical concerts Mara', 'thought a lot about what it means to', 'live a finite fragile life and he gave a', 'very eloquent answer many eloquent', 'answers in his Symphonies and he was', 'once asked by the way uh what what are', \"you trying to say what what's this\", 'answer and he said well if I if I could', \"say it I would wouldn't have written the\", 'music good answer you have this music', 'love that so so the music so the', 'composers that I chose and that part', \"they are in the the tour that we're\", 'going to do NE this coming year NE next', \"April 2025 um they're in there as music\", 'the the composers were chosen because', 'they explored this question and gave', \"very eloquent answers the the so so it's\", 'it adds to I think the more', 'philosophical exploration of the', 'questions that raised by the signs', \"what's the name of the tour called\", \"Horizons Horizons that's easy enough to\", \"remember okay very cool but there's a\", 'lot of black holes in it as well I', \"should say so it's an exploration of of\", 'the ideas that I find black is a horizon', 'of its own they have Horizons yes but', 'but but also life in the universe the', 'origin evolution of Life speculations on', 'we could talk about speculations on how', 'many civilizations there might be as a', 'guest well this thing about life in the', \"universe you've done many many uh TV\", 'series', 'and most recently one on the solar', 'system yeah where the search for life is', 'a main theme well yeah we just saw as we', 'speak last week the Europa Clipper', 'spacecraft was launched yes on the way', 'to Europa we have an entire show devoted', 'just to that we visited the jet', 'propulsion labs and saw felt the', \"excitement of everyone there it's great\", \"isn't it it's the first spacecraft I've\", 'seen major spacecraft being built so I', 'saw the Clipper and the thing is the', \"scale of that thing it's it's the\", \"largest spacecraft isn't it that's ever\", 'been sent into well if you add the so', \"the most massive here's it may be but\", \"there's another important fact solar\", 'panels have gotten more efficient in the', 'day back if you were going to explore', \"beyond the asteroid belt you couldn't\", 'use solar panels the intensity of the', \"sun wasn't high enough this one has a\", 'very Deployable large solar panel', \"that'll help it along without having to\", 'rely entirely on the on the nuclear', 'Decay PL', \"yeah so it's a huge spacecraft and the\", \"point is that Europa Jupiter's moon is a\", 'prime candidate for for a habitable', 'world in the what we know almost', \"certainly I'm always the people who I\", \"know work on the mission say don't say\", \"we know we we're almost sure there's a\", 'saltwater ocean below the surface I', \"think it's pretty indisputable now so\", \"pretty sure it's there yeah but whatever\", 'is the skepticism what would it be were', \"it not a glal ocean yeah it's very\", \"difficult to because and that's from\", 'many measurements made amonia I mean', \"there's not you know water molecule is\", 'not rare yeah it looks like salt water', 'yeah and and we have a lot of', 'comparative planetology with is it the', 'Arctic when it freezes over you have', 'these chunks of ice that will break and', 'refreeze and readjust and and you can', \"compare the images and you'd think you\", 'were looking at the frozen Arctic yeah', \"yeah so it it looks and there's more\", 'water in that ocean', 'than all the oceans of the earth', 'combined geologically active there are', 'questions about how the ice cracks and', \"moves on the surface so it's a\", \"fascinating Mission so that's Europa\", \"Mars of course which You' probably\", 'spoken about many times on this podcast', \"um Enceladus is another one Saturn's\", 'moon even even out of Pluto I even the', 'ones we see the plumes of of geysers I', 'guess yeah yeah when at the right Sun', 'angle you can see who who took those', 'pictures that must must have been right', \"right right yeah so and also there's\", 'some measurements from Cassini the', 'particles in those Jets of water which', 'are consistent with hydrothermal vent', 'activity on the floors and hydrothermal', 'vents are one of the plausible', 'candidates for the origin of life on', 'Earth yes so you seem to have everything', \"the one thing I think europa's got that\", 'arguably nowhere else has is it looks', 'like that ocean has been there for many', \"billions of years that's the the\", 'Baseline scenario and we evolve life in', 'less time than that here on Earth yeah', 'yeah present what 3.8 billion years ago', '3.8 yeah yeah and the the other four and', 'a half billion years old so right yes so', 'so it looks like you have a habitat', \"that's been stable there and I think you\", \"can't CL that with in fact you know it\", 'was taught that it took about a half a', 'billion years on Earth to get life going', 'but we were able to revise that number', 'down because in the early Earth these', \"periods of heavy bombardment it's not\", \"fair to start the clock while we're\", 'still getting slammed by you know still', 'accreting leftover rocks from the solar', 'system as the temperature of the surface', 'of the Earth is high enough to prevent', 'complex molecules give us a chance', 'please so the the periods of bombardment', 'subside Earth surface cools now start', \"the clock and then it's about 100 100\", \"million years yeah yeah so that's like\", 'that yeah which is one of the reasons I', 'think that I think if you speak to many', 'biologists they would say that might', 'suggest that given the right conditions', 'then whatever the origin of life is', \"there's a reasonable probability given\", 'the right conditions because it happened', 'quickly here right so but that now', \"that's not that's not definitive in any\", 'sense but certainly tempting to go there', 'but then but what I find very', 'interesting then is though when you ask', 'okay but when did life get more complex', \"than a single cell you're you're then I\", \"don't think there's any evidence in the\", 'fossil record back Beyond about 600', 'million years ago that took a while yeah', 'we we as single cell creatures three', 'billion years yeah plus but it seems so', 'I think people who think about this', 'problem are honest about that and so in', 'the search for life on other planets', \"we're really looking for single cell\", 'organism well it would be it would be', 'remarkable to see anything more complex', \"well it' be remarkable to see a single\", 'cell because then you', 'know especially if it were biologically', 'different so you can really show that', \"it's got a different origin because it's\", 'worth saying that on Mars the material', 'is exchanged between Earth and Mars so', \"it's not obvious yeah that you could and\", 'you make all these points in your Series', 'right so where where where can people', \"find your series it's streaming I\", \"presume yeah yeah we've got the new one\", \"is just on the moment actually that's\", \"what I'm saying the solar system so that\", 'will appear on Apple I suppose at some', \"point and other places yeah I mean it's\", \"the moment it's on the BBC so um and\", \"it's streaming on the BBC and then it\", 'will head off around the world one of', 'the coolest things I think about Europa', 'is that the the habitat that the', 'potential habitat requires Jupiter', \"because the the heating it's liquid\", 'because of theing around a big but it', 'also seems to require well it requires', 'the other moons iio and ganim to keep it', 'in this orbital resonance which keeps', 'feeding the energy in from the', 'gravitational field the Family Affair', 'but it also might need the the the', 'material from the volcanoes of IO on the', 'surface of Europa because they might', 'provide the what what we call the', 'oxidant right so that so so life is so', \"you're saying that the an IO which is\", \"badly stressed it's just one big volcano\", 'there one big volcano so th it spews', 'volcanic substance yeah faster than', 'escape velocity apparently and then it', 'goes which lands on on EUR and it it', 'goes into Pathways that intersect other', 'moons Europa included you do this for a', 'billion years and then the', 'chemistry and then it gets iradi helps', 'out the chemistry yeah so we we one of', \"the theories that that I've spoken to\", 'people on the clip emission said is that', \"that's part of the battery of life that\", \"chemistry so life I can't remember who\", 'said it but he said life it was someone', \"said it's life it's an electron looking\", \"for a place to land that's what life is\", \"it's just in one way you can see life is\", 'electrons moving around but that means', 'you need the chemistry but to is that', 'all we are just electrons looking for a', \"place to land well that's that's whatt\", \"I'd rather be Dust in the

also true of\", \"Earth isn't it you you can't understand\", 'Earth without understanding the system', 'the solar system you need to understand', 'the moon and how it stabilizes the spin', 'axis and

every', 'Mission out to the planets we the they', 'looked over their shoulder and found', 'moons which had way more geologic', \"diversity than anything we're finding on\", 'the planet you know I found it', 'interesting because did you I mean when', 'you were in school did where were we pre', \"Voyage well Voyage it so I'm pre Voyager\", 'and Voyager turned the moons into Worlds', \"yeah that's what happened yeah yeah so\", 'the idea you have a habitable zone in a', 'solar system which is the The Zone', 'within which if you have a rocky planet', \"orbiting and everything's right then and\", 'the atmosphere is right you could have', 'the conditions to support life on the', \"surface liquid water let's say and so\", 'and so that turn out to be needlessly', 'limiting well exactly so so so you just', 'say well Mars Earth Venus in our solar', \"system that's it but then you find reh\", 'habitable zones around gas giants that', 'and that as you said that was the great', 'discovery of VO Voyager I would say yeah', 'began with voyager really for sure yeah', \"should be 19 early 1980s right so I'm\", \"I'm delighted even as a particle\", 'physicist you get to also platform the',

only\", 'just a few yeah I thought damn good', \"answer yeah he's I remember Steven Weber\", \"good answer I I think I'm right in\", 'quoting him as saying that he almost', \"wish black holes didn't

still trying to\", 'explore neutrinos and as I understand', \"there's a new nutrino experiment that\", 'just there came online I mean there are', 'several I mean I so the I mean what the',

are made of', \"basically three particles that's us and\", 'electrons protons neutrons uh well no so', 'so the protons and neutrons are made of', \"quarks oh so okay quarks down let let's\", \"start from the we're made of atoms you\", \"can start with we're made of atoms and\", 'we ATS in Greek means indivisible yeah', \"that's what that word means yeah and and\", 'I it is remarkable by the way you say', 'the the Greeks 2,000 years ago uh we', 'only discovered that the structure of', 'atoms in the 20th century or there ads', 'existed well yeah it was up for debates', 'the turn of the 20th century it was one', 'of the debates in science is there such', \"a thing as an atom yeah it's incredible\", 'incredible yeah yeah yeah and Einstein', 'indeed in 1905 one of his famous papers', 'was on brownie in motion which one of', 'the three famous papers in that year one', 'of the other one was special relativity', 'and the other one when he got the Nobel', 'Prize for was the photo electric

the foundation to', 'Quantum Mechanics yeah we we discovered', 'that matters made of atoms and then we', 'very quickly discover after that that', 'the atom is a electrons initially we', 'have this almost solar system like model', \"that it's a a nucleus a dense nucleus\", 'with an electron going around it and', 'then we discover the nucleus is made of', \"protons and neutrons that's 1930s by the\", 'way by orbit model is still the the', 'symbol for an atom yeah you know yeah', \"the atomic because it's classic you know\", \"but that's Adams look nothing like that\", 'no no no and so then quantum mechanics', \"comes in tells you you can't have that\", 'because charged particles moving around', 'in the vicinity of other charged', 'particles radiate energy away and they', \"wouldn't be

I'm\", \"amazed when so much you know we're now\", 'in the', 'Centennial decade of the discovery of', 'quantum physics back in the', '1920s and the whole 1920s was done', 'before we discovered the new', \"that's crazy yeah it's it's it's almost\", 'living it is living memory for some', \"people just about this okay so let's get\", 'back to the fundamental particles then', 'then we discovered that the protons and', 'neutrons are made of quarks quarks so', 'they are as far as we can tell Point', \"like objects so they're fundamental they\", \"won't be but as far as we can tell they\", 'are experimentally so we have the photon', \"the electron well let's the matter\", 'particles so we have so the up and down', 'quarks make up protons and neutrons so', 'proton is is two ups and a down and a', 'neutron is two downs and an up got it', 'and we have two quarks per energy', 'stratum here correct well so then so', 'then we discovered so we had this we', 'have this nice thing so we have the', 'electron as you said the up and down', 'quark and then the thing called the', 'electron', 'neutrino which we so we just talked', 'about NEOS so only four fundamental', 'particles in anything we know or care', \"about so we have four of them yep that's\", 'it and then we have so I can construct', 'you out of these particles if I had the', 'the', 'recip but then so we have four of them', \"so so that's there's four of them and\", 'then the for is that that mediate the', 'interactions right okay and which we can', 'also think of as being carried by', 'particles as we said we have the photon', 'partic the electromagnetic force we have', 'the w and z bosons which do the weak', 'nuclear force and the gluons which the', 'strong nuclear force and stick the', 'quarks name gluons GL okay and and so', \"that's it it seems except that there are\", 'two copies of those that are identical', \"except they're more massive so the so\", \"there's there's the Str the charm and\", 'strange quarks and the muon and the M', \"neutrino that's another family that's\", \"nothing that's the next level up in\", \"energy they're more massive more massive\", 'okay okay so you have the charm and', 'strange and the muan and the Muno and', 'then you have another one yeah which are', 'the bottom and top or sometimes called', 'Beauty and Truth depending on how you', 'want to do it the quarks and then the', \"TOA and the to neutrino and that's it as\", 'far as we can tell so that those are the', 'M 4812 fundamental particles and their', 'antimatter counterparts yeah and then', 'the antimatter counterparts and so that', \"that why we don't know so why there are\", 'three and with with experimentally', 'proven really with some very small', 'caveats only three generations only', 'three families of these things', 'is there reason for there to be only', \"three could there be five 10 so we don't\", 'know it must be something to do with the', 'underlying it looks like a periodic', 'table so remember you go back to men', 'mendal and the periodic table what what', 'how do you understand that pattern in', 'the in the chemical properties of the of', 'the elements you understand it when you', \"know that everything's made of atoms\", 'yeah I mean the chemist arranged it but', \"didn't have any understanding of it no\", 'quantum physics well well you need to', 'know the structure you need to know that', \"there's a nucleus and there's you know\", \"hydrogen's got one electron and helium's\", 'got two and carbon how can we only get', 'you so far yeah so so you you understand',

the', \"underlying Theory which we don't know so\", \"it's one of the great Mysteries so so\", \"this so that's the the the zoo of\", \"particles as we know and then there's\", 'the higs and just to be clear when I', 'attacked Steven Weinberg in the elevator', 'uh most of the particle identities I was', 'referencing are different combinations', 'of different quirks yeah come together', 'yeah so all these like you said in the', 'f50s and people were discovering all', \"these things and they're different\", 'combinations of ups and downs and', 'strange and charm and and and bottom and', 'you know and so on so they exist in our', \"universe but again they're made of the\", 'more', 'fundamental so so basically the these', 'things that the proton and neutron', \"they're kind analogous to an atom in a\", \"way so so they're a thing they're quite\", 'a big things in particle physics and', 'they have an internal structure and and', 'one yeah and one of the things that I', 'was involved in that we did back in', 'Hamburg all those years ago was we were', 'mapping the structure of the proton so', \"we we we're saying what what is in the\", 'proton how does it work maing the', 'interior

we\", 'we we have an idea yeah they they', 'machine in the back', \"yeah no one's ever been deep into a bear\", 'cave to to to deny that story yeah', \"that's true that well actually I might\", 'know

like the rubber bands', \"okay okay all right let's Le to a\", 'positive future Ryan say you are able to', \"induce a state of torper we're in our\", \"spacecraft we're going into planetary\", 'what are the logistics that we will need', 'is it nice cozy bed are you going to be', 'slopping around an amnot', 'fluid what what do we need we need', 'oxygen we need to be consideration the', \"CO2 that we're\", 'expelling hydration all these other', 'things what are the logistics that we', 'need to be coming to terms with yeah I', 'well I need a Temperpedic mattress okay', \"Ryan I'm just letting you know retrofit\", 'the pods with a tempic mattress yeah', \"yeah I've liked watching movies in the\", \"sense of there's a lot of creativity\", 'with what they sort of make these pods', \"look like if you're weightless you won't\", 'need a mattress what point yeah they', \"advertise we're used by M yes they do sp\", 'and you only need it for the eight', \"minutes you're going into right and the\", \"rest of the time you're weightless it\", \"doesn't matter if there's a mattress\", \"there at all that's true because the\", 'depression that is from the takeoff and', \"that's it that's it yeah so what do they\", 'sleep in in space space space', 'space no they have the little sleeping', 'bags that they slide in keeps them warm', 'yeah okay interrupt keeps them from', \"floating around no that's totally fine\", 'yeah especially keeps you from around', \"into somebody else's well to that same\", 'token I think I think someone in a', 'torpid like state in space is going to', 'need some sort of sequestering', 'environment so like a pod kind of like', 'what you would see in the movies and and', 'I would I would say yeah CO2 is probably', 'my main concern when it comes to', 'hibernation once you have that lowered', 'metabolic rate O2 becomes less of a', 'concern obviously you still need it but', \"you don't need as much but CO2 will\", \"still eventually build up so you're\", 'going to have to sequester CO2 away or', 'recycle it into O2 I think that humans', 'are going to need some sort of', 'supportive fluids and and the real', 'question is what what is the hibernation', 'going to look like because in natural', \"hibernation they don't just go into\", 'torper and stay in torper they actually', 'go into torper and they periodically', 'spontaneously come out of torper for', 'about 24 hours and nobody has any idea', 'why and then they go back in and they', 'just repeat that cycle throughout the', \"entire hibernation season it's like us\", 'waking up in the middle of the night', \"exactly what's the timeline on that that\", 'cycle depending on the species so on the', 'on the on the most robust hibernators', \"like the 13 line ground squirrel they'll\", 'stay in that torper period for about', '20ish days', \"and then they'll arouse spontaneously go\", 'into this what we call interbout arousal', \"and they'll stay in that between 12 and\", \"24 hours and then they'll go back into\", 'torper for that about 20 days and when', \"they come out of hibernation that's\", 'actually when they sleep during the', 'hibernation season so they still it', 'seems that they still must sleep like', 'all other mammals so the sleeping which', 'we always heard about as a neurological', \"necessity what you're saying is\", \"whatever's going on in hibernation does\", \"not serve the body's needs that we get\", 'from sleeping precisely interesting so', 'you still have to come out and sleep', 'maybe', 'the cycle of toror for humans might be a', \"little different where we're in toror\", 'for 4 days and then we come out for', 'three days instead of being in for a', 'month and you know is is that figure our', 'formula might be different yeah our', 'formula I think our formula will', 'certainly be different and actually the', 'bear is a prime examp example of why our', \"formula be different Bears don't have\", 'the INB Rosel and so there is some sleep', 'associated with their toror like State', \"and that's why we think it's more of\", 'this Continuum from sleep to deep torper', 'is that bears sort of on the closer to', \"the Sleep side um where they don't need\", 'these INB rles so they must be sleeping', 'in some fashion in their torper', 'hibernation season and so I I suspect', \"humans will fall on that side they'll be\", 'look more like a bear do you participate', \"in the fat bear photo contest I don't\", \"but I and I'm just hearing of this now\", 'so I think I might have', 'to yeah every fall I think it is people', \"put they get you know who whoever's in\", 'the wilderness they get the fattest bear', \"photo they possibly can yeah and there's\", 'some fat ass bears oh they get really', 'big yeah they get oh my God all anost', \"tissue is what they're putting on too\", \"it's all what all fat tissue that's what\", \"they it's all fat so Ryan some point\", \"you're going to want to test on a little\", 'well say little furry creature and set', \"into space tell me it's last I saw your\", 'chest hair you would count as a furry', \"creature yeah um yes however you're not\", 'suggesting you send a big old bear up', 'into', 'space no I I mean in reality that would', 'be the most informative thing to put', 'into space would be the bear because I', \"think that's what human hibernation is\", \"going to look like but I I I don't think\", \"that's ever going to happen in the near\", 'future you imagine it wakes up grumpy', 'yeah imagine dry', 'you know just to for reality check here', 'the only difference between a bear in a', 'cave and a bear in space is that a bear', 'in space is weightless unless the', 'spacecraft spins up and creates', 'artificial gravity If it creates', 'artificial gravity then the difference', 'between a bear in space and a bear in a', 'cave is zero there is no difference', \"other than like there's no salmon\", 'Swimming by right so what are we', 'actually testing for is it just a zero g', 'effect yeah well well so z g and', 'radiation those are the two things that', \"you're really not getting on Earth that\", 'you will be getting in space now this is', 'outside of low earth orbit obviously', 'yeah yeah there radiation again and just', \"for to be clear when you're in low earth\", \"orbit you're still shielded by Earth's\", 'magne field a lot of the high energy Ray', \"W if you're to go to anywhere other than\", 'low earth orbit you have a radiation', 'dose that will matter to you and of', \"course if you're more radiatively\", 'resistant in

them', \"and the ones that didn't survive the\", 'radiative they died the ones that did', 'came to Earth there it is the and and', \"that's your next uh Pixar\", \"movie but space animals here I'd watch\", \"it I'd watch it just to see so Ryan we\", 'got we got to call it quits there but', 'this has been a highly Illuminating', \"conversation I'm delighted to learn that\", 'we got top people

a pleasure my', 'friend all right Chucky baby you know it', 'Neil degrass Tyson here closing out yet', 'another edition of Star Talk special', 'edition this one on hibernating in space', 'as always I bid you to keep looking up', '[Music]', 'When we say what does geoeng engineering', 'mean? This would be the first time we', 'consciously decide to globally affect', 'climate to our benefit. Engineering on', \"purpose, right? You're talking about the\", \"radiation that's coming in and\", 'greenhouse gas is trapped. It literally', \"becomes kind of a a bounce board. It's\", \"called science. Yeah. It's so cool,\", \"isn't it? It's pretty cool.\", '[Music]', 'This is Star Talk.

My co-host Gary here. How you', \"doing, man? I'm good. All right. You're\", 'looking in good shape. Um, breathing in', \"as we've discussed. Breathing in. It's\", \"the breathing out I'm not doing.\", 'Yes or no? Welcome back as my co-host.', 'Pleasure. All right. So, Gary, what did', 'you say? All right. So, the annual Isaac', 'Azimoff Memorial Debate takes place here', 'in the Hayden Planetarium and this year', 'in 2025, it is geoengineering the pros', 'and the cons. Um, seen by many as', \"controversial. It's an approach to\", 'solving solving global warming, but', 'there are others see it as potential as', 'very very effective. There are a number', 'of different options up for', 'consideration, but uh with them come not', 'just scientific issues, but ethical', 'considerations as well. So, pre-debate,', 'we kidnapped two of the panelists.', \"Sorry. And we've dragged them, locked\", \"them in the office, and we're going to\", \"have our own debate cuz we couldn't wait\", 'until this evening. So, uh did they did', 'they come willingly help? Of course.', \"He's still in a box. Who we have here?\", 'Danielle Vision. Danielle, welcome to', 'Star Talk. Thank you, Neil. Thank you.', 'Yeah. Let me get a little bit of your', 'bio here. Assistant professor in the', 'department of earth and atmospheric', 'science at Cornell. Thanks for coming', 'down state to join us here. Is it still', 'snowing in Cornell? It snows there all', 'the time. It is. Yes, it does. Yes, it', 'is. And it does. Yeah, we get it. Uh', \"you're a climate scientist specializing\", 'in this cottage industry of people who', 'care about stratospheric aerosols', 'and their behavior. Oo. whether they', 'misbehave or behave as you intend.', \"That's that's your whole Let's find out.\", \"And you're also a specialist in what\", \"they're calling climate intervention\", 'methods and what its impact would be on', 'the climate, on ecosystems, and even on', 'culture, societies.', \"So, I mean, what a damn that's a very\", 'high responsibility.', \"Yeah, it is. In other words, don't mess\", 'up. Yeah. If I lining up every lapel to', \"say don't mess this up I you know so who\", 'had the idea that this is a thing that', 'would work people have been discussing', 'it for decades I would say some people', 'point to Edward Teller actually being', 'the first one discussing teller of the', 'Hbomb fame indeed or infamy um right', 'people had discussion about could we', 'fundamentally deliberately alter climate', 'for a long time right as for as long as', 'we understood what climate my weather', 'machine. I will one day rule the world.', 'Yeah. Yeah. No indeed. So it was it is', 'in a way one could say nothing new', 'except then as the problem of global', 'warming of climate change became more', 'and more preminent more and more', 'scientists started thinking about this', \"maybe a bit more deeply. So it wasn't\", 'just a fringe idea. It was a fringe idea', 'in the sense that a lot of people no', 'initially but now no longer fringe. Many', 'would still consider it fringe or at', 'least would like not to talk about it', \"too much. That's different. Okay. Okay.\", 'In that fringe in that sense as I would', 'say that the scientific basis is as well', 'established as for most of climate', 'science but the most of the issues being', 'in sort of the ethical societal', 'dimension bring this topic into a', 'different light. So as I understood from', 'my bit of reading here, you had some', 'prior awareness and understanding of', 'this problem or this solution with', 'volcanoes. Mhm. Because they they pump', 'all manner of nastiness. Yeah. Nastiness', 'into the atmosphere. Nasty. Nastiness.', 'Into the atmosphere. And you get to', \"study that. That's nature doing it. And\", 'so what have you found from the history', 'of volcanoes? Yeah. So the interesting', 'thing is that it was Benjamin Franklin,', 'one of the first Everybody loves Ben.', 'Yeah. And he was a great scientist too.', 'He was the first person to point out', 'that potentially the weirdness in', 'climate that people had seen in the', 'early 19th century were due to the', 'Tambbora eruption, a volcano in', 'Indonesia exploding in 1815.', \"Okay. So he's around of course at that\", 'time. Just remind me, I think Indonesia', \"also has Crakatoa. I mean, there's no\", \"shortage of volcanic. There's plenty of\", 'volcanoes in the tropical band. Yes.', 'Yes. Close to the equator. And sometimes', 'they just go off. They explode. Yeah.', 'And you get to see which way the ejector', 'goes. Like it goes west to east, right?', 'Following prevailing air currents. So', 'people get to study this. And he was', 'clever enough to connect the dots', 'between odd weather and an odd', 'atmospheric phenomenon, a volcano. Okay.', 'So this is some of your foundational', 'background for how you go forward from', 'that. Yes. In the 20th century then', 'there were at least three different', 'volcanic eruptions. Not as big as', 'Tambora but still big enough. The last', 'one being Pinatubo in 1991. And you know', 'I was observing at a', 'telescope and when Pinatubo went off it', 'changed the optical properties of the', 'atmosphere. We had to redo all of our', 'data. Pissed me off.', \"It's not all about you. Not not your\", 'favorite volcano, I assume. Cuz I was at', 'the telescope when the stuff came by,', 'right? Not when it went off, but it took', 'a while took a while. Once again,', 'scientists taking their cue from mother', \"nature. And I don't mean that\", \"sarcastically. It's a fact. No, it's\", \"great. Yes. So with putting it's sulfate\", 'aerosol. What? Tell me what what is an', 'aerosol? Okay. So by aerosol us climate', 'scientists define just every kind of', 'solid or liquid particle suspended in', 'air. The suspended part that makes it an', 'aerosol. Yes. The suspended part. Yes.', 'Yes. Okay. This that the fact that it', 'can be suspended at all makes it an', 'aerosol no matter what it is like SARS', \"KV2. Mhm. You see that that's a very\", 'interesting thing. There were there were', 'a lot of discussion about what', 'constituted an aerosol when it came to', 'the discussion around COVID because', 'there were different definition between', 'what climate scientists consider an', 'aerosol. These very tiny particles', 'submicron scale they float around for a', 'long whileic droplet is a millionth of a', 'meter. So very small very small. So', \"gravity doesn't really do much.\", 'Turbulence actually keeps them afloat.', 'and the very large droplets like the one', 'like spit that medical practitioners', 'consider aerosol aerosol. Right? So', 'there was this was a lot of the', 'confusion at the beginning around around', 'airborne two slightly different usages', 'of the term like the term of the same', 'term same term to get to reducing mean', 'temperatures here on earth. What science', 'do those aerosols have to perform? By', 'mean temperatures you mean average mean.', 'These are the temperatures that make fun', \"of the lower temperatures. They're mean\", \"temperatures. They're pissed off\", 'temperatures. There you go. Okay, go. So', 'the aerosols we we think about again', \"submicron scale that's ends up being the\", 'same size of the wavelength of most of', 'the visible light that we get. Oh, so', 'they are at the specific size where they', 'really interact a lot with incoming', \"sunlight. That's wild. So it's\", \"photochemical. It's actual more like\", \"geometric. No, it's a physical block.\", \"There's also some chemistry but mainly\", 'all of the aerosols that are around that', 'size will reflect will interact with', 'solar radiation through me scattering uh', 'through various scattering processes and', 'scattering this MIE scattering. So', \"that's a simple scattering where the\", 'wavelength of the light matches the', 'particle and then it redirects it', 'because it goes off. But we have like', 'scattering is a different kind of', 'scatter that gives us the blue sky. the', \"blue sky. That's very much a whole\", \"episode. That's for light. Yes, that was\", 'great. By the way, that makes so much', \"sense because what's you're talking\", \"about the radiation that's coming in and\", 'greenhouse gas is primarily carbon as', 'trapped. Carbon dioxide, sorry, is', 'trapped because when the ground radiates', \"heat, it's the atmosphere that's\", 'trapping a different wavelength.', 'Correct. Completely right. Infrareds.', \"Infrareds. Right. So, that's so wild. It\", 'it it literally becomes kind of a a', \"bounce board. It's called science. Yeah.\", \"It's so cool, isn't it? It's pretty\", \"cool. How about that? I'm just saying.\", 'You can still call it wild, but at the', \"end of the day, it's science. So, for\", 'this process to be successful to the', 'level that we would all want it to be', 'successful, how much aerosols do you', 'have to put into the stratosphere? How', 'long is it there? I mean, who gets to', 'argue over where you put them? Does it', 'matter then on seasonality and what have', 'we learned from volcanoes about where it', 'goes, right? And if I remember', \"correctly, I think it was the late ' 80s\", 'where there was there was talk of', 'nuclear winter where a total nuclear', 'exchange would burn forest, put I guess', 'aerosols in the atmosphere, blocking', 'sunlight, plunging all the earth into', 'darkness and cold into so that would be', \"a bad effect of it, but now you're\", 'trying to make it a good effect. Mhm.', 'So, let me I all great questions, but', 'they can all and it can also all be', 'connected, right? So, aerosols, we', 'already have aerosols all around us,', 'right? Most of the pollution, the haze', \"that you see in New York City, that's\", 'pollution. Those are aerosols, right?', \"But it makes for a lovely sunset. Let's\", \"be real. Makes a lovely sunset. It's\", 'super bad for your health. When you when', 'you burn fossil fuels, you burn coal,', 'you produce these aerosols that are', 'super bad for your health. And once they', \"has never been worse, it's a beautiful\", 'sunset. Wait for this. I want to hear', \"this. I need to I'm just trying to\", 'think. So they come down and they come', 'down mostly we burn them very close to', 'where we live. They stay in the air but', 'they are below the clouds. So whenever', \"then there's rain they just get washed\", 'out away. Right. So actually currently', 'we just to be clear a raindrop forms on', 'these particles absorbs the not as much', 'for sulfate. Sulfate is actually not a', 'as well as good as a cloud nuclei as', 'other kind of particles. Not all not all', 'aerosol particles. But when they say', 'something things rain out, they', 'typically mean that the droplet formed', 'on these particles. No, it can also mean', 'that the droplet while falling absorbs', \"these tinier particles. That's called\", \"wet deposition or wash out of our What's\", 'the real term? Uh wet', 'deposition. Wash out. I love that. Yeah.', 'So normally we emit as humans just as', 'pollution over a 100red million tons of', 'sulfur dioxide which is the precursor of', 'all sulfate aerosols uh per year 100', \"million tons it's a lot and most of that\", 'falls down close to where we live right', 'acid rain people who are alive in the', '80s not me but people who are alive in', 'the 80s will remember acid rain never', 'because wait just so I get my chemistry', 'remember my chemistry sulfur dioxide is', 'not itself acid but if combine with a', 'hydrogen you get hydro', 'H2SO4 which is itself sulfuric acid and', 'that would be the acid range. SO2 gets', 'oxidized by O the radical O which is', 'present everywhere in the atmosphere and', 'this then eventually results another', 'three reactions and results SO3 and then', \"H2SO4 got and then this H2SO4 it's in\", 'vapor form sulfuric acid and then tends', 'to nucleate into sulfuric acid particles', 'liquid aerosol droplet acid rain. Yep.', 'and as it rained. So back in the 80s,', 'the US was emitting way more sulfur than', 'it is now. And so the global emissions', 'were 160 million, 150 million tons. Now', \"we're getting the US has been going down\", 'for a while. Europe as well, China and', 'India have been going up, but in', \"general, we're still around 100 million\", 'tons. These aerosol particles do have a', 'cooling effect. We know this. The IPCC,', 'the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate', 'Change, has known these for a while.', 'They do cover up a small fraction of the', 'warming produced by the greenhouse', \"gases. What you're saying is our effort\", 'to clean up the air has taken these', 'particles out', 'and', 'thereby increased the effects of global', 'warming. Unmasked. It has unmasked', \"unmasked. That's the word that that\", \"normally it's used. It has unmasked part\", 'of the global warming that before was', 'sort of hidden. So, and this is the', 'other part of the observation, right?', 'You need but to do this masking close to', 'the surface, you need hundreds of', 'millions of tons because these aerosols', 'stay just a couple of days. Mhm. Okay.', 'So, the idea behind something like', 'stratospheric aerosol injection is what', 'if you could put a tiny fraction of', 'these aerosols, they would stay though', 'for 100 times longer than they do at the', 'surface before falling down, right?', 'Months up to a year. Essentially, you', 'would get more bangs for your buck,', 'right? with just a smaller fraction you', 'would get the same amount of cooling but', 'far away from where people live and', 'breathe and you could get the same', 'effect while not pushing pull. So what', \"what's what makes the stratosphere\", 'special for how long something would', \"last there? Is it because we're not\", \"making clouds there? Right. So there's\", \"no clouds, there's no water vapor. The\", \"stratosphere is very dry. So there's no\", \"rain out. But also the troposphere, it's\", \"called troposphere because it's\", 'turbulent, right? Because there are', 'turbulent the where we live, right?', 'where where airplanes are above the', \"troposphere there's a stratosphere that\", \"is called like that because it's very\", \"stratified things there's no turbulence\", 'things move very slowly so once you I', 'never thought about that because if you', \"have turbulence it's turbulence up and\", \"down and if you're up and down\", \"turbulence it's not stratified so that's\", 'why you call it stratosphere very good', 'thank you and so once you put in Italian', 'what is is it', 'stratosphera I knew it would be a cool', \"word stratosphere Well, that's where it\", \"comes from, right? Yes. Yes. It's that\", 'the original', 'Latinop Latin root. So, yeah, once you', 'put something especially in the tropical', \"stratosphere, that's where there is the\", 'large scale what we call the breer doson', \"circulation. It's essentially this large\", 'scale stratospheric circulation that', 'push thing pushes things up close to the', 'tropics and then pushes them pole wward.', 'So eventually the air that is in the', 'stratosphere goes back down but close to', 'the pole and it takes a year a year and', 'a half before a parcel of air that', 'originates or of any material that is in', 'the stratosphere goes all the way gets', 'removed from the stratosphere. Got it.', 'And you get a good spreading of the', 'effect. that too because right because', 'the other thing is that both on a', 'latitude but even more importantly on a', 'longitudinal way as in once if you put', 'and this is another one thing that makes', 'stratospheric aerosol injection complex', 'from a political point of view is that', \"you can't put these aerosols on top of\", \"the US and they're not going to stay\", \"there. They're going to spread\", 'throughout definitely the whole', 'latitudinal band. So China which is on', 'the same latitude as the US or Europe', \"they're all these aerosols are going to\", 'in a week. So longitudinally the winds', 'are very fast and so it in a week or two', \"there's a complete spread and we see\", 'that with volcanoes all the time. Small', 'volcanic plumes spread in a couple of', \"weeks throughout the whole that's how I\", 'know cuz I was in the Chilean Andes and', 'the Pinatubo was east of us that just', 'came due west just messed all to mess', 'you up mess mess me up. So when we had', 'that explosion in Iceland it brought', 'civil aviation to the ground. test to', 'see if he can pronounce the name of that', 'volcano. What was the name of that', 'volcano in Iceland? Everybody calls it a', 'a uh I have a lot of volcan', 'volcanologist. They just call it You got', \"the answer you deserved. That's the\", 'answer I deserve. But that stopped air', 'traffic in and out of Heathrow and', 'everywhere in Europe. Yeah. But that was', 'not the sulfate because So do do we have', \"a potential issue because you say it's\", 'going to sit above this area of', 'commercial airflight. Will it not', 'descend? So two things. So volcanoes', 'explode all the times and when they', 'explode the main thing they do the', 'short-term larger effect is the ash.', \"Right. Right. So that's the thing that\", 'is very dangerous for aviation because', 'when ash interacts with the with the', 'aircraft it can up everything right. It', 'can glassify and so it can be a real', 'danger. Some volcanoes. Did you say', \"glassify? I think so. And I'm not sure\", \"whether that's an actual scientific term\", \"but let's pretend it is. I love that. So\", 'this is the ash getting heated in the', 'engine, right? Turning into glass.', \"Glass. But wasn't it already heated in\", 'the volcano? Right. But then it cools', 'down pretty quickly and so the ash', 'actually forms that way and then it can', 'sort of undergo So the ash is pretty', 'okay. So when people get buried in ash', 'like they did in Pompei. No, no. Uh no.', 'Pompei was not ash. Eolano was ash.', 'Okay. Pompei was a was just a magma.', 'Yeah. The lava was a magma flow. It it', 'was a actually a mud flow really. Oh,', \"that's right. That's why everything was\", \"preserved. Preserved, right? That's\", \"right. That's right. It was mud flow.\", \"Yeah. So, I hadn't fully appreciated\", 'what the ash was and what it can be at', 'its worst. Yeah. So, the this ash is the', 'first thing the thing you actually see.', \"You don't really see the sulfate, right?\", \"But it's the thing that is dangerous\", 'over a one, two days time scale a week,', 'right? Also, because this ash is also', 'very tiny and so you can breathe in.', \"It's very dangerous and so on and it's\", 'dangerous for aviation. Some volcanic', 'eruptions also have what for climate', 'scientists is a lot of sulfate. Not all', 'volcanic eruptions also launch sulfate', 'in the atmosphere. For instance, Hunga', 'Tonga that happened in 2022 was a huge', 'volcanic eruption. There was almost no', 'sulfate. It was just water vapor pushed', 'up from from the ocean, but there was', 'almost no sulfate. Hunga Tonga had', 'something like 300,000 tons of sulfate.', 'Pinatubo had 17 million tons of sulfate', 'in a couple of hours. And how much does', 'a kuna matata have?', 'Um, I would have to go back and check my', \"numbers. I don't know. Good question.\", \"So, we're putting aerosols into the\", \"stratosphere and we've got the the\", 'natural cycle Mhm. of the the wind', 'systems. How do you discuss this with', 'sovereign nations and and they say,', '\"Well, I don\\'t want that flying over my', 'territory.\" who then owns the territory', 'above particular country. Do you have to', 'find your counterpart in every country', 'so that they can speak to their', 'governments to come to an agreement on', \"this? That's definitely what we do as\", 'scientists. Yes, I constantly talk and', 'work with climate scientists from all', 'over the world. Um, for sure. For your', 'question though, I would say nobody', 'knows who the stratosphere belongs to.', 'The stratosphere of all places is', 'actually one of the least regulated. Uh', 'we know air airspace is in the', 'troposphere and so we know how what', \"who's who's liable for things that\", 'happen in the troposphere and then', \"there's space and some other treaties\", 'regulating that but nobody really had to', 'regulate the stratosphere for a long', 'time. The only treaty that exists is the', 'Montreal protocol for the for substances', 'that affect stratospheric ozone which', 'protects us from damaging ultraviolet', 'light. But that whole protocol was just', 'for the ozone. Just for the ozone. It', 'was just for the ozone. And a couple of', 'years ago there was an increase in one', 'of these ozone depleting substances that', 'was not predicted was not expected and', 'it took countries a year to figure out', 'from which country this depleting', 'substance this increasing depleting', 'substance was coming from. But even then', 'the hanging who which country was it?', 'Well it was a country in Asia. Okay.', 'Okay. uh even you see interesting thing', 'was that the agency the US scientific', 'agency that found out about where this', \"uh product was coming from couldn't just\", 'point the finger and say this is coming', 'from you right they could say we think', 'that this increase is coming from this', 'region of the world but there was no', 'there is no enforcement mechanism even', 'in the mon protocol uh that could say oh', 'you have to stop I mean they the country', 'voluntarily agreed to stop right so a', 'lot of these international treaties', \"don't really have enforcement mechanisms\", \"for the Montreal Protocol. It's all a\", 'matter of all countries agreeing that', 'ozone is important and it should be', 'protected. I think more countries signed', 'that than any other treaty ever. It is', 'the most successful climate and', 'environmental protection treaty in the', 'world. Yeah. Every country signed it', 'because every country realized how', 'important it was to have an ozone year.', 'Yeah. So, Chuck, you missed it. Yeah.', 'Okay. It was a cosmic phenomenon that', 'affect mostly white people and so they', 'acted', 'they that is surprisingly correct. But', 'yeah,', 'what does it take to motivate the', 'powerful countries of the world? Yeah.', 'Just say not get their tan. If their tan', \"is at risk, you're going to lose the\", 'beaches. Yeah.', 'So what could the stress aerosols', 'achieve? So first of all very clear', 'these aerosols cannot solve climate', 'change. Climate change is a whole other', 'problem. It comes from the greenhouse', \"gases that we have in it's a band-aid\", \"say it's a band-aid. It's a stop gap.\", \"You can call it however you want. It's\", 'something you know some people', \"dismissively say well it's like taking\", \"an aspirin if you have cancer. It's not\", 'treating the underlying causes but even', \"if you have cancer you're the right to a\", 'dignified life and not to suffer from', 'other pains, right? And so in a way is a', 'band-aid in the sense that yes it could', 'help temperature from going up right it', 'could prevent further warming and this', 'way could reduce some of the risks that', 'come from this warming that we know are', 'going to come from this warming and that', 'we already observing are coming with the', 'warming that we see now. So a couple', 'questions fast ones. Mhm. Climate seems', 'to me even as an astrophysicist to be an', 'immensely complex problem to solve given', 'all the variables given the turbulence', 'in an atmosphere with gas and different', 'gas species and the interaction of the', 'atmosphere with the ocean and the land', 'all of this. So is', 'AI helping you in any of this? We are', 'definitely exploring a lot of ways in', 'which AI could help reading the the huge', 'amount of data that we already have.

So then here's a risk that I\", 'learned about and I just want to know is', 'it authentic and is it the worst thing', 'to worry about? If the temperature', 'starts rising and you say we need more', 'aerosols and so you got this these two', 'competing forces you get to tamp it down', \"then there's a terrorist attack on the\", 'people putting up the aerosols.

That's a great question and I would\", 'say it is something to worry about', 'except I would say it would not be', 'instantaneous if you stopped putting', 'since these aerosols stay for so long.', 'If you stop putting them for a day, a', 'week, a month, nothing really changes', 'because the aerosols stay on for a long', 'time.

I\", \"don't think I do not think we should\", 'make plans out of desperation. Okay.

We spent a few billions', \"trying to start them. We'll see if they\", \"still it's still a nent. Yeah, very much\", 'nent. Okay. Are they better than trees', \"at capturing goods? That's a very good\", 'question. I love that. Yeah, I mean', 'trees are great for a whole bunch of', 'reasons.

Stop eating\", 'and heating. Eating and heating. Let it', 'go. So, I get many of the land solutions', 'to this, but how about ocean solutions?', 'Other than CO2 just getting absorbed', 'into the water, surely there are', 'creatures out there that would value', \"some uptake in CO2. If you're talking\", 'about the whale concept, that one might', 'not scale to the levels we need it to.', \"But if you're talking about plankton on\", 'the other hand, that seems more', 'promising. These are really early stages', 'of research, though. But the theory', 'seems really positive. So you how does', \"it work? What's the procedure?\", 'Basically, the concept of ocean iron', 'fertilization would be to add nutrients', 'to the ocean to create a big plankton', 'bloom. The plankton falls down to the', 'bottom of the ocean. What do plankton', 'blooms have anything to do with CO2? Or', 'are these the photosynthetic plankton?', 'Yeah. Yeah. Oh, like a tree. Yeah. Yeah,', 'like a doing what a plant would do,', 'right? Yeah, exactly. Oh, okay. The', 'light bulb went on. Yeah. Thank you.', \"Thank you. So, it's an LED light bulb.\", 'I would expect nothing. Thank you. So,', \"you're growing plankton in the presence\", 'of the CO2. No differently how you would', 'grow trees in the presence of CO2.', 'Except oceans are huge. So, what happens', 'when the plankton die and then they fall', 'to the bottom? Then what? I mean ideally', 'that CO2 would stay at the bottom but', 'that this is the issue with this', 'category of approaches is that the', 'science is really early and the science', 'is expensive right because you need', 'ocean chartered vehicles going out there', \"doing experiments and we just haven't\", \"really begun that process it's not a\", 'laboratory but the potential for this', 'sink and die of the phytolankton is', 'capturing massive amounts of CO2 but', 'surely that has some toxicity in in the', 'ecosystem. Yeah. What does it do with', \"oxygen, right? Exactly. There's little\", 'creatures down there that they do', 'matter. I care about them. What was the', 'little microscopic creature that was', 'here that put all the oxygen in the air?', 'Oh, yeah. Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria,', 'right? Yeah. So, there are consequences', 'that happen when you do this kind of', 'stuff. Yeah. But they would absorb CO2', \"and release oxygen. So, what what's so\", 'bad about that? I mean, for ocean life,', 'what do you have against oxygen?', 'What kind of what kind of a person are', 'you?', \"Remember, I'm a sociologist. Okay, now\", 'we get it.', \"No, it's it's this lack of joined up\", \"thinking that's got us in this situation\", \"in the first place. So, surely we've got\", 'to look at the effect of every living', 'thing in any environment we go into. But', 'the problem is we need to explore. We', \"need to research further. And it doesn't\", \"look as if there's a desire or possibly\", 'the finances to do it. Or am I wrong?', \"It's just short of what's needed to\", 'really get into some of these questions.', \"All right. So if if you're not a\", \"sociologist of plankton, you'd be a\", 'sociologist of people. So how do the', 'effects of all these efforts land', 'differently ac around the world either', 'economically or geographically? Well,', 'the rest of the world is ripping us off.', \"That's the first thing. And it's time\", 'for us to make sure that we have', 'dominance.

So, but there are', 'countries who have nowhere near the', 'resources to participate in this. So,', 'they would be passive observers,', 'possibly even victims of our efforts or', 'our folly. And oddly enough, those', 'countries are far more amendable to the', 'solutions that we need to enact in order', 'to solve this problem.

I mean I think the first', 'step is just to involve more people in', 'the conversation. Okay. And that can be', 'done a lot of ways. It hardly ever', 'happens. You need agencies or', \"organizations that'll do that. Yeah. You\", 'need actually dedicated staff to work on', \"it. It's a big challenge.

the time', 'delay is much much greater we have to', \"factor that in to what we're saying\", 'about what we think is happening now', 'versus whatever it once happen but also', 'we are seeing the',

there's a fun story about the the\", 'discovery of infrared all right which is', 'just outside of the red it was William', 'herel mhm he after Newton had laid down', 'the Spectrum red orange yellow green', 'blue violet he asked the question and', 'this is this is what separates great', 'minds from like everybody else he', 'wondered if each color had a different', 'temperature so he took a thermometer and', 'put it in he had a prism and the light', \"coming through and there's like the\", 'Rainbow on the table and he put the', 'thermometer in in each color but you', 'need a control thermometer right cuz you', \"don't you you don't know if what's\", 'happening to that thermometer is also', 'happening just in the ambient air so he', 'put a thermometer to the side of the', 'spectrum where there was no light just', \"off to the red there's nothing there\", 'puts a thermometer there and then he', 'goes to to check and to compare and he', 'discovers that the hottest thermometer', 'was the one where there was no light', 'coming in and 100 thermometers later', 'and so is it is it a mistake is it a and', 'he concluded that the sun because that', 'was sunlight coming through the prism', 'must be emitting light quote unfit for', 'vision that was his the first', 'description of the discovery of', 'infrared infrared light more on infrared', \"later but we can't see infrared light we\", \"can't more on this so our atmosphere is\", \"trans par to visible light mm and what's\", 'the best evidence of that what do you', 'think I think uh the fact that uh it uh', 'we see the sun yes yes good I was going', 'out on the limb guys good one Chuck yeah', 'in broad daylight you can see the sun', 'yeah exactly we see visible light right', 'and it comes comes through the', 'atmosphere but that atmosphere is not', 'good for other bands so what what are', 'challenges we have and how do we', 'overcome it right so like Earth has this', 'super protective layer thankfully for us', 'right right but that means x-ray light', \"can't get down here that means uh\", 'ultraviolet radiation only some can get', \"down here right so there's all of these\", 'things that we have to do we have to', \"launch telescopes up space above Earth's\", 'atmosphere above the atmosphere', 'absorbing layers yep okay and of all of', \"the bands that don't make it through\", 'visible light makes it through we are', \"sensitive to visible light so it's a\", 'nice matchup it we evolved under this', 'star the sun under this atmosphere of', 'Earth exactly it would be cruel if we', 'were sensitive to like microwaves or', \"something and nothing came in in mic we'\", 'just be blind is that the reason why our', \"eyes suck it's more reasons why our eyes\", 'suck so so the Hubble telescope is one', 'of the great observatories y that was', 'launched above and that saw what kind of', 'light mostly Optical but also a little', 'infrared and a little bit ultraviolet', 'okay and the Hubble we all remember the', \"Hubble telescope it's still up launched\", \"in the early '90s yep and it was Stupify\", 'I remember just losing my breath every', 'time I saw one of the images that was', 'published and we have one of the early', 'ones here what can you tell us about', 'this the Hubble Deep fields and what', \"this is so beautiful it's because they\", \"didn't really think anything was there\", 'right they pointed the telescope at it', 'for a period of time wanting to see what', 'would happen a blank part of the sky a', 'blank part of the sky not knowing that', \"this was what they'd get and it's just\", 'teaming with all of this stuff right all', 'of these galaxies that are far far away', \"and it's just a whole other glimpse into\", 'our universe that we had never had', 'before Hubble it really set the stage in', 'fact that observing effort would have', 'never made it through the telescope', 'allocation committee oh right which is', 'lot of those things right you need to', 'have time for play right right right the', \"ciity of just let's just look up exctly\", \"and see what's there see what happens\", 'yeah if you if you apply I want to find', 'an empty spot at the sky and just stare', \"at it what I can do that I don't no I\", \"don't really need a grant or government\", 'permission right right and so so this', 'was done by the director of The', 'Observatory who and we with our', 'foresight each director has I forgot it', \"was it 10% 15 there's some percent of\", 'the total allocated time called', \"director's discretionary time the\", 'director can just do whatever he wants', \"do whatever the director wants 15% it's\", 'just something 10 but yeah something it', 'depends a lot though when you think', 'about limited the time of a telescope', 'but it paved the way cuz now other', 'telescopes do that same thing knowing', \"that they'll be rewarded it set the\", \"stage other and and it's not just what\", 'the director wants the director might', 'see a proposal that is a little risky', \"but everyone thinks it's too risky this\", \"say let's do it yep so they can pick\", \"other people's research resarch yeah\", \"yeah yeah and that's what made that that\", 'image who was do we know that who who is', 'this cuzz let me tell you something that', 'guy has', \"coones because you're like I mean just\", \"think of it he's like this okay I want\", 'to take the telescope and I would like', 'to look at nothing yes exactly the most', 'powerful', 'TC subscribed by a lot like everybody', 'wants to use Hubble right and so to take', 'the time to look at nothing nothing and', 'to turn it into something yeah but that', 'like poetry there RIS the gamble that', 'this cuz he would be known right now if', 'we were looking at a blank screen as the', 'dumbest man at NASA ever right right', 'right but this came up and just as a', 'reminder nearly everything on this image', 'is an entire galaxy outside of the Milky', \"Way there's a couple of stars those have\", 'the little spiky the spiky features uh', 'but in the Hubble Deep Deep Field forgot', \"how long the exposure was but it's\", 'seeing galaxies way out to the edge of', 'the universe we were happy with that', 'until what well I would say until', 'chander came along and did it two and', 'then the James web Space Telescope came', 'Jam space', \"okay so let's compare what Hubble sees\", 'with James Webb and one of the most', 'iconic images was the Eagle Nebula right', 'talk us through these two images yeah so', 'I love hearing all the oo and a from the', \"audience you're the best audience ever\", \"okay so we're looking at this beautiful\", 'area of starbirth right these tall', 'column Columns of gas and dust it', \"they're just teeming with new baby stars\", 'that are being formed and then you can', 'see on the Hubble image which is a', 'relatively deep image on the left left', \"right you can see that there's really a\", 'Darth of stars you can see where those', 'clumps of gas and dust where those', 'Stellar nurseries are are kind of they', 'look almost like attached and really', 'kind of connected and then you look on', 'that same field of view from the James', 'web Space Telescope and what are you', \"seeing like it's sparkling with stars\", 'right you can capture all of that', \"sparkling amazingness and then you're\", 'also starting to see that there are like', 'little newborn Stars those are some of', 'those really bright red patches that you', \"can see as well and again now you're\", 'seeing more about the inherent structure', 'of those tall pillars in gas and dust', 'where the stars are forming and the', 'population of stars around them because', 'Stars may be born in a nursery together', 'but then they kind of grow up and go out', \"on their way and you're kind of seeing\", 'some of that happen which is I think', 'pretty awesome and so why is infrared', 'good for that because infrared is like', 'being able to see through things right', \"it's kind of like well I can't use the\", \"X-ray analogy CU I'm going to use that\", \"later but it's about being able to peer\", 'through a very different way and capture',

know so uh infrared has', 'that ability to look through so tell me', 'about wave lengths and frequencies', \"what's going on there so light is kind\", 'of like the byproduct of this hurly', 'Burly you know frisky puppy kind of', 'energy of matter all right you might', \"look at the chair you're sitting on and\", \"think it's solid and motionless but if\", \"you're peering down to the atomic level\", \"you're actually able to see all of the\", 'movement of those atoms right and so', 'light is that by product of all of that', 'activity so like a photon a packet of', 'energy is kind of like

is high', \"energy it's going to barf up a high\", 'energy Photon yes exactly is the', 'universe really just that simple barfing', 'up photons I think so I mean I feel like', 'that could be a book okay', 'um or something I guess so know you', 'should write', 'it people will buy that especially young', \"people I'm telling you right now barfing\", \"up photons I I'm I want to go get it\",

you come along and put a an', 'x-ray telescope on it and what did you', 'find um so the Crab Nebula is this', 'beautiful example of what happened when', 'a really massive star who starts running',

and sanded it down Pike's\", 'Peak would be like less than an inch', \"tall like it's a a truly like Smooth\", 'process and to be honest I think they', 'might still be the most smooth mirrors', \"ever produced to this day well I've\", 'still got to get through your Colorado', \"color you're saying if Colorado took the\", 'whole state just smooth the break which', 'has Rockies going right through it if', 'you made Colorado as smooth as the', 'mirrors onra on chra Pikes Peak less', 'than an inch Pikes Peak one in above the', 'surface of the state of Colorado and', 'they also have to be super clean by the', 'way so if you take like the size of', 'there goes New', 'York yeah I could see that so if you', 'take something like the size of computer', 'monitor you could only have one teeny', 'tiny

metal', \"very dense yep because you don't want\", 'the x-rays busted into it exactly like', \"bullet into a wall you don't want that\", 'so you have to create this very smooth', 'process for the x-rays to go down 30 ft', 'to the sensitive detectors wait a minute', '30t so this is in a spaceborn telescope', \"how'd you get it up there well it's\", 'about the size of a school bus so we',

yeah you know we know they're\", 'screwed yeah yeah so if chander if they', 'had a problem with launch and chander', 'was still on board and they had to come', 'back it would have been very very',

it's not\", 'Loosey Goosey in there you know what I', \"mean it's not like a pair of glasses\", 'rattling around in your suitcase so yeah', \"yeah they're screwed yeah yeah okay but\", 'it worked but it worked amazingly', 'beautiful it worked perfect a shout out', 'to the engineers that work closely with', 'the scientists to make all this work yep', \"it's not the scientist inventing that no\", 'no no but like everyone the astronauts', 'the mission controllers everyone like', 'they were just on point yeah oh give me', 'a couple more examples sorry I believe', 'this requires a', 'USA yeah that is a good one', 'USA well you know I like that the', \"Olympics are over okay I know but it's\", 'okay not the Olympics of space baby we', 'are still gold medal I mean if we could', 'take a moment of national pride x-ray', 'astronomy was created in the US and like', 'we have this incredible expertise that', 'to this day like chander is still the', 'most highresolution x-ray detector that', \"we have and it's impressive and that's\", \"from the 1990s so we're talking 30 years\", \"yes it it's been 25 years that it was\", 'launched just last month wow yeah', 'yeah excellent I know

have', 'weapons well how you going to do that', 'x-ray detectors did they have a a', 'portable x-ray no they came to the', \"astronomers MH you've got one yes we did\", 'so we we my my people in the day', 'pioneered the x-ray technology that', 'first landed in every airport in the', 'United States yeah in the 1970s right a', 'whole company was created for that', 'American science and engineering which', 'had a Ricardo gone yep who won the Nobel', 'Prize he won the Nobel Prize for effort', 'in x-ray so so the correspondence', 'between moving Frontier of engineering', 'and astrophysics and applications on', 'Earth has it fascinating backstory there', 'but it keeps going to Modern time give', 'me some more examples yeah so uh like I', 'mentioned Chandra was really challenging', 'technologically to build and so', 'technology had to be invented just to', 'create Chandra and so what that means is', 'like when today uh cuz we have so many', 'clever people that know how to recycle', 'these Technologies and create these', \"spin-offs right so today when I'm\", 'getting a mamogram like that technology', 'has been made more high resolution and', 'lower dose because of

don't\", 'know what that word is but you know', \"neither of those words exist that's what\", \"we know you're neither of those we can\", \"make it up we're all friends here\", 'oceanologist and

right that's definitely\", \"part of it I mean it's like when you do\", 'really hard things up there like to get', 'up there like you get to improve things', \"down here and that's really cool yeah so\", 'I know that it gave us airport x-rays', 'but is it possible that Chandra could', \"fix the TSA no no that's asking too much\", \"for chander chandra's got a lot of black\", 'holes to look at so I we you do we left', 'off with with pulsars neutron stars as', \"high energy places uh give me let's keep\", 'going okay black holes talk about that', 'so Chandra actually became a black hole', \"Hunter what's really interesting is the\", 'the actual scientific point of Chandra', 'at first was because when x-ray', 'astronomers looked up into the sky it', 'was just like a sea of x-rays everywhere', 'and so chander was created to resolve', 'that what was called the X-ray', 'background and it was one of the first', 'things chander did and it found that it', \"wasn't just a c at all because chander\", 'brought into sharp focus and found that', 'it was mostly black holes so the early', \"detectors just couldn't just some x-rays\", \"coming from out there somewhere it's\", 'like taking your glasses off it you know', 'you just see a haze well I have very bad', 'Vision so when I take my contacts out', \"that's what chander was so if you take\", \"your glasses off and it's a blur you\", \"would just think there's just a blur of\", 'light right now you boost the resolution', \"and you say well there's a source of\", 'light there exactly right so Chandra', 'Chandra found that there were billions', 'and billions of black holes black hole', 'black Hol each one of these mostly were', 'black holes there was other stuff too of', 'course wait if a black hole if no light', 'escapes a black hole Yeah uh what are', 'you actually seeing then to know that', \"it's a black hole Yeah it's a great\", 'question we just try to', 'SL okay so this is actually Centaurus a', 'this is a very active Galaxy and that', 'very bright white spot at the very', 'center that is essentially the area that', \"the black hole is you'd have to zoom in\", 'super super deep to actually find the', \"black hole ho but that's where it is now\", 'this is an active black hole which means', \"we've also got Jets of this high energy\", 'material streaming out as well past that', 'like Dusty disc of the center area right', 'so that black hole at the center is', 'powering all of that like a amazing', \"energy that you're seeing so back to the\", 'question of like how do we see them if', \"we can't see black holes well so black\", 'holes you know are kind of sitting there', 'doing their thing but they have a lot', \"going on because they're in an ecosystem\", 'right so if there is stuff around that', 'black hole that black hole might need to', \"have a snack if it's an asteroid nearby\", 'and that kind of falls into its', 'gravitational pole there might be a', \"little small x-ray flare if there's like\", 'a big massive star being chomped on by', \"that black hole now you're going to get\", 'a much bigger x-ray flare and those', 'burps can cause all sorts of cool things', \"that chander can see and it's fed by a\", 'disc a accretion disc exactly we call it', 'I have an accretion disc', 'myself middle-aged May', 'where matter', 'gathers and spirals down toilet bowl', \"style and but that's a place that's the\", \"ecosystem I guess you're talking about\", 'right and because as more matter if', \"there's matter available to be consumed\", \"it's got to confront the accretion disc\", 'before it gets into the black hole', \"itself exactly and you're saying that's\", 'where all the action is that is where', \"the action is like that's the downtown\", 'some of you have probably seen like the', 'first images of a black hole from The', 'Event Horizon telescope for example I', 'mean I never thought I would see that in', \"my life time I'll be honest like it that\", 'was just amazing so it gets to see the', 'silhouette of that right that you were', \"just describing it's seeing the shadow\", 'of that black hole what chander sees is', 'further out because every black hole', \"sits in an environment it's not in a\", \"vacuum right so we've got all this stuff\", 'around it and that that stuff kind of', 'tells the story of how the black hole is', 'acting how it what is doing what it is', \"eating if it's sleeping like our own\", 'black hole right now is kind of sleepy', \"it's they call it a sleeping giant the\", 'one in our own milky our own Milky Way', 'Every big Galaxy got its own hole', 'exactly right so ours is kind of sleepy', \"which is what they say I'll take their\", 'word for it um which means like black ho', \"which means we're in a good place though\", \"right so we don't have a whole lot going\", 'on with our super bassive black hole', \"that's cool but in something like\", \"Centaurus a it's awake it is\", 'superpowered and it is blasting out an', \"intense amount of energy cuz there's a\", 'lot happening in it all right so even', 'though everything wants to get in a', 'black hole', \"it's got to work its way there and not\", 'everything makes its way in right', \"because there's so much activity there\", \"there's some actions that actually spew\", \"matter back out right and it's not\", 'coming out of the black hole itself', \"right it's coming out of the ecosystem\", \"around it around exact that's very cool\", \"Isn't that cool okay so now I understand\", 'that you can also detect Dark Matter', 'yeah so dark matter is fascinating right', 'one of the things I love about astronomy', \"is like it's so humbling like we know\", 'nothing we know nothing and so if you', 'think of the the universe is like a', 'jelly bean jar 95% of those jelly beans', \"are going to be black because they're\", 'representing either dark matter or dark', 'energy a very unpopular', 'jar right so dark matter is sort of like', 'the thing that holds things together and', \"dark energy is something that's like\", \"pushing things apart that's kind of I\", 'like to think of them there only 5% of', 'those jelly beans are going to be', 'colored like normal stuffed jelly beans', 'like the ones that you want to eat I', \"don't like the black licorice ones so\", 'like the Cherry ones the whatever the', \"white is coconut I don't even know 5%\", \"that's it most of the universe is dark\", 'and so it was really interesting because', 'when chander started looking at these', 'clusters of galaxies right these these', 'Bays of hot gas if you will um one of', \"them in particular I'm forgetting its\", 'scientific name Abel something um but', 'Nick Dame the bullet cluster clearly', 'showed that the normal matter was',

embedded in that data and\", \"you're trying to essentially communicate\", 'it so you try to figure out all right', 'the best way to communicate this', 'exploded star through sound is through a', \"radial mapping because you're going to\", 'Trace essentially the shape of that', 'exploded storm we have Cass a yes was', \"that an example that's yes okay so so\", 'tell us about Cass a yeah so Cass is an', \"exploded star it's the leftover de\", 'debris field from that star that', 'exploded its guts out all over the', 'universe oh just want to say Cass is', 'sure for', 'Cass a a', \"constellation who's the the queen of\", 'Ethiopia or Egypt so some African', 'country Copa and if you wanted to find', \"her it's just a Big W in the sky yes\", 'that would I actually love that one an', \"asterism the W otherwise it's aone right\", 'okay so so and we just name because we', 'find that object within the stars that', 'track that constellation exactly with a', 'the first it was a a okay so pick it up', 'so chander has looked at this object', 'many many times so as the Hubble Space', 'Telescope and recently the James we web', 'telescope have as well and you can see', \"like it looks electric right so you're\", 'looking at the color coding of this', 'object is actually telling you about', \"chemical composition of it so we're able\", 'to detect with chander because it not', 'only has two detectors it also has like', 'gradings that can essentially uh capture', 'the fingerprint of light that DNA this', 'is just Chandra this is just Chandra and', 'how long is this exposure if you will uh', 'about 2 million seconds okay I know', \"there's not as many x-ray photons in the\", 'universe right and so you do have to', 'look at them you got to wait around for', 'them you got to be patient so I could', 'and do you guys ever I could just apply', 'for I need 2 million seconds worth', 'abbing time I was going to say have you', 'ever uh speak in terms of hours and', 'minutes so you this is actually', 'interesting Target for Chandra because', \"it's in such a great spot of the sky\", 'chander can look at it over and over so', \"it's called a calibration Target because\", 'we can use it to make sure everything on', 'board the telescope is working', \"beautifully so it's not only the time\", 'that scientists have propose for but we', 'also have more time because we check it', 'for like engineering issues as well oh', 'so I I just got to clarify there Copa is', \"a what's called a circumpolar\", \"constellation so it's closer to the\", \"North Star when you're orbiting the\", \"Earth half the sky you can't see cuz\", 'Earth is in the way but some of those', 'stars that are near the poles you get to', 'see for much longer periods of time yeah', \"and when you said was it's almost in\", \"continuous view that would be why it's\", 'in a great view for Chandra I mean', 'Chandra does go about a third of the way', 'to the moon but there is still lots of',

okay so now', 'what are we about to experience here all', \"right so we're going to listen so I\", 'mentioned the chemical elements right so', \"there's iron in here that's like the\", \"purple there's silicon there's sulfur\", \"there's calcium all of these different\", 'elements have been mapped with color so', 'instead of just looking at as a visual', \"we're going to hear those MA to sound\", \"and so the lowest is iron you'll hear it\", 'as we sketch readily from the center', 'where that neutron star is leftover core', 'of that star that exploded and as we go', 'out kind of

'essentially a very bright like shock um', 'from it as it sweeps up into that', 'material around what the blue Rim made', \"of uh it's very electric it's electrons\", \"it's all of that okay so it's not one of\", 'those elements specifically no it is', 'just the highest energy shock from that', 'material okay so this was a supernova', 'yep do we know when the Supernova went', 'off so I think it was about 400 years', \"ago but it's like 11,000 light years\", 'away so you know how old it is is', 'relevant to Earth time or space time', 'yeah so it actually happened 11,000', \"years ago while we're just coming out of\", 'cave okay we just just inventing', 'agriculture but we saw it we saw it uh', 'well there might be tracings of seeing', \"it it's kind of one of those unclear\", 'ones but yeah about 400 years okay so', \"let's check out yeah Okay let's listen\", '[Music]', 'okay this sounded like the philarmonic', 'just warming up tuning up right what T', 'just tuning just before they begin and', 'that was an exploding star yeah the', 'debris field left over when it barfed', 'its guts out all over the place I would', 'have thought more', \"like well we're only hearing the\", 'leftover part so the leftover and you', 'know was really important to communicate', 'so the iron for example that was like', \"the the lowest note that you're hearing\", \"what's cool about this explosion is that\", 'right before it exploded the iron would', 'have been at its core right as the', 'heaviest element that it could produce', 'before the explosion after the explosion', \"it's more along the perimeter that tells\", 'you that this star actually turned', 'itself inside out when it exploded which', \"is very cool and so as you're listening\", 'to it if you have you know the technique', 'to listen well you can hear it as that', 'lower sound really picks up towards the', \"perimeter and I'm just realizing now\", 'that you need to be trained to know how', \"to listen to this sonification that's\", 'not any different from being trained to', 'learn how to look at an image right 100%', 'you need an astronomer there to tell you', 'well this is that and this is that and', 'this is what happened there y we provide', 'captions to kind of help that but yeah', 'and we also separate out each piece so', 'you can hear individually so that you', 'can actually learn to listen yourself', 'but yeah got it so you got another one', 'how about uh the Karina nebula yes this', 'is one of my favorite jwst stunning you', \"can't argue with this one okay what's\", 'going to happen here so in this one', \"we're listening to this beautiful area\", \"of star formation it's called The Cosmic\", 'Cliffs because you can see all of that', 'really cool gas and dust down there', 'towards the bottom that the James web', \"picked up and then you're seeing all of\", 'these young stars that have been', 'recently birthed and are starting to', 'like mature and stuff this one was', 'broken down a little differently because', 'the actual star formation area towards', 'the bottom is so distinct from the', 'visual of just the kind of empty space', 'if you will just Stars up on the top and', \"so it's divided into two pieces and\", \"you'll hear the difference between the\", 'top and the bottom all the stars are', \"sort of like a Cy CL piano uh let's play\", 'it and see if that description makes any', 'sense', 'that was beautiful yeah and you know I', \"should say I don't think I've mentioned\", 'it we actually work with people who are', 'Blinder low vision to create these um', 'because that really is that first', 'desired targeted audience um and then', 'other people obviously enjoy them as', 'well but like we wanted to make sure as', 'somebody who has to listen to the world', 'around them that it made sense to people', 'who are Blinder lision otherwise what', 'are you doing right go home right', 'exactly go home do you guys ever think', 'about uh starting a radio station that', 'would be really cool just space so the', 'gas clouds were get telling us something', 'different from the Star points right', \"exactly you're getting like that whoos\", 'of all the texture of the dust and the', 'gas from that star formation area and', \"then you're hearing the individual Stars\", \"picked out as I don't know clickity\", \"clacky it's not like a thing you have to\", \"describe it I'm sure if there's a\", 'musician you could find find something', 'better but you know having that', 'differentiation of understanding them is', 'really helpful now one distinction of', \"course is when you're cited you see the\", 'whole picture at once but the audio', 'track gives you time is is a scan across', 'it either left to right in that case or', 'Center to Edge I found that actually to', \"be really important I'm so glad you\", 'brought that that up because I look and', \"I'm used to looking the most right as\", \"someone who's Visual and I have found\", 'that I have learned things about data I', 'have been looking at for dozens of years', \"because I'm listening to it over time\", \"and it's you know spoon feeding a piece\", 'a slice of the image at a time it gives', 'me time to think about what else could', \"be happening and I've actually learn to\", 'digest it and to process it in a', \"different way and I love that that's a\", 'possibility is this something would', 'improve if we closed our eyes oh yeah I', 'think so as an activity like maybe the', 'next one have them listen to that one', \"okay let's okay what's the next one\", 'maybe we should just listen to it first', 'and then I describe as something a', 'little different what we okay so the', 'next one is v404 Sig I think v44 signey', 'so V sounds like a variable star mhm', 'yeah and this is this is a what this is', 'actually a a black hole a stellar Mass', 'black hole so one of the smaller ones', \"and it's got a companion star and it's\", 'kind of pulling off some material from', 'what that does is it causes these', 'outbursts that then the light kind of', \"like I don't know bounces off of the gas\", 'and dust and the CH areas around it', \"causing light Echoes and you're seeing\", 'the light Echoes as those rings in the', \"X-ray light but you're going to hear it\", 'I think more distinctly should we close', \"our eyes for yeah let's close let's do\", \"that they'll be fun\", '[Music]', \"feel like we're in like a meditation\", 'class right now yeah yeah yeah yeah so', 'in that image you like just to emphasize', 'there are these places these sort of', 'concentric rings that are the emitted', 'gas from explosive episodes in the past', 'to slowly move out then you have another', \"exposive episode but there's a gap\", 'between them and if you have another', \"sort of episode there'll be an energy\", \"wave that'll overtake those yep and then\", \"render them visible right and so it's\", \"kind of like you know if you're driving\", 'in fog your your lights kind of scatter', \"in that weird way that's that's kind of\", \"what we're seeing and so you're able to\", 'kind of trace the timing of this burping', 'of this black hole in this way which is', 'really cool but all that gas and dust', \"that it's ricocheting off that's kind of\", 'what that sound we were trying to mimic', 'as you were hearing it almost sounds', 'like ocean waves which I feel like is', 'very appropriate to the Hampton yes and', 'and how do you determine what sound to', 'AIX I was going to ask that to the data', \"yeah so it's a few things so we have a\", 'whole team I work with um Matt Russo and', 'Andrew Santo who are both musicians Matt', 'is an astrophysicist um and we also work', 'with Christine mik who is a consultant', 'who is blind as well and with a science', \"like story that we're putting together\", \"we're trying to make sure it is as\", 'authentic as possible to the data', 'because it is a mathematical

sounds that will hopefully', 'differentiate the objects the best and', 'also describe the science the best and', 'in a pacing that lets you process the', 'data at the best pace so those are all', \"things that we test for wow so it's not\", 'just you Rogue in the back room not a', 'conductor yeah yeah no no no no no no', 'and Dr Dre had I know be fun though that', 'would be yeah do you have any hip-hop no', \"I don't yet but maybe that'll change\", 'yeah hip-hop and it I mean when you say', \"black hole there's got to be some hipop\", 'somewhere it', 'this dark matter dark energy', 'it fits now Hubble had a deep field yes', 'so did anyone do the crazy thing with', 'Chandra they just look at in the middle', 'of nowhere we did the crazy thing with', 'Chandra 40 days and 40 nights we looked', 'at this one patch I know it', 'is we looked at this patch of the sky', 'and um what we found was just a', 'beautiful field of black hole so it', \"looks like you're looking at stars in\", 'this image this is actually the deepest', \"x-ray image we've ever captured so this\", \"is really special if you're trying to\", \"describe it it's like someone just\", 'flecked like paint onto a black', \"rectangle right it doesn't necessarily\", 'communicate the excitement of the', 'science as like I think of it like this', 'is the awesomest image ever um and so', \"what we're going to do these dots on a\", \"page these dots on a page cuz they're\", 'black holes they are thousands of black', 'holes it was the highest concentration', 'of black holes that we had looked at', \"this cuz it can't see x-rays this would\", 'just be filled with stars or galaxies or', 'galaxies yeah right but chander is', 'detecting that high energy anything else', \"there right it's Jordie focusing in on\",

important', 'one to sonify um because I think it', \"actually tells the story better so we're\", 'going to listen to a scan from the', \"bottom up to the top because it's\", 'actually in Stereo and each of these', 'black holes is essentially colorcoded by', \"energy that's a Technique we often use\", 'in image processing uh the lowest energy', 'material will be color CED to red and', 'the

to the\", \"lowest note and we've done the opposite\", \"the blue is the highest and so you'll\", 'hear that population of black holes I', 'think in a very unique way just right', \"here we don't otherwise know just\", 'somewhere brighter than others right but', \"we don't know which has the highest\", \"frequency okay let's check it out\", '[Music]', 'yo that is my', \"jail that's the one that's my favorite\", \"that the one right there it's kind of\", \"viby VI yeah oh that's number one with a\", 'bullet baby yes but like you just listen', 'to a population of thousands of these', 'Superman of black holes like billions of', 'light years away for the most part right', \"and you've just heard that as you sweep\", 'through that field which I think is', 'pretty fun that was

X-rays I believe are like um whoy', 'sound I have to come up with better', \"descript I've just\", \"realized you'll hear the Stars very\", \"distinctly and then you'll hear um a\", 'very strong kind

yeah I\", \"gives you the response it's like I just\", \"pressed that button right and that's the\", 'idea right so like using these other', 'senses to be able to try to extrapolate', 'out more um from our data is is', \"something that I'm super excited about\", 'yeah and how about other ways of', 'visualization which are familiar to us', \"all whether or not we're embedded with\", 'them so

It's just a puzzle. Hey, you\", \"got one from science. Yeah, that's\", \"great. Yeah. I mean, so one that's um\", \"more I'm not going to be able to state\", 'the exact nature of this question, but I', 'can give you like the high level', \"overview, which I know Neil, you're\", \"going to know this, but um there's a set\", 'of equations that describe fluid flow.', \"They're very famous. They're called the\", \"Na'vi equations. Yeah. Yeah.

You don't like clearly that\", \"shouldn't happen. You don't think that\", 'would happen in the in the physical', 'world, but the mathematical model being', 'used in the pure landscape of what are', \"called differential equations, it it's\", \"got these properties where people aren't\", 'sure whether it falls one way or', \"another.

No one actually knows. And this', 'is clearly motivated by modeling physics', 'and modeling the world. Now you also', 'have a category of problems that are', 'unsolvable', 'yet you have people who think that they', 'solved it. Right? So you you can prove', \"that something's unsolvable. Correct?\", 'Everyone might have seen in school the', 'quadratic equation.

Here's the\", 'quadratic formula. Uh, what you get for', 'number 13?', 'Looking over the shoulder. But so I mean', \"it's it was I remember getting drilled\", 'into us on a level where it prevented me', 'from appreciating what it was actually', 'doing, right? It was just a memorizable', 'formula.

I just did that', 'by wrote, not cuz I had freaking feeling', 'for it. You just had to know it so many', 'times. Yeah. I got it from eighth grade.', \"It came in. Okay. Here's something you\", 'should be thankful for. So there exists', 'a formula to solve any cubic equation,', 'but our our teachers never made us', \"memorize it. It's much longer. Yeah.

Um but like pure mathematicians', 'for a while were curious. Okay. Hey, how', 'how far can we take this? you know, do', 'can we have a formula that solves any um', 'equation where the highest power of x is', \"x to the 4th? And you can.

Um, and between the 1500s when', 'this was kind of initially being', 'explored with the cubic and everything', 'up to around the 1800s, people tried,', 'but no one could find a way to answer', 'that. Wait, you tell me people had these', 'thoughts in the 1500s while others were', 'disembowing heretics.', \"Yeah, it's these two things coexisted.\", \"It's It's wild to contrast history of\", 'science. Well, maybe they stopped by the', '1500s. The the Renaissance was kicking', \"in. Exactly. I'm thinking maybe like the\", 'dark ages. Mhm. Well, you go to the', 'right part of the world. You know, one', \"person's contemplating cubics, you can\", 'definitely find another part of the', 'world where disembowings happen. Just', 'skipping to the punch line here, and', \"I'll tell a little bit more story behind\", \"it. The answer ended up being um it's\", 'literally impossible in the appropriate', \"sense. Like, if you're trying to write a\", 'formula using the usual symbols that we', 'do, plus minus times divide, maybe you', 'allow for roots and things like that.

He's got\", 'this classic story behind him in terms', 'of the duel and all that, but the math', 'that he was doing, one of the things', \"that it showed is that it's impossible\", 'to solve equations degree five or', 'higher. It also showed other', \"impossibilities. There's this classic\", 'problem about um tricing the angle using', 'a straight edge and compass to take any', 'angle and divide it into three pieces.', 'His theories, his like new math can', \"prove that that's not possible. Um, it's\", \"it's simply too hard to describe right\", 'here over a podcast, but it it gave', 'birth to a whole field of math that is', 'both central to math and also particle', 'physics these days.

Okay. Uh, could you please', 'explain this a little better for me?', 'Thanks, Gina from North Carolina.', 'Wait, wait, wait, wait.

However you want to', \"phrase it, it's the relationship between\", \"those two that's fundamentally\", \"irrational. So it's like a like a game\", 'of whack-a-ole.

This is', 'something that follows from the', 'Pythagorean theorem. This is another', 'situation where this geometric length', 'has an irrational relationship with the', 'the first length we drew. So the ratio', 'between that diagonal and the square', 'side length is the square root of two.', \"Now that is irrational. It's also much\", 'much easier to prove to you why it must', 'be irrational. And if you will uh', \"indulge me, I think it's possible to do\", 'this in like 45 seconds and you can we', 'can we can see how this goes. All right,', 'you ready? Here we go. Proof that square', 'root of two is irrational. Assume that', 'you could write it down as a rational', 'number, right?

So\", 'if if you wrote something down like um 4', '/ two you could reduce that to be 2 / 1.', \"So there's no common factor you can\", 'reduce this thing down. So if that was', 'true, P / Q is the same as the square', \"root of two. By definition, you're\", 'saying that P ^2 / Q ^2 is equal to 2.', \"So that's what it would mean by\", 'definition. So that means um when you', 'like multiply everything out by the', 'bottom that Q ^2 P ^2 is going to equal', '2 * Q ^2. So if this if you could come', 'up with some numbers where it was true,', 'you must admit that P ^2 is the same as', '2 * Q ^2. that means that P is an even', \"number because it's two times something.\", 'P must be an even number.', \"Um, yeah. And so you're like, okay, I\", \"don't know. Let's let's call P uh, you\", 'know, 2 * K or something, right? Um,', \"it's some even number. If you then write\", 'this down algebraically and you replace', \"it with 2 * K, you're going to conclude\", 'that Q also has to be an even number.', 'Because when you take that key equation', 'P ^2= 2 * Q ^2 that ends up looking like', '4 * K^2 = 2 * Q ^2. You divide some', 'stuff out and you say hey Q also has to', 'be an even number. So you must conclude', 'that P is even. You must conclude that Q', 'is even. But we assumed at the start', 'that it was a reduced fraction. Both of', \"those numbers couldn't be even otherwise\", \"it wouldn't have been reduced. So there\", 'there cannot be a way to write it as a', 'fraction because otherwise you end up in', 'this infinite regress where somehow both', 'of them have to be even.

It's just a little\", 'weird that to get this irrational number', 'you have to take the ratio of two', \"numbers. That's just a that it's a weird\", 'fact. So great.

Classic tactic what you\", \"do is you say I'm going to start by\", \"assuming it's possible like writing some\", 'notation to say what if it was possible', 'what would follow from that and then you', 'come to some kind of contradiction. Um', 'you say so see if we assumed it was', 'possible we land on this thing that', 'could never be therefore our assumption', \"was false. So that's a that's a very\", 'common mathematician thing.

I don't know if you know\", 'this, but the audio version of the', 'podcast actually posts a week in advance', 'of the video version. And you can get', 'that and Spotify and Apple Podcast and', 'most other podcast outlets that are out', 'there. Multiple ways to ingest all that', \"is cosmic on Star Talk. I'm Tien from\", 'Vietnam. Uh, if your to journey to flat', 'land, what shape would you use, I mean,', 'would you choose to be and what activity', 'would you like to do there? Thank you.', 'Longtime fan of Star Talk and both of', 'you, tell us about Flatland. I happen to', 'have a copy right here on my desk. Oh.', \"Oh, really? That's great. Yeah, I've got\", 'one over on the shelf over here. So this', 'is this is a very classic book where um', 'the author had you imagine a world', \"that's just two-dimensional. So here in\", 'three dimensions you can look left,', 'right, up, down, in and out. But he said', 'what if you were just on this', \"two-dimensional world and that's all the\", 'world was. And so you have a bunch of', 'creatures there. And he was making this', \"analogy to say like wouldn't it be\", 'really hard to describe', 'three-dimensional shapes to them? Like', 'if you have someone who lives in', 'flatland and you want to describe what a', 'cube is or a sphere or like a donut,', 'there are these shapes. You just really', \"can't describe it to them. And then the\", 'purpose of the book was then to say,', \"hey, if there's geometric shapes in four\", 'dimensions, we are it is as hard to', 'describe to us as it is for us to', 'describe to flatlanders. But to the to', 'the question on what shape would I be in', 'flatland?', \"Um, cir I mean it's kind of basic maybe,\", 'but circle seems useful. You can roll', \"around. Um, everything's nice and\", 'symmetric. Uh, you can do circle', 'inversion, which uh, you know, the other', 'patron boy is certainly going to', \"appreciate. Um, but uh that's probably\", 'all I got. As I remember the story, the', 'more sides you had, the more', 'aristocratic you were. Oh, look at you.', 'Right. So, a triangle would be like the', 'lowest the scum of the earth.', \"Those triangles. I can't believe that.\", 'Trying to move in here. They know', 'better. And then the squares and then', \"pentagons, hexagons. So, I think I'd be\", \"a hexagon. Okay. I'd be hexagon. You\", 'want to tessillate the plane? Yes. I', 'want to look at that. Yeah. Although any', 'shape can tessillate, right?', 'Well, not any shape. I mean, you got', 'your squares, you got your triangles.', 'No, no, no. I mean, if you look at if', \"you look at Echer paintings, he is Isn't\", 'that tessillation where you have two', 'Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. two shapes intersect,', \"right? So, the the difference is I'm a\", 'what they call a regular polygon where', 'all my sides are equal to each other.', \"Then it's only the hexagon. But I think\", 'tessillation is all shapes that can do', \"that is called tessellation. Isn't that\", 'right? Well, not any shape can', \"tessillate. So you're right. The\", \"pressure shows you've got this infinite\", 'family that can tessellate. I agree. But', 'yes, like angels and devils', 'tessillating. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.', \"But that you can test that's called\", \"tessellation, isn't it? Mhm. Yeah. 100%.\", \"Right. Right. So So now if you if you're\", 'going to restrict yourself to a to a', \"shape to a a polygon, right? What's\", \"called a regular polygon, then we're\", 'limited, right? But so I want to be a', 'hexagon because you can tile a floor', 'with a hexagon. Yes, you can. Yeah. And', 'get other people to tile with you and', 'you can snuggle and everything fits fits', 'very very snugly together. Snuggly. Very', 'cool. So what shape would you be now', \"that we're talking about tiling? There\", 'was a whole tile that was discovered a', \"couple years ago. That's a single tile\", 'that tessillates in a non-periodic way', \"and it can't tessillate in a periodic\", 'but it only tesses non-periodically. I', 'heard about that. But but is that a', 'regular polygon or is it just some other', \"shape? No, no, no. It's a wild It's not\", 'that weird a shape. Uh it it look it', 'looks like a hat kind of people call it.', \"Um but what's cool is it was discovered\", 'by an amateur. Um so is this people', \"didn't know if such a if there was a\", 'shape that um tiles things', 'non-periodically uh or it tiles things', 'on periodically without having any', 'periodic tiling is the like technical', \"question, but it's just like an\", 'interesting tiling question. An amateur', 'found it and it became a little fun', 'celebrity of the math internet for a', \"couple months back then. So what's the\", 'difference between a periodic and a', 'non-periodic pattern? Great. So most of', 'the patterns you can think of are', \"periodic. Like it's kind of what we mean\", 'by pattern almost. Yeah. Like if you', 'shift the whole picture and it looks', 'identical. So you take your hexagon', 'tiling and then you like shift your view', 'over by one hexagon, it looks identical.', \"So that's what we would mean by\", \"periodic. Um it wasn't even known that\", 'you could have a non-periodic tiling uh', 'for a while. But Penrose, who very', 'famous for physics reasons, uh he found', 'a way to use these two tiles that each', 'look like a rhombus to have a pattern', 'that fills all of space, but it never', \"repeats. So it's a it's a it's a\", 'describable pattern. Um you can describe', 'what it should be, but it never repeats.', 'So when you shift your viewing point, it', \"will never look identical. So there's no\", 'way to shift it to be the same as what', \"it once was. Yeah. It's kind of like how\", 'the digits of pi or these irrational', \"numbers, they they don't repeat\", 'themselves. They just go on and on in a', 'predictable way but not that repeats', \"itself. It's the geometric equivalent of\", 'that. Okay. Very cool. This is William', 'Walker and William Walker says, \"Hello,', 'gentlemen from Florida from the Florida', \"panhandle. I've heard it said that\", 'mathematically we know properties some', \"or all I'm not sure of dimensions higher\", 'than what we', 'observe. Could you please elaborate upon', 'this? What can we say about these', 'dimensions?\" Yeah. How do you get there?', 'Mhm. Great, great, great, great. I think', 'this is one of the big misconceptions', 'when mathematicians talk about higher', 'dimensions. People are like assume that', 'they are talking about something that', 'should be physically realized. But so', \"ultimately when you're doing math,\", 'sometimes you might have something that', 'can be described by multiple numbers.', \"You have some system like a I don't know\", 'little particle moving around and you', 'describe its like velocity with some', 'list of numbers and its position with', 'some list of numbers. And you often find', 'it useful to take all your numbers and', 'just list them together. And if you have', 'a list of three numbers, you could think', 'of it as a point in a three-dimensional', 'space. If you have a list of two', 'numbers, you could think of it as a', 'point in a two-dimensional space', 'uniquely. But the math uniquely. Yeah.', 'And mathematicians and physicists um', \"realize like, hey, sometimes we're\", 'solving a problem and we have a list of', 'like four numbers or five numbers. And', 'it was really useful to be able to like', 'visualize what was going on when it was', 'a list of three numbers by having this', 'unique association between a triplet of', 'numbers and a point in a 3D space.', \"They're like, why can't we do that? Why\", \"can't we say there's some abstract\", 'four-dimensional space, not in like', \"physical reality, but that's just going\", \"to represent whatever problem I'm\", \"solving where there's a quadruplet of\", 'numbers that come up. Or in machine', 'learning these days, right? When a when', 'a a large language model reads your', 'text, the first thing it does is it', 'turns a given word into a really big', 'list of numbers, like tens of thousands', \"of numbers. And it's very common for\", 'researchers to think of that as a point', 'in an insanely highdimensional space and', 'to use geometric ideas to describe', \"what's happening to it through the\", \"model. But of course, we're not saying\", \"there's like a 12,000dimensional space\", \"in physical reality. It's just that it's\", 'a nice way to describe um lists of', 'numbers I have on my shelf here. So', 'these dimensions are placeholders. What?', 'I got it on my shelf here. A Klein', 'bottle bottle opener. I love it. So this', 'is an attempt to represent a', 'four-dimensional object in three', 'dimensions. Yeah. Yeah. So client', 'bottles are are something that um', \"they're most comfortable in four\", 'dimensions. This is where they want to', 'live. And if you try to make them live', 'in three dimensions, they have to like', 'unnaturally cross through themselves.', \"There's no way to put it in three\", 'dimensions without it crossing through', 'itself. So, the quin bottle is a bottle', 'that has no inside. Yeah. Yeah. I think', \"that's a fair way to say it. There's no\", \"You can't distinguish the inside and the\", 'outside. Yeah. I had I had some friends', 'in college who got in trouble for', 'trespassing in a certain building and', 'they um they\\'re like, \"Maybe as part of', 'our defense, we go to the fence outside', 'the building and we apply one twist to', 'it so that the whole fence is a moia', 'strip.\" And this is another one of those', \"shapes where there's no clear notion of\", 'an inside or an outside. Like then we', 'can argue to the authorities that we', \"couldn't have been inside the\", \"trespassing area because there's no\", 'coherent notion of the inside of the', 'relevant area. Were these bored Stanford', \"students? Yeah, these were I don't know\", 'how bored they were, but they were they', 'were creative Stanford students. Yeah.', 'Not creative enough not to go to jail', \"because you're still going down. But\", \"that's clever. You'd have to flip the\", 'fence but then reattach it. Reattach it.', 'Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, in the middle', \"of the night, you know, while you're\", \"doing whatever you're doing, trespassing\", 'there, just make sure that as you leave,', 'you like you cut the fence, you twist', \"the fence, you reattach it so that it's\", 'a moius fence, and then your defense is', 'solid. So, a climb bottle is a', 'four-dimensional version of a Mobius', \"strip kind of. Yeah. I I don't I don't\", \"love that description. I mean, it's what\", 'if you try to take a Mobius strip and', 'you take another Mobius strip and you', \"try to glue their edges together, you'll\", \"get a Klein bottle. It's a very mind\", 'warping thing to try to think about.

That's the key. Time for just\", 'one more question. Okay. All right.', \"Let's go to our old friend Kevin the\", \"Samo. Oh, okay. And Kevin says that's\", 'his last name, the Samo. Okay.

If you can't\", 'accelerate past it, can you exist on the', 'other side?', 'And serious thought was given to that to', \"the point where there's some movies\", \"based on it. And we there's a\", 'hypothetical particle that has these', \"properties. It's called a tachion.\", 'Takios from the Greek meaning fast.', 'Tachios. Tachons. And Tachons would live', 'backwards in time. How is that possible?', 'Because if time slows down as you reach', 'the speed of light on the other side of', 'speed of light, if you continue the', 'equations jumping that gap, time would', 'go backwards for it. Heck yeah. For it', 'for Yes. Yeah. For it. Do we know they', 'exist? No, we never never found them. So', 'then how could you have a theory about', \"something that should because it's\", \"allowed to exist by Einstein's\", 'equations. And if something is allowed,', \"that's good enough reason to go out and\", 'look for it. if other parts. But at one', 'point do you stop looking in all', \"seriousness and go this doesn't if you\", \"can't find it. Welcome to the frontier\", \"of science. No, it's like I can't find\", \"my phone in my house. I'm not going to\", \"keep looking. Go, I know it's there. We\", \"don't know. That's right. It's a\", 'mystery. But if you give up and someone', 'else finds it a month later. So when', 'time meets an object with no gravity and', \"no movement, it's like my lazy good for\", \"nothing 15-year-old son who won't mow\", 'the lawn, right? He just lays just sits', 'there. So the answer to the question is', 'yes on some is it or is it that clear?', \"The answer is wait wasn't there two\", \"parts of that. Yeah. There's the uh an\", 'object approaches the speed of light is', 'in a deep gravitational well time slows', 'to a stop. Yes. In a deep gravitational', 'well. Yes. Time slows. Okay. Correct.', 'And what is on the other side of that', 'extreme and that would be techons.', 'Techons which we are know there but we', \"haven't found them. Okay. Correct. Got\", 'it. The techons work in the equations.', \"So as if as a result and so we're saying\", 'well write all these other ways maybe', 'this prediction of the equation should', 'work as well. Got it. So if you are', \"motionless in space as far as you're\", \"concerned you'll still have your own\", 'timeline and all that matters is what', 'other people will say of you as they fly', 'by you. So everyone will have a', 'different time reference for you. All', 'you care about is your own clock and', 'your own wristwatch and your own clock', \"on the wall. And that's all you care\", \"about. Now that's if you're not moving.\", \"But if there's no\", 'gravity,', 'then time speeds up for you.', 'So if an object is motionless and', \"there's zero gravitational effect, how\", 'would time work for that object? This is', \"where we're talking it's so this is\", 'where we were joking about gravit', 'anti-aging hack. Right. So in other', \"words, you there'd be no aging because\", \"time there's right there's zero\", 'gravitational effect. Yeah. But you and', 'everyone else around you in your same', 'reference frame will age at exactly the', 'same rate. It could be 1 second for', 'every 10 seconds outside of your club.', \"Right. Right. But it won't matter to any\", \"of you. You can't hack that system and\", 'say, \"I want to go back to when I was', 'younger.\" Okay. But if you\\'re so smart,', 'tell me who in that group is going to', 'get plastic surgery first to avoid the', \"aging process. Yeah. Plus, if you're in\", \"space with zero G, some surgeries aren't\", 'necessary.', \"No. Well, yeah, it's right because you\", 'got nothing pulling on you. Have nothing', \"pulling on you. Stuff floats. That's\", 'what we should invent. We should invent', 'people zero G facial surgery. I like', \"this question. It's very simple,\", 'straightforward, but interesting. Dennis', 'Albertie, please explain buoyancy.', \"Buoyancy. I love it. All right. So, it's\", 'all about density. In the end of the', \"day, it's about density and gravity, you\", 'know. So if you are and gravity, yes, if', 'you are less dense than the medium', \"you're immersed in, you will float to\", \"the top. It's that simple. It's not more\", 'complicated than that. Define density.', \"It's how much matter you can cram into a\", \"certain volume. So the big advance, it's\", \"amazing this didn't happen until the\", '19th century, was there was some early', 'variance in the 18th century, but it', 'really took off in the 19th century. the', 'fact that you could float metal. If you', 'make a boat out of', \"metal, then it's almost impervious to\", 'war, not', 'icebergs and a billion dollar gross at', \"the movies. It's exactly what Titanic\", 'did, but probably up to two or three', 'billion now. Look, to summarize it, a', 'submarine is a boat in denial. Well, so', \"here's what happens. So, you should\", 'react to that. That was a good line.', 'So a submarine is a boat in denial. So', \"if you have a hole that's made of metal,\", 'any bits of that metal would just sink', \"to the bottom. However, if it's in the\", \"hole shape, it's pressing down on the\", \"water. The water is rising up and you've\", 'created an environment that on average', 'is less dense than water and so', 'therefore it floats because of the', 'V-shaped because most of the volume is', 'air. So you get to add the air plus the', \"metal as part of the contents that's\", 'within within the volume. And when you', 'do that, you systematically reduce the', 'density of the material. If you go back', 'a thousand years ago, people made boats', 'out of wood sensibly because wood', 'floats. So you make anything out of', 'wood, it would float. That made complete', \"sense. But you're susceptible to attack.\", 'But if I took a metal plank, a a a 4 by', '12 piece of metal flat and threw it in', 'the water, would that sink? Yes. Because', \"you don't have that Vshape.

So if you if you carve it', 'into a', \"volume, then it's the mass of the shell\", 'divided by the full volume of the whole', \"thing. And that gets very low, it' be\", \"lower than water. It'll just float. It's\", 'the same principle why an iceberg can', \"float because you've icebergs are just\", 'simply less dense than water, right?', \"Simply less dense. So you don't need\", 'that Vshape for that to for an iceberg.', \"No. No. No. I mean, you don't you don't\", 'ever need a Vshape except that I mean,', 'like styrofoam will make a boat, but it', \"doesn't need a Vshape, right? These\", 'shapes are important if you know the', \"material you're working with is heavier\", 'than than the stuff itself. Right.', \"Because you're display you want to\", \"displace. Correct. Right.

This is a this is actually a very', 'interesting one. Terry Burke from St.', 'Louis. My question is simple. In nuclear', 'fision and fusion, a small amount of', 'matter is lost and converted to a large', 'amount of energy. Is the gravity', 'associated with the lost mass also lost?', 'No. Because great question by the way.', 'Gravity emanates not only from mass but', 'also from energy because mass and energy', 'are the same thing. Different sides of', \"the same coin. So you're not just losing\", 'mass and not', \"energy. You're losing some combination\", 'of the two and they go hand in hand. So', 'the answer is no. Is the gravity', 'associated with the loss? No. And that', 'can never vary. I mean this is this is a', 'con this is a constant. This can never', 'this the idea that that gravity', 'associated with the lost mass is also', 'lost. Oh matter and energy are one in', 'the same thing. Mhm. So they each', 'distort the fabric of space and time.', \"And that's all you need to know about\", 'it. Okay. Mhm. We will commonly think of', \"matter distorting space, but if there's\", 'energy there, it will distort space as', 'well. And equals MC² reminds us that', \"they're two sides of the same coin. The\", 'the more the amount of energy is created', 'is is the same amount of gravity lost.', 'In other words, like the mass lost is', 'gravity associated with the lost mass is', 'also lost. Do you lose more gravity the', \"more energy that's created if it leaves\", \"the system? Yes, you're losing you're\", 'losing gravity anytime any matter or', 'energy leaves the system.

you', 'brought wave people together and had', 'that lunch what you talk', 'no this particular kind of wave was', \"discovered in the 1700s wow by I've\", 'forgotten who a a a physicist in in', 'England who saw a boat that was being', 'pulled by horses and it was just', 'starting up and it created this wave', 'that traveled down a channel a canal uh', 'and it was peaked like the wave in',

title', 'straight here the under Secretary of', 'Commerce for oceans and atmosphere and', \"that's a different title from being Noah\", 'administrator is that right yeah', 'actually my full title will probably', 'take the full duration of this show but', 'it is the under Secretary of Commerce', 'Roan and atmosphere and the', 'administrator of Noah the National', 'Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', \"so it's really two hats in this job and\", \"we're reminded that Commerce which is a\", 'huge branch of the US government cares', 'about climate and weather and because', 'goods and services are delivered through', 'the air on the waters over the land and', 'our relationship with climate is deeply', 'impacted yeah like Commerce and um the', 'melting uh ice that is causing Passage', 'through uh a near Alaska and where', \"there's it's a contested Waters now\", 'because you have Russia who wants that', 'water uh and we of course and China and', \"it's all because it was ice and nobody's\", 'looking at the point that it was', 'Ice what was once ice is now open Waters', \"it's now water right yeah yeah that's so\", 'so so tell me a couple of things here uh', 'what is your relationship with the Navy', 'because obviously they care about oceans', \"as well yeah so that's a great question\", 'because I actually worked for the Navy', 'for the first part of my professional', 'career and I was is there any part of', \"the government you don't work\", 'for yeah Congress I have not worked for', \"congress yet and that probably won't\", 'happen either uh but Navy I mean', 'obviously Navy cares about uh oceans and', \"climate and atmosph here uh and it's not\", 'just how they operate their ships', \"they're going to be concerned about what\", 'the impacts of climate are going to be', 'for their their bases you know you think', \"about norfol where we've got the\", 'Atlantic Fleet and sea level rise', 'impacting the operations uh at the base', \"there it's an important element of Naval\", 'operations and North Virginia yeah north', 'of Virginia yeah but I could say the', 'same thing about just any just about', 'anywhere the Navy operates they do care', 'about the Shor side facilities uh but', 'they also care about the ability to fly', 'uh and carry out their missions and', 'obviously I mean one of the strongest', 'components for Navy is understanding how', 'the ocean uh changes what are the', 'Dynamics of the ocean how does that', 'affect ships and submarines right and', \"also uh last I checked there's several\", 'whole countries in the in the South', 'Pacific where the average sea level is', 'just only a few feet the aage elevation', 'of the land is only a few feet above sea', 'level so if we start melting out', \"glaciers we'll lose entire countries\", 'creating is what do they call it climate', 'refugees this exactly exactly and and', 'this is not some sort of theoretical', \"thing that'll happen a thousand years\", 'from now the sea level rise uh rate that', \"you're alluding to has increased\", 'dramatically when I when I was a grad', 'student you know few decades back we', 'would talk about sea level rises being', 'say 1 to three millimeters per year in', \"some places it's doubled or tripled and\", 'so consequently some of these nations', 'are actually going to be eliminated', \"before the end of this Century they'll\", 'actually be underwater right yeah whole', 'islands whole island nations that will', 'disappear whole island nations and I', 'tell me of course everyone cares about', 'the weather although climate change has', 'been politicized as we all know recently', \"i' I'd like to remind people that Noah\", 'was founded in the year uh', '1970 and it was signed into law by a', 'Republican president so the', 'politicization', 'of climate um to me feels like a very', 'recent phenomenon because clearly we all', 'care about the weather and nobody wants', 'to to have the weather get the best of', 'them in any part of their life or or or', 'job yeah I think the the a lot of the uh', 'making it a political issue comes from', \"trying to figure out who's whose fault\", 'this is you know who do we get to blame', 'for this the the thing about Noah is', 'that our mission is very much looking to', \"the Future we're about predictions and\", \"projections and so for us it's less\", 'about hey who caused this problem and', 'more about how well can we predict what', 'the change is going to be in the future', \"we talk about that's what people hold\", \"you to because they're trying to make\", 'decisions based on your predictions', 'however you you have a moving goalpost', 'at all times Rick because quite frankly', 'what happens is um these projections are', 'modled on what we have now okay but the', 'variable is is um do we increase the', \"amount of fossil fuel that we're burning\", \"because I mean that's really the issue\", 'so as you have fossil fuel burning', 'coming online that changes everything', 'that you guys said was going to happen', 'for instance um the predictions that', 'were made previous to now um basically', \"everybody's like oh yeah well they're\", 'all wrong but first they were saying', \"they're going to be wrong because it's\", \"not going to happen now they're saying\", \"wrong because it's happening much\", 'quicker yeah model would normally have a', 'future expectation for a rate of CO2', \"increase or a rate of anything isn't\", \"that right uh Rick yeah that's right and\", 'and this is what climate scientists', 'would call the Assumption of', 'stationarity that is to say that things', \"now are what they're going to be in the\", \"future and it's not and that's the whole\", 'point is so how do you take the models', 'that you were talking about Neil and uh', 'initialize them put the data in up front', 'to start the model what assumptions do', 'you make about how those conditions are', 'going to change in a year in 10 years in', \"20 years that's the challenge we have in\", \"front of us but we're getting really\", 'good and improving the skill on those', 'models now Rick have you has your scope', \"been uh I'm wondering\", 'it I think when Noah was founded by the', 'way I I did a deep dive into this', 'hardly anyone certainly not even', 'geologists or biologists had ever', 'combined ocean and Air in the same sort', 'of conversation there were atmospheric', 'scientists there were Oceanic scientists', 'and the full system the full the full um', 'organic system of all these interplaying', 'parts it seemed to me only came of age a', 'little later when uh computer models', 'started having something to say about it', 'and so now I what I what I POs to you is', \"now what's under Noah purview is also\", 'space weather like what the sun is doing', 'so these these look like land grabs to', \"me we're\", 'spacecraft you started out with just the', 'ocean in there now you want like the', \"solar system the universe we're going\", 'for the universe going for yeah Neil', \"you're exactly right and it is an earth\", 'system and the best place to see that is', 'in how hurricanes form and grow and move', \"you can't predict that without a good\", 'understanding of the ocean and the', 'atmosphere and you know the best example', 'on that one was uh Hurricane Katrina', 'which as you may remember intensified', 'really quickly before it made landfall', 'around New Orleans and we now looking', 'back no we could have predicted that', \"better if we'd had better data from the\", 'ocean in the Gulf of Mexico', 'happen today you would have predicted it', 'better than we were able to do back in', '2005 yeah certainly the what we call the', 'rapid intensification of the hurricane', \"as it made landfall and that's because\", 'we would look at the whole ocean not', 'just the surface of the ocean to put the', 'data yeah you guys you guys I mean', \"you're not you're being humble Because\", \"You're Not tooting your own horn about\", 'this last uh huge storm that we just', 'experienced um where the rapid int', 'ification was predicted and did happen', 'indeed um uh due primarily to the amount', 'of moisture that was being held in the', 'land mass uh where the storm was uh', 'going to Traverse so you know you should', \"you should say yeah we didn't do it back\", 'in 2005 but take this we did it', \"now I'm sorry I don't think I don't\", 'think he speaks that way', 'Chu I love the way you said that though', 'Chuck because right I that was Rick', 'catch us up on on this thing with land', 'water and how that is not neutral as as', 'a', 'forcing as a forcing factor on a', 'hurricane that makes landfall what I', 'understood there was a recent hurricane', 'that saturated the landscape the the', 'land and so now when a hurricane makes', 'landfall there is sort of latent heat', 'available to it from the water that is', 'in the saturated ground or because', 'normally hurricane would would weaken as', \"it goes over the land right yeah it's\", 'all about temperatures right and so we', 'know the temperatures of the ocean in', 'this case the Gulf of Mexico are going', 'up know the temperatures in the', 'atmosphere are going up which means that', 'those storms can hold more water and so', 'think about it we had hurricane Harvey', 'that hit Houston and it dropped five', 'feet five feet of rain when I was a kid', \"we didn't talk about feet of rain from\", 'and so now you look at what hurricane', 'Helen just a few weeks ago did', 'especially in Western North Carolina and', \"the damage was water you're absolutely\", 'right most people think hurricane so', \"it's about winds wind in that case it\", 'was water but in terms of the forcing', 'function on the hurricane itself that', \"water that's sort of still had had had\", 'rendered land masses uh soaked are you', 'saying that that does not continue to', \"play into the other than the water's got\", 'nowhere else to go I guess you just get', \"yeah well that's basically it it it I\", \"think it's a combination if you've got\", \"if you've got soaked uh uh terrain from\", 'previous precipitation prior to the', \"hurricane coming in and that Hurricane's\", 'got more moisture than it would have', 'before Helen was also huge it was a', 'massive hurricane it was 500 miles', \"across uh and that's that's\", 'significantly larger than most', 'hurricanes so large hurricane warm', 'Waters so more moisture available the', 'ground was already pretty wet and now', \"you're just dumping buckets onto a wet\", \"sponge so it's going to cause a lot of\", 'flooding why do I have in my notes that', 'you also care about the bottom of the', 'ocean like what what what what does that', \"do for you well there's a hole in the\", 'bottom of the', \"ocean no there's a plug oh that's right\", 'yeah yeah the bottom of the ocean is', 'important because without a bottom of', \"the ocean we wouldn't have an ocean I\", 'guess okay more important I mean so the', 'Topography of the ocean is going to', 'drive help Drive uh how the currents uh', 'especially in coastal environments where', \"the water goes how it flows uh it's\", 'going to impact things like uh', \"accentuated tides in areas where you've\", 'got extreme changes in topography so why', 'is this important especially in the', 'context of a hurricane probably one of', 'the biggest problems one of the most', 'devastating aspects of hurricanes is', 'storm surge what happens to the water', 'the ocean water when it gets close to', 'the shore if the Topography is just', 'right you can actually funnel that storm', 'surge and you can end up with 12 to 15', \"feet that's what they got in Tampa Bay\", 'when uh hurricane Milton hit yeah and', 'and Hurricane Sandy hit New York I mean', 'I think it was tropical storm Sandy at', 'the point it hit New York but that storm', 'surge is what took us out it we actually', 'call it superstorm Sandy because it was', 'both a tropical cyclone and then there', 'was an nor Easter component to it as', 'well so it was kind of like the worst of', \"all factors combined and yeah you're\", 'right storm surge yeah I you know I grew', 'up in New York and mom was living in an', 'apartment that got flooded as a result', 'of superstorm sanding uh and we did not', \"that's interesting that was what 12\", \"years ago we didn't have the forecast\", 'down pat', 'yet you know having a front row seat to', \"Neil's life over the years and also\", 'being a parent myself I

fair to\", 'say that I mean obviously the sun has a', 'luminosity and an energy but but but it', 'at the next level the sun cycles and', \"there solar storms and so it's not just\", \"that there's a star there delivering\", 'energy to your model there are these', 'fluctuations in the energy to the model', 'that now you guys seem to car about yeah', 'so the the the Sun is a pretty Dynamic', 'uh object and uh it goes through these', \"Cycles right and we're actually in the\", 'middle of one of these 11year Cycles it', 'started last year and one of the really', 'interesting aspects of that is that the', 'sun can occasionally actually send out', 'these huge huge coronal mass injections', 'which are these charged gases plasmas', 'that get ejected from the surface of the', 'Sun at a speed of about 1 to 2 million', 'miles hour uh they are on the sort of', 'positive side the the factors that', 'create the beautiful Northern Lights the', 'Aurora Borealis but a little bit more', 'insidiously

\"seen in decades but you didn't hear\", 'about it much well I know you did Neil', \"but a lot hear about it and and that's\", 'because we knew it was coming and in', 'years past we might not have

you see the actual', 'discharge as it makes its way here that', 'is so cool yes you can and in fact we', 'have just launched uh in June of 2024 we', \"launched a new satellite it's a weather\", \"satellite it's the one that you would\", 'use when you turn on TV and they show', 'you the full disc of what the weather', 'patterns are in the East Coast or West', 'Coast but this one has a compact', \"coronagraph oh and that is the tool I'm\", 'sorry I you guys lost me Neil said oh', 'nice you said you said compact', 'coronograph like uh you know like I say', \"uh my glasses case it's just like my\", \"glasses case and I'm like okay what is a\", 'compact coronagraph I got this so one of', 'the great inventions of of the recent', 'Century has been the ability to create', 'an image of the Sun in a telescope as', 'though with a set of Optics as though', 'the sun had just been eclipsed by the', 'moon oh and when the sun gets eclipsed', 'by the moon all the bright stuff is',

you put', \"one of these in orbit that's cool Yeah\", 'we actually have that one in orbit there', 'is another sensor on the Discover', 'satellite which is at the L1 the lrange', 'one point um the Earth Sun lrange yes', \"exactly okay now Chuck don't we have a\", 'lrange explainer we do for those of you', 'who want to uh really go a deep dive on', 'lrange points uh we go all all through', \"all l12 34 and it's uh really incredible\", \"um M5 can't leave out M5 uh\", 'um clearly I was only a pay attention', 'for', \"four five's important because we're\", 'really', 'good years all gr points

just asking um so with all your\", 'equipment because Noah is really a space', \"organization I mean you're looking back\", \"at Earth but all your stuff's up in the\", 'space no no they got buoys and stuff', \"that's true that's true I take it back I\", \"take it back okay you're absolutely\", 'right um but when you when you talk', 'about these ejections do you move that', 'stuff or is that stuff just hardened or', 'what do you because I mean radiations', 'has got to be like the most damaging', \"thing for equipment right yeah you're\", 'not going to be able to move this I mean', 'this is immense amounts of energy but', \"what you can do is it's it actually it's\", 'really similar to our discussion on', \"hurricanes we're not going to be able to\", 'move hurricanes and spite of what some', 'people may think but we can make the', 'predictions work and we can tell people', \"this one's bearing down here on Tampa\", 'plus or minus 20 miles and you got two', 'days to evacuate same thing with space', 'weather if we get the picture especially', \"if you've got multiple views we can say\", 'this is going to hit pretty hard in the', 'northern part of Quebec or in Asia and', 'therefore folks can make adjustments', 'they have three days they can power down', \"their grids they're electrical grids\", \"they can revor aircraft so they're not\", 'going to be affected for navigation', 'purposes Chuck asked about the the', 'satellites that are already in orbit', 'they certainly have susceptibility to', \"this and you can't just say hey Bank a\", \"left or hover over Africa until it's\", \"clear over Asia right you can't do that\", \"you can't uh we can Shield some of these\", 'to a certain extent but what we can do', \"is again if we know it's coming we can\", 'make accommodations with regard to power', 'or use another satellite uh to cover for', 'the one that most be mo might be most', 'vulnerable the sacrifice', \"satellite yeah no we don't do that we\", \"don't put them\", \"up so there's something called\", 'unexpected events now I foresee the day', 'where no event is unexpected and so no', 'one is taken by surprise where are we', \"now with regard to Noah's modeling and\", 'other agencies modeling and things just', 'happening taking Everyone by surprise', \"there's a really interesting aspect to\", 'your your question Neil because um', \"there's a there's a famous story in\", \"meteorology it's called Isaac storm in\", 'fact Eric Larson wrote a great book on', 'Isaac storm and it was a hurricane that', 'hit galvaston in the year 1900 for the', 'folks in galvaston in 1900 that storm', \"was an unexpected storm they didn't\", \"expect it to hit now obviously there's\", 'never going to be another Isaac storm', \"we've improved that there are things\", 'though that happen uh on much shorter', 'time scales and so I would say', 'they may not be unexpected like', \"tornadoes U but the time that we're able\", 'to give people to react to them and is', \"shorter so right now for tornadoes we're\", 'looking at an average lead time on most', 'tornadoes of about 12 minutes whoa about', '50 years ago the lead time on tornadoes', 'was minus five', \"minutes okay that doesn't even make any\", \"sense I'm just saying when the tornadoes\", 'over I already know there was a tornado', \"that's right that's right yeah there is\", 'something wrong with that picture um', \"wait just just to clarify you're not\", 'talking about the prediction of the', \"existence of a tornado you're talking\", 'about the path a tornado will take once', \"it forms yeah yeah the path it's going\", \"to take and how intense it's going to be\", 'gotcha yeah and because there are like', 'like with hurricanes tornadoes have', 'classifications by intensity we have the', 'extended fueta scale for tornadoes one', \"through five uh and it's the same kind\", 'of thing so right now we can say we', 'think this tornado or this uh this', 'aggregation of tornadoes is going to', \"take this path and it's probably going\", \"to be an ef2 and it's probably going to\", 'hit over here in 15 minutes by the way', '12 minutes 15 minutes is enough time to', 'get out of the way of a tornado or or to', 'go or underground yeah underground yeah', \"so that's an that's incredible how do\", 'you feel I mean do we have deep resonant', 'emotions uh when for example you go to', 'see a a movie that you know stormchasers', 'movie you know yeah Twisters Twisters', \"how how do you let's commiserate\", 'together here now uh how do you feel', 'when you see these films how how much', 'effort do they call you and say help us', 'get this right or they just make stuff', 'up and and and and is it true that in a', 'tornado I can actually call a cow as it', 'comes by and it goes', 'and then', \"disappears of course Chuck that's a\", 'stupid question everybody knows', 'that uh we are not using bow Vine', 'sensors and tornadoes uh for our', 'forecast systems yet', 'so the cow could just totally hook you', 'up on', 'that what is your if mind if I ask what', \"is Noah's annual budget uh it's just\", 'under s billion would you say that', \"Noah's effort saves people and lives and\", 'on a level far beyond the value of that', 'budget well I I mean we talk about', \"answer is yes Rick you're the head of\", 'the', \"organization for Christ's sake man NE\", 'answer is yes right thank you', 'Rick the uh we talk about lives and', 'livelihoods and and Lifestyles so', 'property and lives um but certainly', 'lives and the only reason I HED is', 'because I can give you the best forecast', 'in the world I can give you plenty of', 'lead time', \"but it's your decision to evacuate it's\", 'your decision to take action and we', \"can't control that so we like to think\", 'that two things one the quality of our', 'forecast is getting better and the', 'second is the trust by the public in', 'that forecast uh and the on onscreen', 'meteorologists and emergency managers is', 'high enough so that when we say you', 'better Evacuate the storm is coming your', 'way people actually take that action but', \"there's no question I mean I talked to\", 'you about the the storm in galston in', 'the year um 1900 and I think the number', 'was something like 10,000 lives were', \"lost in that storm wow my that's not\", 'ever going to happen again in this', \"country ever and that's because of the\", 'quality of the forecast and our ability', 'to have the trusted people to make these', \"decisions so yeah absolutely we're\", 'saving and you also affect uh forecast', 'for Fisheries right and other sort of', 'coastal management of marine food is', 'that a so we do Marine forecasts as part', 'of what the weather service does and we', 'also have responsibility for managing', \"marine fisheries uh which means we're\", 'the ones who do the stock assessments of', 'how many fish are out there how healthy', 'are the fish how healthy are the', 'populations and establish regulations', 'for how to sustainably fish for these uh', 'uh these fish and maintain a strong', \"Seafood economy again we're part of the\", \"Department of Commerce so it's an\", 'important economic consideration so with', \"respect to what you just said uh what's\", 'your relationship with other countries I', \"know we're a National Organization but\", 'do you have international affiliations', \"like for the typhoon that's raging in\", 'Taiwan right now or when it comes to', 'sustain sustainability of food supply', \"like working with China who just doesn't\", 'give a damn', \"so but but what what's your role there\", 'we we care about our Coastline and our', 'and our uh our Oceanic uh prop Oceanic', \"property line if you will but if you're\", 'studying the entire Earth with regard to', 'climate do you share your data with', 'other countries and are they responsive', \"and what's your relationship yeah yeah\", \"we absolutely can't do our job without\", 'strong International collaboration and', 'that takes a couple of different forms', 'there are worldwide organizations as the', 'World Meteorological organization of', 'which we are a member and in fact the', 'head of our national weather service is', 'the US Representative to the wo uh and', \"it's these are organizations that\", 'establish uh policies with regard to', 'data and yeah all of our Noah data is', 'publicly available uh and we use that as', 'if you will lever to say to other', \"nations hey we're giving you ours why\", \"don't you give us yours as well so\", \"there's a lot of collaboration for data\", 'and they recognize they need our data to', 'improve their forecast we need they', 'their data to improve our forecast and', 'when you start talking about Fisheries', \"yeah there's a lot of international\", 'agreements because a lot of the fish are', 'in open ocean Waters and there have to', 'be', 'agreements and and the Agreements are', 'not just about hey how much fish can we', 'take sustainably that is to say to allow', 'the population of the fish to stay stay', 'uh uh healthy but also to try to um be', 'the Protectors of those uh Fisheries by', 'um enforcing laws against illegal', 'unreported and unregulated Fisheries', 'what we call iuu fishing uh so that Rees', 'a lot of international cooperation', \"because you know what it's a big big\", \"ocean you know it's not the same thing\", \"but it's it's similar in some ways the\", 'Artemis Accord which has recently been', 'signed by upwards of 30 countries or so', \"is a it's a new agreement about conduct\", 'in space and space exploration signed by', \"space fairing Nations it's an active\", \"Accord that's going on right now and so\", 'for example if you send a Rover to the', 'moon or Mars and you learn something', 'about it you would share that with other', 'countries so if they send a Rover they', \"don't have to make the same mistakes you\", 'did or that you can collaborate so uh', \"it's interesting how the\", 'internationality of what you do uh', 'certainly uh would would contain tap', 'rots for doing things cooperatively in', \"space there there's yeah and I think\", \"there's a lot of commonality there and\", 'the I thought that was going through', 'your mind my mind as you were talking', 'about the emis Accords Neil is that we', 'to have similar kind of agreements for', \"making observations in the ocean there's\", 'no one nation that can cover all of the', 'ocean and so uh we have a a major', \"program it's called Argo and it's\", 'basically these uh robots that go', 'throughout the ocean and they go up and', 'down and all over and they drift around', 'and we by International agreement have', \"said let's all agree to what these\", 'robots these floats should look like', \"let's all build them to these specs\", \"let's put all of these things out so\", \"there's about four or 5 thousand of\", \"these out there now and they've been\", \"floating around for decades and let's\", 'all share the data in a common data', 'repository these are those buoys that I', 'was thinking about is that right these', \"actually dive down so they don't spend a\", 'lot of time at the surface they they', 'float around and then they ascend to', 'about 1,000 or 2,000 meters depth they', 'collect temperature solinity other kind', \"of variables are measured they'll drift\", 'for about 10 days days out of 2,000', 'meters then come back to the surface', 'transmit their data through satellite', 'Communications to a central repository', 'and then dive back down again and start', 'you know rinse and repeat basically you', \"know that's badass I just have to say is\", 'yeah now you know there are some Nations', 'though they probably got a back door', \"like if you find oil don't tell anybody\", \"else hey Star Talk fans I don't know if\", 'you know this but the audio version of', 'the podcast actually posts a week in', 'advance of the video version and you can', 'get that in Spotify and apple podcast', 'and most other podcast Outlets that are', 'out there multiple ways to ingest all', \"that is Cosmic on Star talk let's take\", 'up this subject of climate change for', 'the moment so we know I is it the is the', 'fraction a third so for every x amount', 'of CO2 that goes into the atmosphere', 'does the ocean uptake about a third of', 'that or some fraction of it yeah yeah', \"there's a variety of estimates but\", \"that's that's pretty close maybe even\", 'closer to a half but definitely a large', 'percentage okay so and the that means', 'the dissolved CO2 in the ocean is in', 'some form of partial pressure', 'equilibrium with the CO2 in the air so', 'if we were to stop CO2 production or', 'even introduce CO2 scrubbers in the', 'atmosphere we will do this but then', \"there's less CO2 pressing down on the\", 'ocean and the ocean says I have to make', 'this in make equilibrium out of this and', \"it'll start releasing and it gives it up\", 'to the atmosphere gives it up to the', 'atmosphere so is it true that we would', 'not see the immediate effects for quite', 'some time perhaps decades even if we', 'stopped all fossil fuel burning today', 'the short answer to your question Neil', 'is yes people talk about the flywheel in', 'the carbon cycle uh you could stop the', 'introduction uh interesting you raised', 'the question of actually actively', 'removing carbon dioxide from the', 'atmosphere which would accelerate the', 'the diminishment of excess carbon', 'dioxide in the atmosphere but it would', \"still be yeah you're right decades\", 'before we would see the ocean responding', 'in Kind part of the uh the problem uh', 'with the dynamic you described is that', 'the increased carbon dioxide dissolution', 'in the ocean manifests as ocean', 'acidification', 'right pH thing going on okay of course', \"yeah and so in that case it's not simply\", \"a matter of it's not like opening up a\", 'bottle of of of Coca-Cola and having all', 'the CO2 uh go back out of the liquid', 'into the atmosphere a lot of this CO2', 'has become part of the carbon cycle', 'within the atmosphere in in including', 'with a decrease in PH and increased', \"acidification and that's where you see\", 'the uh complete bleaching of coral reefs', 'and the death of of of these coral reefs', 'which by the way are their in entire', 'ecosystems in themselves yeah yeah', \"that's part of it uh in fact the the\", 'major contribution to Coral bleaching is', 'actually the temperature temperature the', 'warming of the water but because of the', 'chemical makeup of most corals The', 'increased acidification uh is very', 'erosive gross of vent corls so when', 'people talk about terraforming Mars and', 'moving there', \"I'm sorry that was just an excellent\", 'segue Earth be uh my rebuttal to that', \"it's not rebuttal my comment on it is if\", 'we have the power of geoengineering to', 'turn Mars into Earth then we have the', 'power of geoengineering to turn Earth', \"back into Earth you wouldn't need Mars\", \"right yeah to do that and so that's kind\", 'of how I how I view that so Rick this', 'past hurricane season', 'the was it just my imagination or were', 'there more category lives kicking in', 'than usual and if so is that the new', 'normal and what what what is the new', \"normal right now today I we're recording\", \"this in October it's like 75 degrees\", 'outside uh when it says unseasonably', 'warm temperatures today will that soon', 'become seasonably', \"warm that's unseasonable becomes\", \"seasonable because that's the new normal\", 'and will we need a category six because', 'these category fives keep getting bigger', 'and bigger and it keep saying category', \"five but it's a storm we've never seen\", 'before when are we getting to category', 'six Chuck stop poking the bear what', \"you're doing I love that question Chuck\", 'and I will get to it in a minute I but', 'what I I do want to say is um yeah I', 'keep thinking about uh the New York', 'Times Colonist Tom Freedman who said', \"it's not global warming it's Global\", 'weirding weirding and you know and if', \"think about it Neil we don't talk global\", 'warming anymore we talk climate change', \"and that's because it manifests in so\", 'many many different ways and and', \"fundamentally fundamentally what we're\", \"doing is we're putting more energy into\", 'the system because of the greenhouse', \"effect there's more energy coming into\", 'the system so your question about uh', \"what's going to be seasonable or not\", 'seasonable what are the storms look like', 'things are going to be different uh this', 'year for example we predicted an above', \"normal uh hurricane season and it's\", 'turning out it is above normal by', 'certain measures is that going to become', 'The New Normal well I think just logic', 'suggests that we can probably see a lot', 'more hurricane activity in the future in', 'terms of the intensity of storms how', 'much water they have with them that sort', \"of thing which gets to Chuck's comment\", \"and that is you know my take is it's not\", 'about do we need another category a', 'category six in the saffer Simpson scale', 'want you to name it after him a a Chuck', 'hurricane is a category six hurricane', \"well there's something wrong with\", 'calling something a nice hurricane', \"that's the no not we'll call it not so\", 'nice not so nice no you leave out his', 'last name just called the Chuck', 'hurricane the Chuck', 'hurricane what we really need in that', 'regard is uh to expand the focus because', 'you know the the saffer Simpson scale is', 'really a measure of of wind right uh how', 'strong are the winds and you see that', 'every time hey the winds have just', 'gotten to 130 M miles an hour so now', \"it's a cat war that kind of thing but\", 'when you look at what these hurricanes', \"are doing we're looking at impacts of\", 'storm surge I talked about the volumes', 'of water from hurricanes like like', 'Harvey years ago we need people to', 'understand that we should be looking at', 'more than just what the peak wind is', 'because you could have a cat five with', 'really strong 170 m hour winds but it', 'may not have the impact that a cat 3 has', 'with a large volume of water like', 'hurricane h', 'we find way for people the full me of', 'what the hurricanes are what they look', 'and what their imps going to be and let', 'me toot your horn for a moment here in', 'the', '1989 sequel to Back to the Future titled', 'Back to the Future Part Two uh they went', 'into the future the year', \"2015 and so we're watching this movie in\", \"1989 and they're they are Imagining the\", \"year 2015 and there's a point where\", 'Marty and and', 'and Doc get out of the car and Doc puts', 'up an umbrella and Marty says what are', 'you doing he says oh this is the future', 'weather forecasting is now we know the', \"exact minute it's going to start to rain\", 'and right in that instant it starts to', 'rain and it stops ready stops and then', 'it stops and he puts the umbrella away', \"we're not exactly there but of course on\", \"our smartphones it'll show you when the\", 'rain is going to begin where you are and', \"where it's end that's what I'm saying\", \"that's true I never even thought of that\", \"but it's it gives you the time of day\", 'like 3 p.m. starts yeah in your spot and', 'and it tells you how much and how', 'intense and Chuck when we were growing', 'up it was like all you really want to', 'know what what might it rain tomorrow', 'because you have a and then they give', 'you a 50% chance which means they know', 'absolutely nothing right your', 'grandmother knew more my badis is acting', \"up my shoulder I tell you baby it's\", 'going to rain tomor my shoulder how for', \"all you know Noah's got Grandma's in the\", 'back', 'room yeah', \"right e how's your knee I tell you I\", \"tell you it's going to rain and eel\", 'predicts the Hurricanes', \"exactly well you know it's interesting\", 'because I was gonna say Neil that yeah I', 'do have a couple apps on my phone in', 'fact and I use it for just that okay you', 'know should we have that picnic now or', 'should we wait an hour that kind of', \"thing and that's less about the\", 'prediction and more about the', 'observations and so the The Radars that', \"we've got the satellites have got so\", 'much resolution right now that you can', 'start doing that you can right within an', 'hour or two you can say hey this storm I', \"mean I use it all the time when I'm when\", \"I'm walking my dog I'm saying all right\", 'should I do it now or should I wait an', \"hour so you're say you're saying that's\", 'because we have real-time observation of', \"what's exactly exactly yeah yeah and we\", 'can uh and tornadoes are a really good', \"example you know we've gotten really\", 'good at observing tornadoes using some', 'of the new sophisticated applications we', 'use something called dual polarization', 'on our weather radars which is in the', 'old Radars it was basically just send', 'out a signal and see what comes back and', 'now we can start manipulating the signal', 'looking at the polarization of the', 'signal to determine uh is that rain is', 'it sleet is it snow and get such good', \"resolution that we can say yeah it's\", 'sleet but we know the temperature two', 'miles away is warmer and we can see how', \"fast it's coming so in an hour it's\", 'going to be rain over', 'here okay so cool man we actually fly', \"through the hurricanes and we've been\", 'doing that for quite a while we have uh', 'two actually more than that we have at', 'least three airplanes that we use to fly', \"through or over the Hurricanes that's\", 'the right stuff right there want talk', \"right stuff man and I've done that once\", 'I did it once with our team who you got', 'piss off to get that', 'job but all fair is Rick if I I I some', \"of the math on this if you're standing\", 'there on stationary Earth and 170 mph', \"wind is coming by you that that's going\", 'to Tumble buses and trucks and the cow', 'of course will fly by however um an', 'airplane in open air flies 500 600 miles', 'an hour way faster than the air in a', 'hurricane so is it not as

'professionals and the equipment that we', 'fly we actually fly 50-year-old', \"airplanes but we're scheduled to buy\", 'some brand new ones here soon and we fly', 'uh Navy p3s the same airplanes that the', 'Navy used to use to find submarines and', \"here's the kicker that we fly them high\", 'enough through the hurricane that yeah', 'when you go through the eyewall the', \"hurricane where there's extraordinary\", \"vertical uh wind currents you're going\", 'to go through several thousand feet of', 'uh uh elevation change if you did that', 'on a commercial flight to Cleveland uh', \"you'd have a real problem and you'd be\", 'sending a complaint to the airline G to', 'be a lot of uh vouchers giving out at', 'the end of that flight and and we do it', \"repeatedly we'll fly we'll do like a a a\", 'figure four pattern through the', 'hurricane two or three times and then', 'the other really cool thing though is we', \"don't just fly those aircraft through\", 'the Hurricanes at say 8 10,000

but it has the ability to do so', 'regardless is that a fair statement well', 'that that is true but I think they', 'originally designed pan Stars hoping to', 'find Interstellar objects because for', 'the last couple of decades I mean we', 'know the solar system has ejected a good', 'amount of material in in interstellar', \"objects so it's not much of a stretch to\", 'imagine that other planetary

that we hadn't\", 'seen any we were trying to put limits on', 'the number of them in the Galaxy based', 'on not seeing any but the Hope was that', 'pan Stars would find one right so if you', \"don't

all everybody', 'else has an orbit that is bound to the', \"sun that's right so either be like a\", 'circle or an ellipse yes right exactly', 'so these comments that we see every once', \"in a while

only', 'seen that once why you got to do that to', \"my life I ain't living to 152 on cut a\", 'brother a break', 'you will not be 152 years old I know I', 'have hypertension but', 'damn just saying yeah so hyperbolic so', 'that would be the best evidence that it', 'was not a member of the solar system', 'because Comics are coming from out far', \"away all the time that's right so why\", \"isn't it just an asteroid why do you\", \"know it's a comet so there is kind of a\", 'Continuum between comets and asteroids', 'uh oh so now we okay so now we get into', 'word', 'issues word', 'definitions yeah so the things that', 'formed at large distances from the Sun', \"they have ice in them which hasn't\", 'evaporated away exactly over the years', 'eons yeah exactly so when that a comet', 'gets close to the Sun the ice will heat', 'up and sublimate producing a dust tail', 'and that produces a Bright Beautiful', \"commentary tale he can't say evaporate\", \"yeah can't right itates got use the real\", \"word of course yes to regular fol it's\", \"just it's evaporating yeah exactly but\", 'no sublimates remind us what sublimate', 'means so that is when the ice in a well', 'not just in a comet but when ice', 'transitions straight to the gas form', 'straight straight away without melting', 'in between yeah so what they call dry', 'ice oh okay that just smokes away that', \"right you've never seen liquid dry ice\", \"have you no you haven't right it goes\", 'right to the and Now ladies and', 'gentlemen coming to the stage it goes', 'right straight from the ice to the Smoke', 'to the', 'Smoke yeah in fact if you have a ice', 'tray in your freezer okay you long', 'vacation and come back the ice cubes are', 'little yeah have you ever to check this', 'out I have seen that yeah you see them', 'they shrink up inside the actual TR yeah', 'they actually sublimating oh okay so so', \"so keep going I interrupted you we're\", 'distinguishing between com on the', 'Continuum of asteroids and comets go', 'right we expected that the interstellar', 'objects that get ejected from other', 'planetary systems that they most likely', 'would have formed at large distances and', \"then had a lot of ice in them so we'd\", 'expect them to be comets is that because', \"if they form at a large distance they're\", 'not strongly held by the gravity of', 'their host star yeah so they can be', \"knocked off that's exactly right okay\", 'and if they form at far distances then', \"they haven't been close enough to their\", 'host stars for the yeah so you get a', 'double Force going there so may I ask if', \"if they're forming at such large\", 'distances from their host star what', 'happens to get them to be kicked out so', \"that they're now slingshot it out into\", \"hey I'm on see you I'm on my way yeah no\", \"that's a great question so and it's a\", \"good question because we also don't know\", 'the', 'answer so stop asking a guest questions', \"he can't answer chck but the most likely\", 'thing is you basically have something', 'like a deep space maneuver for a', 'spacecraft where you slingshot off of a', 'planet but you have that with something', 'as big as Jupiter I mean their version', 'of a Jupiter yeah their version of a', \"Jupiter so something with Jupiter's mass\", 'at around five astronomical units then', 'if you get if a small body gets close to', 'that planet it could get slungshot out', 'so Jupiter is like a proxy Sun or a', 'Jupiter type it acts like like it would', 'be the Sun Well it messes with the oh it', 'it messes with the orbits things that', \"it's more yeah it's more like when you\", 'get close to Jupiter you start feeling', 'its gravitational influence much more', 'than the Sun and then that will change', 'your or gotcha okay now I get it I get', 'it I get it Jupiter intervenes', 'intervenes right so but also presumably', 'given enough time this this other star', 'system may get tugged on by other stars', 'that happen to wander Too Close yes', \"that's exactly right yeah that it also\", 'can happen Okay so again why are you', 'thinking this was a comet instead of an', 'asteroid so am mua mua in every way we', 'expected acted the exact opposite so the', 'biggest thing was it had no cometary', 'tail whatsoever so then why call it a', 'comet at all well then it was initially', 'called a comet because they uh made a', 'mistake actually the minor planet center', 'then they changed it to say that it was', 'an asteroid because it looked inactive', \"which means that it doesn't look like a\", \"comet because it doesn't look like it\", \"has a tail doesn't reveal FL that's\", 'exactly right but then we realized as we', 'were trying to get follow-up', 'observations with the Hubble Space', 'Telescope and the Spitzer Space', 'Telescope that the object had a', 'non-gravitational acceleration so', 'Spitzer is specializes in infrared if I', 'remember correctly ex good good so you', 'want to you want to combine different', 'tools the toolkit of the observational', 'astronomer to see it in as many ways as', 'you can okay and Spitzer is really great', 'like looking in the infed is really', 'great for Comet science for some of the', 'same reasons you use it for things like', 'exoplanets but because you can see', 'typical cometary gases like CO2 and Co', \"that you wouldn't be able to see from\", 'the ground so Spitzer named for Lyman', \"Spitzer oh okay's a former chair of the\", 'astrophysics group at Princeton', 'University ah and I have one of his', 'books on my show I was going to say you', 'sound like you know him', \"way so I keep interrupting you it's okay\", 'keep going go essentially it had this', 'non-gravitational acceleration but no', 'apparent dust coma and then an important', 'point is that these non-gravitational', 'accelerations we see them on so first of', 'all what that means is that the object', 'you look over time at its position in', 'the sky and then you figure out its', 'orbit and then you realize that its', 'orbit could not be explained just from', \"the sun's gravitational influence so\", 'there must be an additional Force acting', 'on it and we measure that what you mean', \"by non-gravitational that's what I mean\", 'by non-gravitational so we measure that', 'in comets all of the time MH so there', 'are many comets with non-ra and I might', 'even slip up and just call them non', 'gravs but these non graphs have been', \"measured and that's happening because as\", 'that ice sublimates it produces like a', 'rocket type recoil effect okay so every', 'jet little bitty Jetty thing that comes', \"off it's a force operating on its\", \"trajectory yes that's exactly right so\", 'that alone is Not Unusual or uncommon', \"that alone is not uncommon that's didn't\", \"have any fuzz that's right exactly and\", \"you want there to be fuzz if you're\", \"going to be non-gravitational that's\", \"right so you're in a conundrum yes and\", 'there is another kind of important point', 'which is that you will also see', 'asteroids accelerating non-g', \"gravitationally it's just that their\", 'non-gravitational', 'accelerations for example they can be', 'caused by solar pressure radiation', \"pressure they're much much weaker so a\", 'mu mu is non-gravitational acceleration', 'the weird thing is not that it had one', \"it's that it had one with no dust coma\", 'but it was much stronger than those that', 'could be operating on asteroid so cuz I', 'think asteroids many of them are very', 'dark so that they would absorb sunlight', \"yes and that if you was you're absorbing\", \"momentum of photons so it's like a solar\", 'Cil at that point oh yeah well', 'theem but in either case the the light', 'pressure is acting on the great okay so', \"it's a nice conundrum and by the way I'm\", 'a big reader of the history of science', \"yeah why wouldn't you have a conundrum\", 'for an object that has never been', 'detected before yes a class of object', \"that we've never seen yes why wouldn't\", \"it be filled with things that that don't\", \"make sense that don't make sense well it\", 'basically made me think like I am really', 'grateful for am mu mua because I feel', 'like am mua mua if you look back for the', 'last couple decades it was the most', 'intensely studied small body over a very', 'short period of time so there were', 'something like 700 and something', 'observations over the span of a couple', \"weeks just of this one object that's\", 'evidence of how unusual it was right but', 'because of that and because we then had', 'to point Spitzer and Hubble at it we', 'then had to get the trajectory really', 'really accurate and then we noticed this', 'non-gravitational acceleration so it', 'made me think maybe there are just these', 'other objects in the solar system that', \"are doing the same thing it's just we\", 'had never noticed them before because', 'how do you detect comets you see their', \"cometary Tales right you don't see the\", 'non-gravitational accelerations which', 'are actually dark Comet yes I get it', 'there we go mhm okay is there a', \"consensus cuz we're now eight years into\", 'it right so you should you should know', 'something by now so I would say that', 'well I would like to say that me and', \"Jenny Bergner's recent theory about am\", 'mua mua is the consensus but', 'unfortunately there are a lot of', 'theories Einstein had a theory we had a', 'hypothesis we had a hypothesis so say', 'that', 'again Neil gets very touching about his',

will sublimate okay so I', 'thought anything that can turn to gas is', 'volatile is that not true that is', 'technically true is water in space', 'volatile yes but so water in its ice', 'phase is what I mean by volatiles okay', \"and you wouldn't find a swimming pool of\", 'liquid water out there anyway got it', 'okay so in practice it all starts as ice', \"it's ice it's ice that can sublimate\", 'these are your volatiles ice of any kind', 'not just water ice but like ammonia ice', 'I guess give me some more CO2 ice CO2', 'dry water ice nitrogen nitrogen ice okay', 'yeah so they have that on Pluto so there', 'is nitrogen ice on Pluto so to back it', 'up essentially in the solar system', 'comets they the primary driver of', 'activity the the main thing you see is', 'water ice and then you also see CO2 and', 'Co which is carbon dioxide and carbon', 'monoxide so those are the typical ones', 'but with a mua mua Spitzer the reason', 'they looked at that is you would', 'identify CO2 and Co because that those', 'have spectral signatures in the infrared', 'with spit are especially capable of', 'detecting in ways that Hubble would not', \"be able to that's right so another issue\", 'is that without getting too much in the', 'details essentially water could not be', 'providing the acceleration because there', 'was not enough energy from the Sun to', \"sublimate the water yeah that's right\", 'sublimate enough water to provide enough', 'push to get the acceleration but a much', 'better accelerant is hydrogen so our', 'hypothesis not', 'theory he thought about it he was like', \"so I'm GNA say it cuz I'm\", 'here okay the hypothesis is that there', 'was water in water in a mua mua but then', 'as it travels through the interstellar', \"medium it's exposed to these very high\", 'energy particles called cosmic rays and', 'that will break down some water and trap', 'hydrogen in there and then as the ice', 'heats up as a mua mua comes through the', 'solar system it will just gently release', 'this trapped hydrogen which has a', 'greater', 'impulse to accelerate the object then', \"that's right than just evaporating water\", \"would that's right so it's both the fact\", 'that hydrogen is a lot lighter than', 'water but also it takes much less energy', 'to sublimate hydrogen than water wow', \"okay so all right but you said there's\", 'nearly a thousand papers on this object', \"and you're saying but you and your\", 'colleague have this hypothesis right are', 'you lone wolves out there no no no so', 'essentially it comes down to can you can', 'a hypothesis explain all of these', 'mysterious properties another thing is', 'you could have the acceleration driven', \"by radiation pressure it's just for that\", 'to work it would have to be ultra thin', 'or ultra low density so Amaya MOA Martin', 'at Space Telescope has this idea that it', 'was an ultra low density fractal', \"aggregate which basically means it's a\", \"very large snowflake so it's large but\", \"with very low density that's right right\", \"so there's a lot of so you can push it\", \"that's right you can push it yeah yeah\", \"that's right so the solar photons which\", 'very subtly push asteroids could', 'suddenly push push this a lot like right', \"a lot harder because it's not doesn't\", \"have a orbital companion there's no way\", 'you can know the mass of this thing you', 'have to make assumptions about it so yes', \"that's totally right yes that is a\", 'detail that I intentionally swept under', 'the rug but yes no this rug here is', 'clean all right so is that is that the', \"betting person's explanation the way to\", 'test this was is there another one of', 'these objects and I seem to remember', 'there was yeah there so there was', 'another one another Interstellar object', 'but this this was two I borisov so that', 'was detected in 2019 and that was very', 'clearly a comet so that had a big dust', 'tail okay but the exciting thing is that', 'the r ruin Observatory and lsst which', \"I'll probably refer to it as is coming\", 'online just next year far ruin another', 'astrophysicist died a few years back she', 'uh discovered dark matter in galaxies', 'yeah back in the 70s so we named a whole', 'Observatory after her and this is an', 'observatory that unlike any other in', 'what important way right so it is coming', 'online right now at the beginning of', 'next year that would be 2025 2025 right', \"what's the observatory going to do so\", \"it's going to observe the entire\", 'southern hemisphere almost every night', \"so it'll be like pan stars now which is\", \"in the northern hemisphere but it'll\", 'look almost every night to see anything', 'moving in the sky but it goes almost', 'five orders of magnitude more sensitive',

you just\", 'go to a telescope and get images and', \"bring them home you don't know if\", 'anything is moving on that image right', 'you know you got to get it over a period', \"of time they're basically snapshots you\", 'need exactly those kind of data right to', 'see if something goes bump in the night', \"that's right so the Ruben telescope\", 'should blow open the whole field yes', \"absolutely gotcha wow that's pretty cool\", \"so it's pretty exciting is right now\", 'okay are there any other explanations', 'for this', 'aliens come on guys just why we trying', \"to act like we're not going to talk\", \"about the elephant in the room that's\", \"the easiest explanation but it's got to\", 'be right like ever or or ancient', 'astronauts or something you know', 'whatever exctly so I feel a little', 'jealous because if amua mua got kicked', 'out of some other solar system star', \"system and we're a star system red\", 'blooded star system we ought to have', \"some amua muas of our own I've been\", 'kicked out of better Star systems than', 'this', 'yeah essentially in the last couple of', \"years since amua mua we've discovered\", 'these seven objects within the solar', 'system which are near Earth objects', 'actually which is what amua mua was', 'initially uh they thought it was AO it', \"thought it was a Neo that's right you're\", 'picking up on the uh abbreviation also', 'so they thought it was a near Earth', 'object so these are near Earth objects', 'which are bound to the solar system', 'unlike a mua mua so they have elliptical', \"orbits not hyperbolic orbits that's\", 'correct we discovered significant', 'non-gravitational accelerations on all', 'seven of these objects which are also', \"inactive which means that they don't\", 'have Comet like Tails oh okay so', \"therefore you can't credit the normal\", 'Comet non-gravitational', \"outgassing that's right but the\", 'accelerations we found on these dark', 'comets or I mean dark comets is just a m', 'name I made up hope I think people like', 'it but because you', 'not so these objects essentially their', 'non-gravitational accelerations are too', 'strong to be explained by the similar to', 'a mua mua the accelerations you see on', 'other asteroids so we have', 'the', \"hypothesis that's awesome that's awesome\", 'we have the hypothesis that these', 'objects are like comets and that they', 'have icy material in them even though', 'they are close to the Sun and have been', \"there for a long time but they're for\", 'whatever reason not producing a large', 'dust coma could you have a layer of', 'something other than ice that encases', 'ice within it oh yeah so that prevents a', \"full up exposure to sun's energy yeah\", 'absolutely and so that was actually an', 'idea that was an idea that I wrote a', 'paper on that could have for am mua mua', 'like the interstellar medium the cosmic', 'rays basically could have produced an', 'insulating shell around it that could', 'have prevented out guessing but that was', 'before we knew that the', 'non-gravitational acceleration was there', 'right so just to repeat what I think you', \"said you have an object that's icy has\", 'volatile ices but cosmic rays basically', 'turn the outermost layer of that ice', 'into a an insulating crust yeah right', \"that's right because the water molecule\", \"gets broken yes and now it's no longer\", \"frozen water it's just hydrogen and\", 'oxygen what happens to the oxygen', 'essentially well it depends where it is', 'like like in the idea that Jenny bergner', 'and I had hydrogen and oxygen would be', 'entrapped within the ice separately from', 'each other yes separately from each', 'other but this is more like you can', 'create a kind of tar like material on', \"the it's kind of like asphal almost that\", \"but that's not what happened so then oh\", 'where you get your carbon oh it would', 'have been there originally okay or and', 'you get that in the CO2 or the co carbon', 'is not rare in the universe this is cool', \"so but then how's it re-released then\", 'because you well so you insulated it but', 'then the one thing is I was going to say', 'though is that that certainly is not', 'what happened to a mua mua cuz I wrote', 'that it took like it was discovered in', 'October and then it was May when the', 'acceleration was published so I wrote a', 'paper before the acceleration was', 'published that explained it like that', \"and that's I was certainly wrong about\", \"that it's just that what I was saying\", 'was that uh that how many branches', 'of say I was wrong yeah well listen', \"that's what that's what makes science so\", \"great it's like we're right today we're\", \"not tomorrow we're right tomorrow about\", \"what we weren't today right what did you\", 'just', 'say it sounded good I no but just to be', \"clear we don't always say we're wrong\", 'about things that have been objectively', 'shown to be true right when I say oh E', 'equals act actually equals MC cubed we', \"didn't who who knew noal MC squ we're\", \"good there right it's so if you're in\", \"mid hypothesis and it's being tested\", \"that can come and go and if you're first\", \"out of the box with an idea right that's\", 'highly susceptible to later data that', 'shows up but nothing better than you', 'yourself correct making that adjustment', 'or correction then somebody else coming', 'along and going yeah guess what man you', \"you're a dumbass C this is the way it\", \"works an official science term that's\", 'super cool man well I guess one thing is', 'that these non-gravitational', 'acceleration like you were asking why', \"hadn't we seen them before in the solar\", \"system so they're very difficult to\", \"detect and so with the dark comets it's\", 'been most of them have been known about', \"there's one that I've been known about\", \"for more than 20 years it's just people\", 'have been monitoring it for 20 plus', 'years trying to get the POS trying to', 'measure the position and we finally', 'noticed so David far noia at NASA JPL', 'basically has to figure out the', 'trajectories of all the bodies in the', 'solar system and included in the fits', 'for those non-gravitational acceleration', \"so there's kind of people all over the\", 'world who are monitoring objects that we', 'know of and seeing if any of them could', 'be potentially so you use the term the', 'fit for it what you mean I think is if', \"it's pure gravitational there's a\", 'formula where you can forever predict', \"the future trajectory but if you're not\", 'fitting the future trajectory you have', 'to fit it some other way mathematically', 'right and so you add these other terms', 'that you think you understand yeah and', 'you also I mean he does it numer like', 'numerically just with a supercomputer', 'but you basically try all different', 'types of accelerations numerically means', \"you can't do it analytically right every\", 'step has to have a computation that', 'gives you a a position in the trajectory', \"whereas if it's analytic you can just\", \"run the formula and it'll get you the\", \"whole way yeah it's they both effective\", \"but one of them admits that we don't\", 'fully know the physics of what going on', 'so we have to fit the model yeah fit a', 'model to it yeah so so with the hydrogen', 'and oxygen and comets and all of this', \"does this affect anybody's sense of\", 'where the water on Earth came from right', 'yeah so this is also kind of based on', \"this student who's been working with me\", \"who's just starting just started this\", 'last year you just got out of graduate', 'school and you got students already good', \"for you man I love it man so that's\", 'Aster Taylor who had a paper published', 'that discussed the possibility that the', 'water the dark comets could have brought', 'water to the Earth more so than other', 'comets right', \"well there's so people used to think\", 'that comets delivered water to the Earth', \"and we still don't know where the\", \"Earth's oceans came from and part of the\", \"reason that we're now not sure if comets\", \"delivered the water is because we've\", 'have spacecraft measure spacecraft', 'measurements of water in comets like the', 'rosette emission went to 67p and some of', 'the Isotopes which is some of the things', 'about the water in that Comet did not', \"match that that we've measured in the O\", \"in the earth's oceans this would be dyum\", \"I guess right yes so that's one of them\", 'so the duum to hydrogen ratio so', 'hydrogen is just one proton in the', 'nucleus and the protons Define what we', 'label the element to be so now you', \"throwing a neutron okay it's still\", \"hydrogen but now it's like a little\", \"heavier right so you can't just it's got\", 'to be hydrogen something something you', 'got to be got to need do something right', 'so we call dyum how stable is dyum well', \"it's not that it's stable it's just the\", 'important thing is that the amount of', \"dyum compared to hydrogen isn't going to\", 'change from processing and it depends', 'very critically at the temperature of', 'formation change chemically right so if', \"the comet doesn't match that in the\", \"oceans you can't credit the comet for\", \"delivering that's correct so we don't\", 'know for sure and Aster was very careful', 'to say this in the press releases and', 'news articles about their paper but we', \"can't say for sure that dark comets\", 'could have contributed contributed water', 'to the Earth but they are a new entirely', 'new population of small bodies that are', 'in the a new source potential Source', \"they're in the vicinity of the earth and\", 'they potentially have vitals so we would', 'need follow-up observations to figure', 'out if they match up but the Hayabusa 2', 'mission the jaxa space agency Mission', 'jaxa Japanese Exploration Agency yeah', \"it's

listen I don't have a\", 'problem with it their Hayabusa 2 mission', 'in the extended Mission it just so', 'happens is going to a dark Comet cool so', \"in 2031 we're going to have that'll blow\", \"it open it might well it's at least\", \"going to Rond with it but we'll have\", 'enough sensitivity to measure things', \"like outgassing or dust if it's there so\", 'at the very least the worst case', \"scenario we're going to have an answer\", 'to all this in 2031 now literally comets', \"are dark even when you they don't\", 'satisfy your definition right right we', 'think of them these white things moving', 'through space but their material is very', 'dirty on a level that how reflective is', \"a comet well it's difficult to say\", \"because you don't always see most of the\", \"time you don't even detect the nucleus\", 'or the rocky part of the Comet you just', 'see the tail but Asteroids for example', 'like asteroids typically have albo is', \"the word we use in science but that's\", 'how reflective they are so albo is', 'between something like 0.04 to 0.1 which', \"is like 10ish per that's black yes\", \"that's black okay yeah albo between zero\", \"and one if it's

so\", 'last I checked it was 20 terabytes of', \"data a day that's crazy a day that's a\", \"lot yeah and uh you're right though it's\", 'huge', 'yeah huge huge yeah I mean a big worry', 'is the inar

We believe AI and', 'machine learning is that so that there', 'could exist an isomorphism, a mapping', 'between the biological world and the', 'world of AI, machine learning, hence the', 'name. Hence the name. Gotcha. Gotcha.', 'Gotcha. All right. So uh tell us about', 'protein folding because you know when we', 'learn about chemistry we learn about', \"chemical reactions and we're not really\", 'taught that the shape of the molecule', 'should have anything to do with', \"anything. It's just what is the chemical\", 'symbol and when you write down the', \"chemical equations there there's no\", \"shape in there. There's just what\", 'elements and molecules right comprise', 'it. So, and and those and those', \"equations don't really ever represent\", 'the three-dimensional nature. Exactly.', \"You don't even know which if it's it has\", 'handedness. Yes. Right. So, take us from', 'there. We think about proteins. Proteins', 'are these fundamental building blocks of', \"life. Yeah. They're inside of everyone.\", 'They make up everything we we have', \"basically. And they're made up of of\", \"what's called a sequence of amino acids.\", 'Each amino acid is a molecule. Mhm.', \"There's about 20 different amino acids\", 'and you put them together in a long or', 'just in life. In in in life, you can', 'have non-natural amino acids as well', 'that you that you can make as well. You', 'can make them. You can make them and', 'actually use those for drugs. Sometimes', 'you string these amino acids together', 'and that becomes a protein, but they', \"don't exist as these strings. They fold\", 'up spontaneously in the cell, right, to', \"create these 3D shapes. And why that's\", 'important is that these proteins,', \"they're basically molecular machines.\", \"They don't just exist by themselves.\", 'They actually like create these little', 'pieces of machinery. They they interact', 'with other proteins. They interact with', 'other biomolelecules like DNA and RNA.', 'Right. Um and that interaction is a', 'shape fitting. Exactly. Exactly. So', 'these proteact', \"3D jigsaw puzzle and it's not static.\", 'This is way harder than a 2D jigsaw', 'puzzle. And these are not static things.', \"It's not just static puzzle pieces\", 'coming together. They change shape. So', 'something comes in contact and that', 'opens up something else on the other', 'side of the protein which changes the', 'machine and and on and on it goes. And', \"that's what I was going to ask you. What\", 'speeds is this folding taking place? Is', \"it continuous? Once it folds, that's it.\", \"But you've just told me, no, it just\", 'keeps moving through the whole thing.', 'Yeah, these these these are really', 'really complex dynamical systems, you', 'know, composed of, you know, thousands,', 'millions, trillions of atoms within our', 'cells unfolding over the course of, you', 'know, micros secondsonds and and and', \"beyond. And this dynism that you're\", 'talking about, what word is that?', \"Dinism. That's a word. Isn't that a\", 'word? Dinism. I think I just made it up.', 'Oh, dynism. No, dynamism. Dynamism.', \"Thank you. I'm correcting grammar. This\", 'is a first. This is', 'dynamism. Dynamism. Kind of dinosaur.', 'Dynamism. Dinosaur. Dinosaurs. Dinosaur.', 'Not dinosaur. But the dynamism that', \"you're talking about within the cell\", 'when you look at each one of us since', 'each one of us is so different even', \"though there's a general like execution\", 'and blueprint we all come out so', 'different. Is that part of the process', 'that you are looking at and mapping? I I', 'would say to a jellyfish we all look', \"identical. True. Okay. They're not\", 'saying oh is your skin color slightly', 'different or you slightly taller. Yes.', \"You're describing functions at a\", 'cellular level. Is your job to', 'understand that or is your job to figure', 'out extra ways to fold proteins that', 'maybe biology has yet to even figure out', 'that can then solve problems that we', 'encounter that the natural universe has', 'not. So, oh that was a good question.', \"So, you're happy with yourself today? So\", 'happy with yourself. So happy with', 'myself today. Yeah. This is really', 'interesting. We we have these little', 'molecular machines, these proteins and', 'we care about that 3D structure and how', 'they work for two reasons. One, we want', 'to understand, you know, how our cells', 'work because if something goes wrong', 'with that, which is the case for', 'disease, then we want to understand,', 'okay, where can we or where do we', 'actually need to go in and start fixing', 'that, right? And how we can stop it from', 'actually going wrong in the first place.', \"Exactly. Exactly. So, that that's one\", 'thing. And then when we think about,', 'okay, how can we go and fix that? What', \"we're actually saying when we're doing\", \"drug design, we're saying can we create\", 'another molecule that will come into the', 'cell and actually start modulating these', \"molecular machines, it's going this this\", 'drug molecule is going to actually', 'attach to this protein over here and', \"that's going to cause this protein to\", \"change shape for example and so it won't\", 'operate how it normally does or and so', 'we stop that protein working or we make', 'it work better. These are the sort of', 'things we do in kind of reminds me of', 'messenger RNA', 'vaccines that we develop for co Yeah.', \"You know, there's so many different\", 'types of molecular mechanisms that we', 'take advantage for for drug design. Wow.', 'Are the folding proteins generally', 'following a set pattern in the way that', \"they do fold and you're able to map them\", \"and when they misfold, that's when\", \"you're able to flag that up. Or have I\", 'just reinvented something or talked', 'rubbish? That would be cool. No, no,', \"you're you're you're on to something.\", 'So, so great. So you know like the I', 'mean the amazing thing is that we can', 'actually turns out predict how these', 'proteins fold. So they are so modeling', \"that yeah we're modeling that with deep\", \"learning with neural networks. That's\", 'what alphafold you know and all its', 'generations are all about. And um that', 'means that we can actually just take in', 'a sequence of amino acids knowing', 'nothing about this protein before and', 'then get out the 3D structure. And', 'normally this would take people months', 'if not years to work out this 3D', 'structure. So, how is it that AlphaFold', 'knows how a large molecule wants to', \"fold? Again, it's got to know that in\", \"some way. It it's it's learned this from\", 'a few hundred,000 examples. So,', 'chemists, biochemists over the last 50', \"years, they've been working out these\", \"protein structures by hand. They've been\", 'literally synthesizing protein,', 'crystallizing it, then shooting X-rays', 'at this to like look at the electron', 'scattering and from that you can resolve', \"the protein structure. It's it's a\", 'pretty hard process, but people have', \"been doing that. That's your way to\", 'photograph what the shape of the', \"molecule. That's a way to photograph in\", \"reality with the with that kind of it's\", 'basically an electron microscope at that', \"level. Yeah. Similar. It's like electron\", 'scattering. Yeah. Exactly. And so people', 'have been doing that for the last 50', 'years and depositing these structures.', \"And now we've taken all of that data and\", 'trained a neural network to go just from', 'the input of what is this molecule', 'description to try and predict all of', 'that data. Right? And the amazing thing', 'is and this this is really remarkable is', 'that you can then train this on the last', \"50 years of data. That's a couple of\", 'hundred thousand protein and', 'biomolelecular systems. But you can', 'apply it seemingly to everything we know', 'about in the protein universe in the', 'proteome. It has proteeration', \"with its predictions because AI's been\", \"around a little while as you've already\", \"said and you're not the only AI tool\", \"that's out there but how accurate is\", 'this particular tool? Yes. So, so', 'Alphold 2, right, was that big jump', 'where we started to get experimental', 'level accuracy for just proteins and', \"that's what won the Nobel Prize. So, you\", 'balance it off against empirical', 'experiment. The benchmark is doing the', 'real lab work itself, right? So, Alpha 2', 'reached that level. Now, AlphaFold 3', 'expands from just just proteins to', 'incorporate other biomolelecular types.', 'So proteins with other proteins,', \"proteins with DNA, with RNA, with what's\", 'called small molecules, which are the', 'neighborhood, they start mixing all that', 'up. Or maybe not the neighborhood. Maybe', 'that neighborhood gets a little bit of', 'an upgrade.', \"No, that's that's when you make the\", 'superhuman so', \"it's not going to be the Terminator.\", \"It's going to be the superhuman. And\", \"then they're going to be like us and\", \"they're going to look down on us and go,\", 'you know, why do we need you guys? And', \"that's it. So anyway, you're able to\", 'predict these and has have you actually', 'taken any of the modeled predictions and', 'made the proteins? Yeah. Oh yeah. Or or', 'tell us where you expect these to lead', 'to new and innovative drugs cuz', \"otherwise it's just a it's just a puzzle\", \"exercise. Yeah. It's a great Lego set.\", 'Lego set.', 'We want the guests to enjoy this. Yeah.', 'It\\'s like, \"Oh my god, how much that', 'Lego set cost?\" Only $10 billion.', '[Laughter]', 'Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so', 'if you take a particular disease and we', 'we, you know, we we we think that we can', 'actually, you know, solve this disease', 'by modulating a particular protein. Mhm.', 'The question is how we do that. So, we', 'design a drug molecule and we want it to', 'fit to this protein in a certain way.', 'Oh. And so this is where traditionally', 'you would have to actually either just', 'guess or go into', 'crystallize each one of those', 'combinations and then photograph them', 'and see if it worked. But now you can', 'model it and the AI can do a thousand of', \"those in like a minute. Isn't this what\", 'you call the target target proteins?', \"Yes. Wow. So if you know you've got a\", 'certain target protein, do you not then', 'run that against a list of drugs and', 'think this one drug A works better with', \"this or maybe it's drug D or whichever\", \"letter of the alphabet you're on and now\", 'we become the sort of detective and has', 'this Alpha Fold 3 produced how many', 'clues and how many answers or are we', 'still grappling? Yeah. Instead of trying', 'to figure out the drug, the AI actually', 'figures out the drug for you. Drug', 'discovery. Well, exactly. You know, if', 'you let the guy speak, we might hear the', \"the two of you. Okay. We're figuring out\", 'this whole industry ourselves, Gary.', 'Yes. Yeah. You know, this is exactly', \"what where it's going. So, right, we can\", 'start actually rationally designing', 'these drugs, right? Traditionally, you', 'would take, you know, a million random', 'molecules and you would just throw them', 'at these proteins and see what sticks.', \"And and and that's how so many drugs\", 'have been created historically. Yeah.', \"you you go back further and you're\", 'sifting through mud to find these sort', \"of molecules. This is why there's been\", 'such a a low percentage of success rates', 'with the sort of drugs for whatever the', \"problem is. That's part of it because,\", \"you know, we we we we don't necessarily\", 'understand how these molecules are', 'working. M but with something like', 'Alphaold 3 you can you know put the', 'molecule put the target protein into the', 'system into the into the neural network', 'and you get out the 3D structure and as', 'a chemist you can start to understand', 'okay how is it this small molecule drug', 'modulating this protein now still the', 'problem is well how do you find that', \"small molecule in the first place that's\", 'going to be good for this protein you', \"know it's estimated there's like 10 to\", 'the^ of 60 possible drug-like molecules', \"out there that's you know 10 with 60\", 'zeros is so even people know what 10 to', 'the 16 yeah', \"so don't be rude\", 'even if you had the perfect alpha fold', \"you'd have to run that across 10 ^ the^\", '60 molecules which is just', \"computationally impossible it's\", 'unfeasible right until quantum computing', 'until', 'and so then what we need is is something', 'that we call a generative model or an', 'agent which is able to actually search', 'through that space understand that', 'entire entire molecular space and come', 'up with molecule designs for you. Oh,', 'cuz the 10 to the 60 is if you just did', 'it randomly. Exactly. Right. Right. But', 'just throwing it out anyway. Right.', \"Right. If you don't do it randomly, then\", 'you can Yeah. But but but randomly is', 'the state-of-the-art method, right? That', \"That's how people do it. It's how people\", \"currently do it. That's how people\", 'currently do it. Well, he call it', \"state-of-the-art. You're the state of\", \"the art. Well, thank you. Let's let's\", 'use the word properly here. So what if', 'what if the protein turns left when', \"you've predict when you've mapped it to\", 'turn right. Is that when we have issues', 'that even Alpha Fold 3 has a problem', 'with? Exactly. These are uh not perfect', \"models at the end of the day. They're\", 'very very accurate, but they will make', 'some mistakes. So you still do currently', 'need to go into the lab occasionally,', 'but the amount of lab work you have to', 'do is so much less, right, than and and', 'you and often you can find the area of', 'molecular space where these these models', 'work, you know, really really well. And', 'we then go out to the lab later down the', 'line, we crystallize these things and we', 'see, yeah, like this is a perfect', 'mapping of what the model predicted.', 'All right. So, back to an earlier point.', 'Yeah. In the old days, like last month,', 'you the the pharmaceutical companies,', 'big pharma, would spend millions, maybe', 'not quite a billion, hundreds of', 'millions of dollars developing a drug.', 'We think that, holding aside what might', 'be abuses of pricing, the fact that it', \"there's some truth to this first pill\", 'Mhm. cost $50 million. The second pill', 'cost 10 cents because they had to', 'research to get the formula for that', 'first pill. If you have narrow the', 'search space, then the cost of', 'developing that first pill can be', 'manifold smaller. I mean, it costs on', 'average $3 billion to create a new drug.', \"Wow. That's that's that's that's on\", \"average. Yeah. And so yeah, there's a\", 'that was low when I said hundred', 'billion. You were lowballing was', 'lowballing it. Okay. Um, so this is a', 'massive opportunity to like completely', 'change just like the cost, the speed,', 'the business model, the efficacy and the', 'business model as we do that. Is it', \"proprietary? So here's my real cuz\", \"here's where you would revolutionize. So\", \"if I come up with it and I'm I'm company\", \"A, right? It's mine and I get to\", \"determine everything. If you're an AI\", \"company and you're just doing this,\", \"okay, so that you can sell it, then it's\", 'yours. Which one will be will make', 'prices lower for the consumer? Our goal', 'is to is to like really redefine this', 'way you do drug design so it becomes so', 'much cheaper. We have so much more', 'abundance of potential drugs and', 'chemical matter that it really does', 'change the business model and it changes', 'the economics of the space. So you can', 'actually revolutionize', 'the the cost of making drugs. Yeah,', \"that's that's where we're going. That's\", \"where we're going. All right. is one of\", 'satisfied is one of the next steps with', \"alpha fold whichever it's three or maybe\", 'the next iteration or so going to', 'investigate why and what drives the', 'misfolding of a protein so as you can', 'kind of get ahead of even the story of', 'that happening. Wow. So so actually the', 'misfolding of a protein is another thing', \"that that's what causes some types of\", \"disease. Yeah. where you'll have a\", 'genetic mutation, a mutation in your DNA', 'which will change a particular amino', \"acid in that protein and so it doesn't\", 'fold the normal way it should fold and', \"so it doesn't function as as it normally\", 'should as a molecular machine and so', 'things like alphafold can help us', 'understand what are those mutations that', \"cause misfolding they're called\", 'misssense mutations right and then you', 'know these could be potential drug', 'targets so we could you know think about', 'molecules that could you know mitigate', 'against that if I understand correctly', 'If you look at the the PDR, it is this', \"thick. And what's PDR? The physician's\", 'desk reference. Thank you. Uh is this', \"thick. So it's the size of an old style\", \"Manhattan phone book. Okay. It's very\", \"thick, multiple inches across. And it's\", 'chalk full of existing medicines', 'available to the doctor to prescribe. Is', 'it true that 100% of those medicines are', 'interacting with the patient chemically', 'rather than through protein folding?', \"So that if that's the case, does that\", 'mean that where proteins misfold, we', \"can't combat it with any kind of folding\", 'algorithm? We just prescribe', 'chemistry for your body to handle the', 'impact of that. Is that did I say any of', 'that right? I think that that that is', 'the majority of drugs. They are they are', 'chemicals that we take. We are we you', 'know chemical is not going to fix the', \"fold. It's going to treat the symptoms\", 'of the of the misfolding that happen.', \"We're not we're not changing the\", 'mutations of the proteins. That that', 'could be something like gene therapy. Um', 'but these are these are chemicals that', 'come in and will attach themselves to', 'these proteins and somehow mitigate the', 'you know something like a misfold or', \"it'll change an interface change how\", 'these molecular machines work.', \"That's why is there a particular disease\", 'isomorphic labs are focusing upon right', 'now or is this a more of a broad', \"spectrum? Let's do let's let's go for\", 'proteins and cherry pick out certain', 'things or we really looking at one', \"particular the technology we're creating\", \"it's really really general. We want to\", 'be able to apply this drug design engine', 'on any protein any target any disease', 'area that comes our way. Now saying that', 'you know practically as a company and', 'and you want to focus on a particular', \"area we're focusing at the moment on you\", 'know a lot on cancer course and a lot on', 'immunology of course two biggies and the', 'two that probably lend themselves best', \"to what you're trying to accomplish\", \"actually. Okay. The question everyone's\", \"going to want me to ask right now that's\", 'watching this and listening to this is', 'how you getting on?', \"Would I mean it's going really well to\", \"be honest. um we're seeing these\", 'algorithms actually, you know, change', \"the way that we're able to do drug\", \"design. We're able to discover, you\", 'know, completely novel chemical matter', 'against some of these targets that, you', 'know, people have been working on for,', 'you know, even over a decade, right? So,', 'really, really hard stuff. Making', 'amazing progress. Still still really', \"early in the company, but um it's super\", 'exciting. And have you sent anything to', 'be photographed yet?', 'We we we we sent some things for for', 'molecular photographs. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.', \"Yeah. I know you're not allowed to talk\", \"about it. I know. I get it. But we're\", 'all very happy. Okay. There you go.', \"That's Listen, I'm I'm with you. I'm\", \"picking up what you're putting down.\", \"That's cool. Yeah. But so if you if you\", 'I see this work as fundamental research', 'so that you publish a result, you', 'publish the image as they published the', 'image of the DNA molecule to know that', 'it was a double helix. That becomes', 'public knowledge at that point. So', 'someone with tools access to AlphaFold', '3, would any company have access to this', 'once you have published the blueprint', 'for it? In in drug design, often these', 'blueprints come out in the patents. So', \"when you're when you're going to go into\", 'clinical trial, you need to patent these', \"molecules and in those patents, you'll\", 'have a lot of data around the molecules,', 'the formula, how they work. I was', 'talking about earlier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.', 'Okay. Yeah. All right. So the', 'immune system, the the cancer Mhm. These', 'are leading causes of malades in this', 'world. What of the genetic disorders', 'that affect one in 100,000 people? Wow.', \"You you bring them together, there's\", \"enough of them, you know, they'll fill a\", \"stadium in the world, but that's so\", 'uncommon as to not really trigger', \"anybody's interest. Yeah. It's also not\", \"profitable because you don't have you\", \"don't have enough of a market there to\", \"sell the drug. I mean, you know, it's\", \"exactly that that point, Chuck. It's um\", 'traditionally it might not be that', 'attractive commercially to go after, you', 'know, very small patient populations.', \"But in a world where it's so much\", 'cheaper, so much easier to get to these', 'drug molecules, then that opens up like', 'all of this space. The cheaper it is,', 'the the easier you can justify going', 'down that risk. Down the risk list. And', 'this is a big guiding star for us. Like', \"that's this is why we're doing this.\", \"That's beautiful. I see what you did\", 'there. Guiding star. Yeah. You know, it', \"would be great though. He's picked up in\", \"the environment. He's not sitting. How's\", \"chief AI officer? Yeah. I'm interested\", 'to how active the company is in shaping', \"policy around what you're doing because\", \"there's going to be a great deal of\", 'legislative policy that is going to be', \"tied to what you're doing. All the\", \"patent implications, there's going to\", 'be, you know, research implications.', 'There going to be a lot of things tied', \"to this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've\", 'been talking in this conversation about', \"drug design, but then once you've\", \"designed the drug, you've got to go into\", \"patients in clinical trials and that's a\", 'really long process. Yeah. Which is why', 'we have mice. But even these mice', \"models, they're not actually very\", 'predictive. Like you do all these', \"studies in mice and then they don't, you\", \"know, it doesn't translate into success\", 'in people, right? You got to go up the', 'evolutionary scale and then get to the', 'human bit. Yeah. Exactly. And so', \"there's, you know, you can imagine a\", 'world where we can design loads of new', \"drugs. we've got to be changing the way\", \"that we're doing clinical trials, you\", 'know, how we can actually get these', 'drugs to patients who really really need', 'them in a timely manner. Um, so I think', \"there's a lot to be done and like\", 'rethought that rethought that is the', 'ultimate goal for AlphaFold and I think', 'medical science as a whole to be able to', 'bespoke medication for you as the', 'individual rather than the broader', 'spectrum medication that we find', 'ourselves with all the side effects. So,', 'are you able to then design a drug or a', 'medication that has zero side effects', 'and works exactly for me? This is the', \"goal, right? This is this is what we're\", 'shooting for. You know, imagine a world', 'where we can sequence your particular', 'cancer mutations, right? And then based', 'on those your individual mutations be', 'generating specific drugs for you,', 'right? That even these are like, you', 'know, 3D printed or something around the', \"corner. Okay. Yeah. This is um we're not\", \"there yet, right? We're in the very nent\", 'stages of that right now with the', 'imunotherapy for cancer treatments and', 'but how many of these yet to be cured', 'diseases lend themselves to solutions', 'that involve protein folding and how', 'many are just plain old oldfashioned', 'chemistry. Proteins make up like pretty', 'much all of our molecular machinery. So', \"there's there's a class of disease which\", \"is due to misfolding but then there's\", 'many many other diseases which are due', 'to for example a protein not being', 'expressed properly or you know a cell', 'going wrong in a certain tissue. If I', 'have a bacterial infection I give myself', \"antibacterial chemicals and then I'm\", 'done. Do I need you for that? But those', 'chemicals are interacting with the', 'proteins in the bacteria. Okay. So', 'proteins are the fundamental machinery', 'and the chemicals which are drugs are', \"modulating those proteins whether it's\", 'like in our cells in bacteria. All', \"right. So it's basically everything\", \"you're talking about is it's all\", 'happening on the cellular level. If what', \"you're describing is happening inside of\", 'cells, proteins doing their thing, the', '3D jigsaw puzzle and you have a solution', 'for that a remedy. You have to get your', 'remedy inside the cell to interact with', 'that folding the delivery system. And', 'how do you do that other than through', 'like a Trojan horse virus or something?', 'Cuz viruses get in there pretty uh on', 'command. Yeah. Well, if you think about', 'the drugs that you take as pills, drug', \"design is really hard because it's not\", 'just about targeting these proteins. We', 'got to get them to the right place. We', 'might want a pill that you take. So you', \"take this pill, it's got to be absorbed\", \"by the body. So it's got to be soluble,\", \"right? It's got to go through the gut\", \"wall. It's got to go through the\", 'bloodstream to the particular tissue', 'type, the cell type you care about. then', \"it's got to go through the cell membrane\", 'to be able to actually target maybe a', 'target which is within the cell. So you', 'need all of these properties in a single', \"molecule. So we're actually designing\", 'these molecules not just to hit the', 'protein but also to be soluble to be', \"cell permeable. There's so many\", \"different factors and then you don't\", 'want this molecule to be toxic. So you', 'want it to hit the target of interest', 'but not hit anything else. So I can see', 'how a molecule gets through the cell', 'wall. Yeah. a simple molecule, but a a', 'fullup protein, red-blooded protein,', \"how's that getting through the cell\", \"wall? Exactly. There's different types\", 'of drugs. Some are what we call small', 'molecules, things you could take as', 'pills. Others are made from proteins', \"there. They're often things that you\", 'would inject directly inside. So you um', 'and some of those might be cell', 'permeable. They would be things like', 'peptides, but often these these protein', 'based drugs, things like antibodies, uh', \"they're injected, but they don't go in\", \"the cell. they're just interacting with\", 'proteins on the surface of cells. So,', \"you don't need that permeability. So, it\", 'really depends on what your target is', 'and how do you want people to be able to', 'take that drug. Sometimes a pill is the', 'best thing, but actually sometimes', 'injecting is the best thing. Yes. And', 'remind me what a peptide is. A peptide', 'is a really small protein. Um, so you', 'got full-blown proteins which are these', \"big molecular machines and then you've\", 'got small proteins um made up of, you', 'know, five to 50 amino acids. Those are', \"peptides. Those are peptides. They're\", 'smaller. So in sometimes in some', 'configurations they can get through the', 'cell wall.', 'So with this computer science are we', \"upending chemistry as we've known it and\", 'are we going to find it kind of moving', 'off even with AI with the AI is it then', 'sort of moving into the other sciences?', 'Are we going to just see it stick in one', 'particular area? Chemistry is always', \"going to exist. It's it it it's like I\", \"to me it's like any field of science at\", 'the moment doing science like chemistry', \"without maths.

Once you model, Mhm. the next', \"step is creating. Yeah, that's true.\", \"That's all there is to it. That's true.\", \"That that's the dream. We kind of need\", 'to work up the scales here. So, you', 'know, we we we can model how two atoms', 'interact. We can write down those', 'equations. We can simulate small atomic', 'systems. With things like alpha fold, we', 'get into bigger atomic systems, things', 'on the scale of like multiple proteins.', \"Now we've got very very accurate alpha\", '3. Maybe we can actually bootstrap off', 'that to get to more sort of even bigger', 'systems, what we call pathways, how all', \"of these things interact. It's only just\", 'now clicking within me because you can', 'look up in a book the tables of um', 'action potentials for the interactions', \"of of atoms and molecules. And so you'd\", 'have a very good sense of which', 'molecules will combine. Is it', 'exothermic? Is it endothermic? But these', 'are atoms and molecules. And as powerful', \"and as convenient as that is, that's\", 'just the first rung in this ascending', 'ladder of complexity that you are', \"gaining control over. Yeah. And there's\", \"there's trillions of atoms within a\", 'single cell, let alone the whole human', \"body, right? It's just unfeasible to\", 'simulate the whole thing. But what you', 'can do is you can, you know, we do have', 'good measurement techniques at different', 'levels of scale. So we can measure', 'things like protein folding. We can', 'measure the amount of protein within a', 'cell. We can measure the number of cells', 'of certain type within a tissue. And so', 'we have these the bigger it is, the', 'easier it would be to measure. So we', 'have these little windows into this sort', 'of microscopic world. And then we can', 'use AI to sort of fill in the gaps and', 'bootstrap off the stuff we can do well', 'the the atomic level and start building', 'up that scale of modeling. If that makes', 'it I read this article like god knows', 'how long ago. God, how long did read the', 'article? Because you know, God', 'anyway, it was talking about when a', 'fertilized cell starts to uh proliferate', 'and become a person. And basically what', 'it determined, what the scientists', 'determined at that point, and this is', 'many years ago, is that the only way', \"that could describe it is there's a\", \"bunch of noise. Like there's just a\", \"bunch of noise. We can't really see\", \"anything. We can't make sense of any of\", \"it because it's just basically if we\", 'were to look at it as data it would just', 'be noise. Are you able to pierce that', 'veil and see into that? I mean we we', \"haven't been looking at that specific\", 'thing. Okay. But this is where you start', 'to understand more about you know a', 'really granular scale and then you you', 'can integrate that and create these sort', \"of I don't know coarser measurements and\", 'and coarser predictions. This is what we', 'do in in lots of areas of science,', \"right? We we don't simulate the whole\", 'universe at the atomic scale, but we we', 'find these rules of thumb or ways to', 'describe sort of broader collections of', \"molecules and that's what we can start\", 'to build up and actually learn with', 'these neural networks. Cool.', 'So, question on behalf of Chuck. Could', 'Alpha discover a hallucinogenic that', 'could make him see God', 'or any other deity or being? Thank you', 'for asking. Welcome. I would like a very', 'real answer, please.', 'You You can go on the Alphael server and', 'try that out. Okay. All right.', \"Invitation. Hey, listen. I'm all about\", \"it. So, we've looked at in previous\", 'shows talking to Biome Medical', 'Engineering.

So, what is the', 'connection between wanting to modify a', 'genome and your ability to fold proteins', 'to interact with our physiology? I asked', \"that because I'm reminded there was a\", 'scene in the film Gatka where they they', \"didn't manipulate your genome, but they\", 'selected your pre-existing genome for', \"certain properties.

Can is it even possible', 'to consider that without considering the', 'whole area itself as it all bleeds in', 'together at some point? Yeah, I mean we', 'need to understand the genome and and', 'all the effect how how you how changing', 'a particular base pair on your DNA is', 'going to change you know what proteins', 'are expressed or in what abundance and', 'how that all the knock on effect on the', 'pathways. you you really want this like', 'basically this virtual cell to be able', 'to manipulate this cell on a computer', \"right to do experiments there here's\", 'what I want you like your cell template', 'that you talking about prioritizing and', \"I'm not asking much because it already\", 'happens in the animal kingdom you know', 'for so long decades even centuries we', 'imagined ourselves at the top of some', 'evolutionary yeah tri', 'without any arrogance whatsoever yeah', 'and all right Yet a noot can regenerate', \"a limb and we can't. Yeah. And so it\", \"seems to and they're vertebrates. So it\", 'seems to me there ought to be some way', 'to extract from animals that do things', 'that we could benefit from and then make', 'that a priority.

Now if you had a', 'quantum computer that could work on that', 'scale you could use that instead. So wow', 'I think of so many needs on the frontier', 'of chemistry in modern society. Uh one', 'of them is you know what do we do with', \"all the plastic that's in our\", \"environment that's still there in the\", 'ocean. Is there some life form you can', \"create that'll digest the plastic and\", 'turn it back into its original', 'molecules? Is are proteins something', 'that could be applied there?

If you're\", \"molten and you're heavy, you're going to\", \"sink. Sink, right? You're going to sink.\", 'Okay.

I'm just going\", 'to Mark a word in in your comment which', 'is the word you like who who is the you', 'here which you and and and how should we', 'think about those different use and some', 'of the things I think about when I do', 'think about this question I think', \"there's um discovery of basic knowledge\", 'like fundamental underlying phenomena of', 'the universe we split the atom that was', 'basic knowledge and I see that as a', 'different Enterprise than the', 'engineering Enterprise of tools and', \"technologies that we're going to deploy\", \"in society I'm with you then so I am a\", 'strong proponent of um very very diverse', 'scientific exploration in fact I', 'actually would claim that you know as a', 'country in the United States our um', 'scientific exploration is far more', 'narrow than what I would like to see and', 'I would really push hard so based on', \"what you just said all right here's an\", \"ethical question there's a scientist who\", 'discovers a cure

'return to that okay because I also want', \"to say to Neil's comment you know we\", 'have limited um time and resources so it', 'is always the circumstance that we are', 'choosing to do some things and not do', \"other things so it's it's really a\", 'choice of where am I going to direct my', 'time and energy where am I going to um', 'place my imaginative energies and', 'Innovation and which ones am I not going', 'to do right and we saw in the 80s for', 'example a real push of resources towards', 'the development of nuclear energy and', 'away from', 'photovoltaics right so we live in that', \"kind of resource I don't know if you\", 'would call it resource scarce but at', \"least we don't get to work on everything\", 'at full force all at the same time and', 'we have to recognize we are making', 'choices so one of the first things I', 'would say is um how do we make really', 'good choices there how do we use the', 'resources we have in a way that will be', 'most constructive for us my own gestal', 'on that is on the basic science side of', 'things I say spread those resources', 'across a wide diversity of different', 'kinds of Science and um different kinds', 'of ideas far more diverse than what I', 'think we tend to do in the United States', 'and on the engineering side and now', 'maybe I shift bat Chuck to your question', \"which is really a great question I don't\", 'tend to see the world in terms of forc', 'choices or design tradeoffs in the way', 'that you framed it I want to bring back', 'in that notion of constraint and I want', 'to bring back in

we push hard enough on', 'ourselves we will be able to invent ways', 'that use that knowledge without having', 'to also risk a really deadly virus and I', 'think the propensity to', \"say it's a tradeoff it's X or\", 'Y we really limit ourselves in our', 'abilities so in the work that we do we', 'have moved away from the language of', 'design tradeoff or value conflict and we', 'talk about

'brilant great great answer and', \"insightful and great that's actually\", \"been done many times before uh just it's\", 'a slight tangent to your line of work', \"but it's it's related when they used to\", 'do crash tests right with pigs right', 'because you can get a hog that has sort', 'of same sort of body mass as a human put', \"him in the driver's seat crash the car\", \"and the hog dies

and then we have the crash', 'test dummy yeah and the crash test dumm', 'is even better than the because you can', 'put sensors everywhere throughout and so', \"that's that so I I agree not perfect but\", 'better yeah yes', 'or or even maybe better and perfect', \"right I I agree that it's a false choice\", 'to say I can only do this if I possibly', 'set loose a virus that kills an entire', \"country well then maybe you're not\", 'clever enough and keep at it I was', 'clever enough to kill a whole country no', \"I'm\", 'joking okay I have one last thing and', 'before we wrap one last

want to remind us all about is', 'that you know moral philosophers have', 'been trying to identify a workable', 'ethical theory that cuts across all', 'situations all times and we have some', 'really good ideas but none of them cover', 'all the situations that our intuitions', 'tell us about so sometimes a', 'consequentialist theory is good but it', \"comes up short and then there's a rights\",

'that we just have to accept is that um', \"while we're waiting to figure that out\", 'from a conceptual ethical moral point of', 'view we still live in the world and we', 'still need to act in the world and so', \"the work that I've done has tried to\", 'take that really seriously to create a', 'space for ethical Theory without um', 'explicitly saying which ethical Theory', 'and also leaving room for as we learn', \"more that we can bring that in so that's\", \"a little background to what you're\", 'saying so now what does value sensitive', \"design do for the circumstance you're\", 'talking about it puts a Line in the Sand', 'and says you have to engage with all', 'stakeholders direct and indirect who are', 'going to be implicated by your', 'technology that means that not only do', 'the people who want to benefit from', \"somebody else's labor not only are they\", 'stakeholders but those people who are', 'laboring are stakeholders and value', 'sense of design says they are

years ago', 'right so these are these are about', 'practice this is about practice and', 'about implementing these practice and so', \"I'm going to tell you a story about a\", 'project a very particular project and', \"you'll see why and how this actually\", \"matters and is practical it's not pie in\", 'the sky so in the state of Washington', 'where I live there is something called', 'the access to Justice technology', 'principles that govern how the courts um', 'give access to technology what they are', 'required to do and they were first', 'developed maybe 15 years ago 20 years', 'ago and then they wanted to update', 'them and the committee that updated them', 'came to my lab and they said you know', \"we've done a good job updating them but\", \"we don't feel like we've really reached\", 'out to diverse groups of people can you', 'help', 'us my lab developed a method called the', 'diverse voices process for Tech policy', 'and the idea is that you know the hits', 'the road with the words on the page so', 'if we take a tech', 'policy in its sort of polished draft', 'form and we can let groups that might', 'otherwise be marginalized scrutinize', 'that language give feedback and then we', 'can help change those policies', 'responsive to them then we can improve', 'things so we did we ran panels with', 'people who were formally incarcerated we', 'ran them with uh immigrants we ran them', 'with people in rural communities and we', 'actually ran them with um the people who', 'do the court administration because', \"they're also really key\", 'stakeholders as a result of the work we', 'did there were two principles that were', 'surfaced one was about human touch and', 'the other was about language and people', 'said to us things like look if somebody', \"is going to deny me parole and I'm not\", 'going to get to be there for my kids', '13th birthday or hang out with them at', 'at you know their soccer games you can', 'relate to that right Gary thank you um I', 'want a human being to look me in the eye', \"and tell me that that's what my life is\", 'going to be for the next year because my', \"peole is denied I don't want to hear\", \"that from an AI I don't want to hear\", 'that from uh a piece of technology I', 'want a human being to tell me that', 'because this is a human experience right', 'and so so in fact we gave that feedback', 'back to the committee the committee then', 'added in new principles actually around', 'human touch and those were approved by', 'the Washington state supreme court a', 'couple of years ago and those access to', 'technology principles are a model that', 'many states in the United States follow', \"so what I'm talking about is really\", \"practical and we're talking about how we\", 'actually improve things in practice be', 'it on the technology design side or on', 'the policy side that governs how the', 'technology is used and I love the fact', 'that a state can do that independently', 'from the federal government and be so', 'good at it or so emulat that other', 'states will then use that as the model', 'and then that can spread across the', 'country with or without Federal guidance', 'on top of it yeah excellent well I guess', 'if I was going to say one one last thing', \"it's you know because we have perhaps\", 'stumbled in the past', \"that's no reason to think we need to\", 'stumble in the future or stumble in the', 'same way you know so really my takeaway', 'to everyone would be hold on to your', 'Technical and moral imaginations and', 'hold yourselves and your friends and', 'your colleagues um and the technology', 'you buy accountable to that and we will', 'make progress some incremental and some', 'perhaps much bigger but that as a as a', 'keystone I think is is

yes there's not enough it seems to\", \"me there's not whatever he did there's\", 'not enough of them in the world I', \"believe if we're thinking about the\", \"ethics of AI That's on everybody's mind\", 'right now I mean for Steve welcome to', 'Star talk thank you very much yeah so uh', 'for those who can see this on video uh', \"you're Dawning an ey patch and you said\", 'you had recent surgery but none of us', \"none of us believe we we're not buying\", \"it we think you're training for the next\", \"Bond villain yes that's that's very\", \"appropriate for the topic we're going to\", 'discuss you know autonomous systems AI', 'mid ey patch ouch W equals Bond villain', \"there's the equation so where are we now\", 'with establishing AI ethics because the', \"AI it's it's Delights some people myself\", 'included it freaks out other people and', \"we're all at some level thinking about\", 'the ethical invocation of it before AI', 'becomes our Overlord so what what is the', 'current status of that right', \"now well I think we're right on the edge\", 'of some very important developments and', \"very important human decisions uh I've\", 'been working working in AI for 40 years', 'and for the first half of that I thought', \"AI was an unabashed good we'd cure\", \"cancer we'd you know solve Fusion all\", 'the basic human problems we would solve', 'with AI but then about 20 years ago I', 'started thinking more deeply about well', \"what's this actually going to happen\", \"when if we succeed what's going to\", 'happen when AIS can really reason about', 'what they want to do and I discovered', 'that um there are these things I call', 'the basic AI drives uh which are things', 'that basically any AI which has uh', 'simple goals and I used to think about', 'Chess playing AIS uh will want to do and', 'some of those are get more resources so', 'it can do more of what it wants to do', 'make copies of itself keep itself from', 'being turned off or changed and so those', 'things in the context of the human world', 'are very risky and very dangerous uh we', \"didn't have the AIS 20 years ago that\", \"could do that but we're about to have\", 'those in the next probably year or two', 'so this is a critical moment for', 'Humanity I would say so where do you', 'stand on this on the subject of', 'Consciousness engineering those that', 'want to engineer AI for Consciousness', \"and those that want to not what's the\", 'benefit the good or bad here is that the', 'difference between a blunt computer that', 'serves our needs and one that thinks', 'about the problems you are the', 'self-improving algorithms all sort of', 'things like that yeah exactly well I', 'think long term you know we we may very', 'well want to go there in the short term', \"I think we're nowhere close to being\", 'able to handle that kind of a system so', 'I would say you know if you made me you', 'know king of the world uh we limit Kurt', 'AIS to being tools only tools to help', 'humans solve human problems and we do', 'not give them agency we do not allow', 'them to take over you know large systems', \"it's not easy necessarily to do that\", 'because many of these systems will want', 'to take over things and so we need', 'technology to keep them limited and', \"that's what what I'm thinking a lot\", \"about right now in my field it's exactly\", \"I mean we've been enjoying AI for a long\", \"long for a long time and it's been a\", \"tool it's not and a brilliant beautiful\", 'tool makes our lives easier uh and uh', \"once they're trained we we go to the\", \"beach while it does the work and I'm\", \"good with that uh but yeah we're not\", 'working with AI with agency yeah because', 'then it would be like so how was the', \"beach no that's AI with attitude I hope\", 'you enjoyed', 'yourself while I was here slaving away', 'over my calculations AI with Attitude', 'yeah so if if we do have ai with agency', 'and then we continue to use it as just a', 'toll do we not get legal on the phone', \"and all of a sudden we're into contracts\", 'and oh yeah big problems you know can', 'they vote can they own property right', 'and the latest models are have been', 'discovered that they do do they do', 'something called siop Fancy which is', \"they're trained to try and give\", 'responses that people rate as good', 'well AI very quickly discover that if', 'you say that was a brilliant question', 'you must be an amazing person then', 'people say yeah that was a really good', \"response and so they'll just make up all\", \"kinds of stuff like that so they're\", 'ass-kissing well they know that we love', 'that exactly so where does it stand now', 'today is there a table you should be', \"sitting at where you're not as we go\", 'forward on this Frontier yeah I mean so', \"so who's going to make these decisions\", 'well it has to be somebody who', 'understands the technology who', 'understands the technology the companies', 'do and so open AI Deep Mind anthropic', 'and the Elon Musk xai is sort of an', 'emerging one these are the companies', 'that are building these systems at the', 'Leading Edge they call them Frontier', \"models and because they're the ones who\", \"know what's going on they're the ones\", 'making these decisions now the', 'government has recently realized oh my', 'goodness we better get involved with', 'this and so there have been a lot of', 'Partnerships announced over the last few', 'few months actually between governmental', 'agencies intelligence agencies defense', 'agencies and these Leading Edge AI', 'companies and so I think some kind of a', 'new combination is emerging out of that', \"that's going to make the actual end end\", 'decisions so how do you incentivize', 'these these tech companies to embrace', 'the safety architecture and not go', 'gung-ho and disappear off on their own', 'agendas that is the Big Challenge and if', \"we look at the history of open AI it's a\", 'little bit of a cautionary tale it was', 'created I think around 2017 in response', \"to Google's Deep Mind which was making\", 'great progress at the time right and a', 'group of people said oh my God we really', 'have to worry about AI safety it looks', \"like this is happening quickly let's\", 'start a special company which is', 'nonprofit and which is particularly', 'focused on safety and they did that and', 'everything was great Elon Musk was one', 'of the forces behind it there were', 'internal struggles and so on and musk', 'left well when he left he took away some', 'of the money he was going to give them', 'so then they decided oh we need to make', 'money and so then they started becoming', 'more commercial and that process has', 'continued a group of the researchers', \"there said wait a minute you're not\", 'focusing on safety they left open aai', 'and they started in thropic to be even', 'more safety oriented and now anthropic', 'is also becoming much more commercial', 'and so the forces the commercial forces', 'the political forces the military forces', 'they all push in the direction of moving', 'faster', 'and you know get more advanced more', 'quickly whereas the safety everybody', 'wants safety but they sort of compete', 'against the these economic and political', 'forces I was in the U UAE a couple of', 'years ago and if I remember correctly', 'they have a minister of AI and as does', 'China and some other uh countries sort', 'of emergent on this space how do we get', 'that kind of ear and audience within our', 'own governmental system the military', \"does have an AI group that's about this\", 'absolutely as you would want them to', 'yeah but in terms of policy and laws and', 'legislation do we need a a Cabinet', \"member who's Secretary of AI or\", 'Secretary of computing something some', 'structural change yeah oh this is the', 'biggest change to humanity and to the', \"planet ever and it looks like it's\", 'happening you know sometime over the', 'next decade and many are predicting very', 'short timelines and so we as a species', 'humanity is not ready for this and so', 'how do we deal with it and people many', 'people are starting to wake up to that', 'fact and so there are lots and lots of', 'meetings and organizations and groups um', \"it's still pretty incoherent I would say\", \"so Steve if we if you've got this\", 'talking shop going on where something', 'may or may not get done are we misplaced', \"focusing exactly on AI when we've still\", 'got Quantum Computing on the horizon oo', 'good one yeah are we how much of this is', \"premature but won't they go hand in hand\", \"so it's like whatever whatever problems\", 'you have with AI and whatever', \"considerations you're making with AI\", \"you're just going to have to transfer\", 'them over to Quantum Magi so you should', 'really start dealing with it now but if', \"you're not in at the ground floor not in\", \"a tool well let's just Steve hit this go\", \"ahead Steve well so I'll give you an\", 'example so Quantum computing you know if', 'it were successful would break much of', \"the public key cryptography that's used\", 'in the world today and so nist has been', 'busily trying to create a postquantum', 'cryptography where they create new', \"algorithms which wouldn't be vulnerable\", 'to to Quantum Computing but uh meta for', 'example has a group which is using the', 'latest AI models to break these', \"postquantum uh algorithms and they've\", 'been successful at breaking some of them', 'and so like you say the two are going', 'hand inand AIS will be much better at', 'creating Quantum algorithms than humans', 'are and that may lead to some great', 'advances it may also lead to you know', 'current cryptography not not', \"withstanding that and so uh that's\", 'another whole wave of of uh', \"transformation that's likely to happen\", 'we we just make every password 1 two 3 4', \"no AI would ever go for that they' be\", 'like oh yes so', 'ridiculous and and listening to you', 'Steve it it reminds me was it Kurt vaget', \"in one of his stories I don't remember\", 'which he said these are the last words', 'ever spoken in the human species yes two', \"scientists saying let's try it this\", 'other', \"way that's the end yeah there you go and\", 'that was it', \"yeah let's let's try AI in this other\", \"mode right boom that's the end of the\", 'world right right there so you can set', \"ethical guidelines but that doesn't stop\", 'Bad actors out there no that means a bad', 'actor can take over the world while the', 'rest of us are obeying ethical guides so', 'what are the guard rails put in place', 'place for something like that I think', \"that's one of the greatest challenges we\", 'now have open source language models', 'open source AIS that are almost as', 'powerful as the the ones in the labs and', \"far more dangerous and uh and they're\", 'being downloaded hundreds of millions of', 'times and so you have to assume every', 'actor in the world now uh China is now', \"using uh meta's latest models for their\", 'military Ai and so I believe we need', 'Hardware uh controls to limit the the', 'capability of uh so right now the', 'biggest AIS require these gpus that are', 'quite expensive and quite large the the', \"latest one is the Nvidia h100 it's about\", '$30,000 for a chip yeah the US uh put an', 'embargo on selling those to China but', 'apparently China has found ways to get', 'the chips anyway um people are gathering', 'up these chips Gathering huge amounts of', 'money hundreds of well certainly', 'hundreds of millions of dollars billions', \"of dollars and now they're even talking\", 'about trillion doll data set over the', 'next few years and so the good news is', 'if it really costs a trillion dollars to', 'build the system that will host the', 'super duper AI then very few actors can', \"uh pay that and therefore it'll be\", 'limited in in its extent you just', 'described where the next Frontier of', 'warfare will exist yeah absolutely', \"absolutely one thing you know it's\", 'pretty obvious these data centers are', \"going to be a Target and they don't see\", 'to be building them in a very hardened', \"way so I think that's something people\", 'need just start thinking about maybe', 'underground data centers Steve are', 'we looking at something in terms of the', \"safety aspect here that's doable or are\", 'we just the kings of wishful thinking I', 'want to make sure we got the good the', 'good thoughts here yeah because I I', \"don't want to leave this conversation\", 'with you completely buming us out okay I', 'hope not to do that yeah yeah Steve give', 'us a place where we can say thank you', 'Steve for being on our show and be able', 'to sleep tonight yeah the truly safe', 'technology needs to be based on the laws', 'of physics and the law and the', 'mathematical proof those are the only', 'two things that we can be absolutely', \"sure can't be subverted by a\", 'sufficiently powerful Ai and um AIS are', 'getting very good at both of those', \"they're becoming able to model physical\", 'systems and design physical systems with', 'whatever characteristics we want uh and', \"they're also able to uh perform\", 'mathematical proof in a very good way', 'and so it looks to me like we can design', 'Hardware that puts constru on AIS um of', 'whatever form we want but that we need', 'AI to design this hardware and that if', \"we can shift Humanity's technological\", 'infrastructure you say AI please design', \"your own prison cell that we're going to\", \"put you in that's what you just said\", \"exactly it's all and then it's going to\", \"design way you certainly don't want an\", \"agent to do that because then they'll\", 'find some way to hide a backd door or', 'something but by using mathematical', 'proof we can get absolute guarantees of', 'about the properties of systems and', \"we're just on the verge of that kind of\", \"technology and so I'm very hopeful that\", 'probably the next two or three years uh', 'you know there are several groups who', 'are building um superhuman', \"mathematicians uh and they're expecting\", 'to be at the level of say human graduate', 'students and Mathematics by the end of', 'this year using those AIS uh we can', 'build designs for systems that have', 'properties that we are very very', \"confident in and so I think that's where\", 'real safety is going to come from uh but', 'it builds on top of AI so we need them', 'both I was going to say the good thing', 'about what you just said even though it', 'sounds crazy to have the inmate design', 'its own cell is that without agency at', \"this point it's just a drone carrying\", \"out an order yeah so that's that's the\", 'encouraging part you know so yeah', 'whereas if it were ceni in any way or if', 'it had some kind of agency it could very', \"well say yeah I'm also going to design a\", \"back door and the trap door and I'm not\", \"going to tell you and I'm not going to\", 'tell you Steve I first congratulations', 'on winning this award you are exactly', 'the right kind of person who deserves', 'such an award that gives us hope for the', 'future of our relationship with', 'technology yeah yes and the health and', 'wealth and security of civilization as', 'we go forward yeah so thank you so much', 'and I look forward to the day where an', 'AI beats you out for this award oh right', \"yeah we want that's a great point maybe\", \"next year it'll be an AI that\", \"wi I'm joking by the way Steve omah\", \"handro winner of this year's future of\", 'Life award award and deservedly so thank', 'you thank you

Which means sometimes we have', 'rosecolored glasses towards the past.', \"Yes. I get it. I get it. So here's how\", 'it works. Two scientists argue', \"there's a pact implicitly signed before\", 'they even begin, which is either', \"you're right and she's wrong, you're\", \"right and he's wrong, or you're both\", 'wrong.

Yeah. So,', \"so here's this was their This is their\", 'Tyson, Jake Paul. Real kind of', \"throwdown. So, let's go to the Harvard\", 'fellow. Yeah. Cuz you can always tell a', \"Harvard man, but you can't tell them\", 'much.', 'Oh, got it. Got it. So, they they were', 'insufferable back then as well. Got it.', 'Were they also like I went to school in', 'Boston?', 'you. Just say it. Just say it. So', \"say it, you know. I don't know. All\", \"right. So back to the here's what\", \"happened. Let's merch. Uh Shappley was\", 'heavily invested in the entire night sky', 'being part of the being the whole', 'universe and the Milky Way. and he had', 'evidence at the time from a fellow', 'astronomer who had looked at the spiral', 'nebula and claimed that he found them', 'having moved on the sky.', \"Now, if you're really really far away,\", \"that's essentially impossible to\", \"measure. But if you're close up and\", \"you're moving, you can see that\", 'movement. Okay? Things that are close to', 'you. So the example here is if I see a', 'plane moving across the sky and then I', 'see a bird moving at the same angle. I', \"don't conclude that the bird is going\", '600 mph the bird is much closer. So at', 'much lower speeds I can see it cross my', \"field of view. So because it's closer\", 'that evidence suggested that the spiral', 'nebula were nearby and he he bet on that', 'horse but it was the wrong horse.', 'He he was he he was doing what a good', 'scientist will do. He took the data put', 'his confidence in the data. It was later', 'shown that the data he was basing his', 'argument on was false.', 'It could not be verified by the work of', 'other scientists. In fact, no, the', 'spiral nebula had no motion across the', 'sky. And so, Shappley was just wrong.', \"Later, we would later show that he's\", 'wrong. And', 'what puts the nail in the coffin?', '1923,', 'Edwin Hubble. Oh, the man. Hubble was a', 'person before he was a telescope. Yeah.', 'I thought I thought he he was born a', 'telescope. Born a telescope.', \"Yeah. Just like when you're a kid,\", 'you\\'re like, \"Of course you there was', 'Ninja Turtles and they were birthed and', 'Yeah, there it is. There it is. So, you', 'had an idea based on evidence and it', 'turned out to be wrong because the', \"evidence was flawed. So, this there's\", 'some lessons there. All right. And if', 'one scientist has one bit of evidence,', \"you don't alert the authorities yet\", \"until there's confirming other\", 'experiments to do so. That is uh what', \"the peer review is all about. That's the\", 'peer review is all about. And by the', 'way, for anybody who wants to know, uh', 'scientists are haters. Okay? That is', 'what they do. You come up with something', 'and somebody goes, I call And', \"then it's on. Then it's just on. Wait,\", 'wait. So Neil, so Neil, a peer review to', 'to us non-scientists is is basically', \"it's scientific group chat where you\", 'present your takeer information and the', '17 other friends that are in the group', 'chat get to be like like', 'and Sapply had a had a green bubble in', \"in the chat. That's Oh godamn.\", 'God damn. What a horrible what a', 'horrible life to live. He was the one', 'green. He was the one green surrounded', 'by blues.', \"Yeah. And if you have an idea and it's\", \"and it's shown to be wrong, Yeah. then\", \"it's just wrong. In fact, Einstein after\", \"his relativity, which we'll get into in\", 'a couple of minutes, uh that was hard to', 'accept by people, right? There was, you', 'know, it was it was hard. It was very', 'counterintuitive.', 'Someone came up with a work saying 100', 'against Einstein.', \"100 against Einstein. And then he's\", 'rumored to say what after that? See, I I', \"I just learned this anecdote, but he's\", 'rumored to have said, \"Why 100?\" If I\\'m', 'wrong, one would have been enough.', \"Wow. Yeah. It's pretty great. Yeah. And\", \"believe me, I I've been married for 27\", 'years. That is right.', 'Good enough.', \"Okay. So, here's what happened. So Edwin\", 'Hubble is curious about these spiral', 'nebula and he finds a star in them that', \"matches a kind of star that's not in a\", \"nebula that's just sort of nearer by\", \"than that star and it's it's a very\", 'specific kind of variable star uh named', 'after the very first of its kind sephiid', 'variable uh the first of its kind was', 'found in the constellation Sephiius and', \"so that's how we categorize types of\", 'variable stars. The first one in a', 'constellation. All the others, no matter', 'where you find them, are that variety.', 'Found a sephiid variable there. And what', \"was tell us what's special about the\", 'sephiid variables. Well, they have a', 'very predictable property where their', 'luminosity, how bright they shine, is', 'related to a sort of oscillation. And', \"you so you can tell uh that you're\", \"looking at precisely one of those. It's\", \"it's very easily identifiable if you get\", 'the luminosity out of it. Yeah. Then you', 'can say I can see the the period vary,', 'right? Based on that period, I know how', 'bright it should be. How bright it', \"should be. So it's as though you knew\", 'your light bulb, right? You can tell if', 'you have a very bright light bulb far', 'away or a very dim light bulb up close,', 'right? But how can you distinguish the', 'two? And how do you distinguish the two', 'if you know nothing about the light', 'bulb? But if you know everything about', 'your light bulb, yes, you know exactly', 'what it is. Then you can say, \"Oh, I', 'know this light bulb, so I know exactly', 'how far away it So he says this star is', 'of this particular luminosity and the', 'only way it can be that dim Mhm. is if', 'it is far out far away. You know', 'everything happens in space and space is', 'happening in spaceime. In the four', 'dimensions of spacetime there can never', 'be a time without a place and vice', 'versa. If I say meet me, you will need', 'to know where and what time to make that', 'happen regardless of the place', 'throughout the entire universe. Well,', 'how would you like to give the gift of', 'spacetime? Suppose I told you you could', 'mark any occasion with a beautiful', 'physical representation of its', 'corresponding spacetime. Well, thanks to', 'our friends at Underlucky Stars, you can', 'do just that. Underlucky Stars makes', 'beautifully designed star maps that show', 'the unique alignment of the stars in a', 'place and date chosen by you.

That's underluckystars.com.\", 'And now back to the spaceime that is the', \"show. But it's important to know what he\", 'actually meant by that because Hubble', 'himself never was convinced that these', 'were actually other galaxies. He proved', 'that there was something beyond the', 'outskirts of our galaxy. We knew our', 'galaxy about 100,000 lighty years', 'across. He his analysis showed this to', 'be 900,000 lighty years. We now update', 'it to 2 million lighty years. But Hubble', 'was so conservative that he was', 'unwilling to then say this is an island', 'universe. This is a galaxy in its own', 'right. What an idiot.', \"Wait, what's the difference just from a\", \"space real estate standpoint? What's the\", 'difference between an island universe', 'and a galaxy? What are we talking?', \"They're poetically identical. They're\", \"the same. They're the same. Poetically\", 'identical. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.', 'Because if our galaxy is our', \"universe and there's another galaxy,\", 'then you get to call that a universe.', 'Except once we see the full breadth of', 'it all, we got to reallocate how we use', 'the word universe.', \"Cuz it's universe,\", 'one', \"in one verse, right? But we're in we're\", \"in the we're in the the multiverse\", \"Spider-Man. We're in the We'll get to\", \"that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get\", 'to that. All right. Minus the', \"Spider-Man, but we'll we'll we'll we'll\", \"You didn't like the second one.\", 'I thought it was great. So So Jana, how', \"did we're reeling from the fact that we\", \"are not the universe. We're just a part\", 'of a universe. And then a few years', 'later, Hubble', 'discovers that these spiral nebula', \"are in motion, body and soul. So what's\", \"going on there? Yeah. So once he's\", 'starting to be able to use these sephiid', 'variables and these standard candles to', 'get a strong sense of how far away', 'things are, he can start do that. He can', 'start to do that kind of mapping out the', 'local environment, what what we have', 'right nearby and then also galaxies', 'further away, these little smudges on', 'the sky. And he begins to catalog not', 'only that there are other galaxies', 'around us at great distances but there', 'also seem to be receding away from us', 'largely predominantly. Yeah. And so he', 'makes a plot of makes a plot. So this is', \"very strange. I mean you're looking at\", 'all of these enormous galaxies. So, a', 'galaxy is a collection of hundreds of', \"billions of stars and they're pretty\", \"localized and maybe they're spirals and\", \"uh blobs and they're very far away and\", \"they're also moving away from us in\", 'every direction which is very peculiar.', \"So, he makes this plat. It's completely\", 'freaky but it gets freakier because the', \"further away they are the faster they're\", \"expanding away from us and they're\", 'calculating this all without computers.', 'Well, hundreds of billions people were', 'called computers back then.', 'Sure. Yeah. If you look at old', 'dictionaries, look at the word computer.', 'A person who makes the person who', \"computes. Yes. So, wait. Uh, and there's\", \"a room full of Yes. But they're doing it\", 'without the machines. The a room full of', 'computers at Harvard at the time. Yes.', 'So, he actually uses the work of one of', 'the Harvard computers, which was a woman', 'named Henrietta Levit. And um she was', 'part of a group of women who worked at', 'the Harvard Observatory that were called', 'up like this.', \"Well, they were called Pickering's Harum\", 'because Charles Pickering at one point', 'was so frustrated with his male', 'computers that he fired them all and he', 'said, \"My maid could do a better job.\"', 'And he hired his maid who was Willamina', 'Fleming and she did a great job.', 'Um, and she hired all these other women', 'and one of whom was Henrietta Levit and', 'she made 30 cents an hour.', 'Go ahead.', 'Are we applauding her or her pay?', \"That was weird. 30 cents an hour. That's\", 'She should be making iPhones.', 'Okay, so', 'I said it. I said it.', \"All right, so but mixed in here, we've\", 'got simultaneous things going on.', \"Einstein's general theory of relativity\", 'is already at the races. Okay, so that', 'came in in 1915. 15. Okay, that gave us', 'a mechanism to understand what the whole', 'universe could be doing. Just catch us', 'up on that. Well, Einstein writes down', 'his equations in 1915 and initially he', 'applies them to things like the motion', 'of the earth around the sun and', 'terrestrial and nearby motion, local', 'things. But then some other very', 'creative thinkers, one in particular was', 'a Belgian priest named George Lamemetra.', 'He', 'decides to apply the mathematics not to', 'something in the universe but to the', 'entirety of the universe and find from', 'the equations that the universe should', 'be expanding over time. It should be', 'just to be clear, he was able to do that', 'not based on his training as a priest.', 'He was a priest physicist.', 'He was a priest physicist. But no doubt', 'his interest in applying these ideas to', 'the entirety of the universe was not', 'distinct from his focus on the big', \"questions of existence. So they weren't\", 'that separate. Although he in his own', 'mind was very clear. He said there are', 'two ways to have deep insight about the', \"world. There's mathematics and there's\", 'salvation. And he said, \"Let me follow', 'both.\" And that\\'s what he did. But not', 'intermingled. He was very clear not to.', 'There was a line in the sand.', 'Absolutely. Yeah. Wait. So what? So So', 'matra,', \"I'll let I'll let you guys figure out\", 'the pronunciation. So he takes the', 'equations. We We have an expanding', 'universe, but he So Lamatra before', 'before Lumatra predicts an expanding', \"universe using Einstein's equations.\", 'Yes. So Einstein could have made the', \"prediction and he didn't. Yeah. In fact,\", 'in 1917, Einstein actually got there', 'first and when he applied the equations', 'to the entirety of space was very', \"disturbed that he couldn't get a\", 'universe that met his own philosophical', 'prejudice which was that the universe is', 'fixed, eternal, static and unchanging.', 'Why would anybody think the universe', 'could be anything other than that? Well,', 'I mean there is this book called Genesis', 'which seems to suggest a beginning.', 'Okay. So, there are some people who', 'think perhaps that that vision is not', 'correct. But Einstein and many others at', 'the time very firmly believed that the', 'universe could not change on the largest', \"of scales. And that's just a\", 'philosophical bias. Totally. And in', 'fact, heat changes. Wait, wait, wait,', 'wait. How could he how could he get away', 'with that? If all the galaxies have', 'gravity and if they all feel each', \"other's gravity, they would all collapse\", 'down into one point. Yeah. So this was', 'an argument that Isaac Newton actually', 'gave hundreds of years earlier. But if', 'the universe is infinitely big and if', 'the galaxies are spread across an', 'infinity of space then there is no', 'center for them to collapse toward. So', 'you can envision a static universe. Now,', \"if it's infinite, if it's infinite, if\", 'and only. But even more than that,', 'Einstein then in his own general', 'relativity recognized basically the', \"issue that you're raising in a finite\", 'universe. And he said, \"Let me introduce', 'a repulsive push to counter the', 'attractive pull of gravity.\" And', 'anti-gravity, an anti-gravity force', 'field called the cosmological constant.', 'So he introduces this into the math in', '1917. It was not in the 1915 equations.', 'He introduces it just to have a static', 'universe that will allow him to breathe', 'easy and to fulfill his philosophical', 'bias. Then the mantra says we can have', 'an expanding universe. And so how did', 'Einstein react to that? Einstein learns', 'of this from lametra in 1927', 'and he says to lamera your calculations', 'are correct but your physics is', 'abominable.', 'Oh them fighting words. They were', 'fighting words. Wait, by which he was', \"saying you can't trust that every\", 'mathematical calculation tells you', 'something real about reality. Some math', \"should be in math textbooks and it's\", \"interesting but it's nothing more than a\", 'mathematical curiosity. And he says,', 'Lmetra, your idea of an expanding', \"universe, that's a mathematical\", \"curiosity. It's not real. Okay. So then\", '1929, Hubble discovers an expanding', 'universe. Now what? What happens next?', \"Well, so it's interesting because the\", 'way I originally described it is kind of', 'confusing. You might think it makes it', \"seem like we're at the center of this\", \"expansion and everything's receding away\", 'from us. But the way the Hubble law is', \"specifically, it's much more like the\", 'space between every galaxy is actually', 'stretching. So from their point of view,', 'if you were on one of those other', 'galaxies, it would also look like', 'everything,', \"right? Everything's receding away from.\", \"And if you imagine that it's not the\", 'galaxies literally moving on spacetime,', 'but actually the distance between the', \"galaxies that's stretching, then\", 'something further away is actually', \"moving away from you faster. There's\", 'more space stretching. And this was', \"really closer to Latra's description.\", \"Not even closer. It simply wasn't\", \"static. So, so just so I'm clear, at\", \"that time they believe there's only one\", 'galaxy in approximately 1925. Just so', \"I'm following I feel like I'm in a Chris\", \"Nolan right now. I'm watching Tenant.\", \"Let me just let's pause real quick. No,\", 'no. Up until 23, 24, one galaxy. One', \"galaxy. It wasn't. It was one universe.\", 'One universe. Copy. Yes. Here we are', '2025 from what I understand. Yes. Now', \"there's How many How many universes are\", 'we in now? But are you talking island', 'universes or are you talking universe?', \"Universe. I'm talking about the whole\", \"Oh, good God. There's one universe that\", 'we know about filled with 100 billion', 'galaxies, each of which has on the order', 'of 100 billion stars. There are', 'theoretical ideas that Neil is', 'suggesting we might get to tomorrow uh', 'that that speak to the possibility there', 'might be other universes. So the answer', \"is we don't know for sure, but the data\", \"seems to suggest that there's one\", 'universe. Well, we we were talking about', 'this backstage. If the del the delta is', 'that big between those two numbers which', 'is one and you just basically said a', 'gajillion,', 'how do we know how do we know that the', \"what we're living in right now, the data\", \"that we know right now isn't going to be\", 'wildly off and 50 years from now or 100', \"years from now they'll be like look at\", 'those dumb dums in 2025. We hope we hope', \"that that's what will happen. That's\", 'what we live for. We live to be stupid.', \"We live to be wrong. We're scientists.\", 'Oh, got it.', \"So, we lived in Iran. We're scientists.\", \"Got it. Okay. Well, so let's let's\", 'follow through this reasoning. We', \"discover an expanding universe. If we're\", \"expanding, that means we're bigger today\", 'than we were yesterday and bigger', 'yesterday than we were the day before.', 'So,', 'logically, where does that take us?', 'Bigger. No, no. going back in time. What', \"is that? Oh, I'm sorry. So, yeah. So, if\", \"you're already disturbed about the lack\", 'of permanence to the universe, then this', 'very quickly leads you to have even', 'greater existential dread because if you', 'run the movie backwards, then everything', 'was once closer together. And if you', 'keep running the movie backwards, it', 'gets to a point which seems quite', 'catastrophic where these galaxies are', 'literally on top of each other. And', \"eventually you're kind of imagining\", \"something that's so dense that you have\", 'to start thinking of it as hot and uh', 'soupy and and and chaotic and', 'then what what did Lamontra call this?', 'Yeah. So Latra basically said look if', 'the math is saying that the universe is', \"expanding today and if then Hubble's\", 'data shows that the universe is', 'expanding today just wind the cosmic', 'film in reverse. You run the film', 'backwards and things get closer and', 'closer together and there suggests that', \"there's a point in the distant past when\", 'everything was on top of everything else', 'and he calls this the primeval atom.', 'This is the beginning according to his', 'description. Okay. I happen to know', 'there was an astronomer active at the', 'time, brilliant guy named Fred Hy who', 'was not into a universe that would be', 'changing. Yeah. He knew the universe was', \"expanding. He couldn't reason that away.\", 'He accepted that. Yeah. accepted that.', \"But if you're expanding, but you're\", 'always the same, that must mean matter', 'is being spontaneously created in the', 'void to create new galaxies. So that', 'statistically the universe always looks', \"the same. Yeah. You know, but here's the\", 'thing. If the universe is expanding,', 'that in itself is a change. So why would', 'you not accept a changing universe? Cuz', 'he wanted to always look the same for', 'all of time, for all eternity, in the', \"past and in the future. Again, it's a\", 'philosophical bias, but I think the idea', 'of a beginning was particularly', 'disturbing. Wow. The idea. So, so this', 'primeval atom, the literatur scientists,', 'but not for religious people where God', \"made the universe. They're perfectly\", 'happy with the beginning. Look, Pope', 'Pius I 12th, perhaps the nerdiest pope', 'in history who love science. Wait, wait,', \"why do you know this? He I don't know.\", \"He took he took Lmetra's work and he\", 'said, \"There is the scientific evidence', 'for Genesis.\" That\\'s what he said. And', 'and when Lmetra heard this, he threw a', 'fit. Belgian priest Lmetra, the pope is', 'talking to him d not directly, but yes,', 'when he catches wind that this is what', 'the pope is saying. And one of his', 'students who was in the class that', 'Lmetra had to teach that afternoon after', 'learning said that Lamemetra who', 'normally was very quiet and', 'mildmannered. He came in and ranted for', '45 minutes because his whole point was I', 'am not blending my religious life and my', 'scientific life. And here the pope is', \"taking my scientific work and he's\", 'turning into religion. But notice he', 'said all that to a student and not the', 'pope.', \"You don't want to know the Galileo\", 'situation. Exactly. Yeah. So, I have a a', 'tamer version of that quote. It\\'s, \"As', 'far as I see, such a theory of the', 'primeval atom remains entirely outside', 'any metaphysical or religious question.\"', \"Yeah. That's after I had a couple drinks\", 'and chill.', 'Okay. So, so then it got called the Big', 'Bang by by Fred Hoy. By Fred Hy. Yeah.', 'So Fred Hoy was in a 1948 BBC radio', 'interview. Why do you know this level of', 'detail about Okay. And so he is', 'describing his own approach which as you', 'mentioned is a steadystate approach', 'where matter is created spontaneously', 'and fills in the gaps in space. And so', 'they ask him about this other approach', 'not his. And he says oh that theory in', 'which all matter must be created in one', \"big bang. And that's where the idea of\", 'big bang theory comes from. Now people', 'have interpreted that as a derogatory', 'description. His own way of recounting', 'the story is he was simply trying to', 'draw a distinction between a theory in', 'which in his steady state only a little', 'bit of matter is created here in the air', 'cross space versus this other theory', 'like one hydrogen atom per century per', \"cubic lightyear. I mean there's some\", 'small rate not not quite that small. So', \"it's it is one atom per century per\", 'Olympic size swimming pool. Oh, okay. I', 'thought it was bigger than that. And', \"that's all that you need. And so it's\", 'kind of an in the whole universe. Yeah.', \"Yeah. Yeah. Because what's more\", 'believable that one little atom forms in', 'a cubic, you know, in a swimming pool', 'size arena of space per century or that', \"there's this moment where everything is\", 'created all at once. Framing it that', 'way, his theory sounds perhaps a little', 'bit more believable, less less crazy.', 'Yeah. Yeah. So what do we have to assume', 'if there is a big bang? So we got to', 'assume that the expansion has been', \"uniform the whole time. Not it doesn't\", 'have to be uniform. Yeah. It can change', \"over time. Well, that's been always\", \"expanding. It's always expanding. Okay.\", \"And unless there's extra dimensions,\", 'those might All right. Well, so it could', 'expand differently enough. Brian and I', 'are talking about this later. Well,', 'yeah, you can squeeze the other', 'dimensions there. There could have been', 'chaotic mixing of the expansion and', 'contraction but overall the overall', 'volume of the universe was expanding.', 'But the way you get this is looking at', 'the rate at which the universe is', 'expanding. Yes. And that is a slope on a', 'graph. And Hubble first derived that and', \"it's there's a slope. He called it the\", 'letter C which is for constant. But', 'since then we swapped that out with a', 'capital H for Hubble and we call it the', 'Hubble constant. very famous Hubble', \"constant. So it's constant over space. I\", \"mean it's important over time. It's\", 'really the Hubble parameter we should', 'call it because it does change in time.', 'It was it could have been faster in the', 'early universe, faster in the future.', 'All right. So Hubble I he had the wrong', 'turned out uh the sephiid variable he', 'used', \"he didn't know at the time there were\", 'two varieties of sephiid variables. The', \"one that's near us and the one that you\", 'can see from far far away. and he', 'presumed they were the same. No reason', 'to think otherwise. So he got the wrong', 'distance, the wrong expansion rate of', 'the universe. So Sephias is like', 'diabetes is type one and type two. Yes,', \"there's a type one and type two.\", 'Exactly. I think', '[Music]', 'maybe not exactly.', \"Yes, there's literally type one sephiid\", 'and type two sephiate. And you got to', \"use apples and apples when you're doing\", 'this exercise. So, so he got an age of', 'the universe of two billion years. We', 'would later refine these numbers. Uh,', 'when I was in graduate school many moons', 'ago, the uncertainty in the Hubble', 'constant was a factor of two. It there', 'was a 10. So, with the with the Hubble', 'constant, you run the film backwards.', 'Ask how much time at this expansion rate', 'looking backwards, when do we get to', 'time zero? Mhm. That makes sense. Well,', 'yeah. Just just when is everybody in the', \"same place at the same time? That's a\", 'perfectly sensible question. And we got', 'two number. There are two camps. Okay. A', '10 billionyear camp and a 20 billion', 'year camp. A fac a whole factor of two.', 'And everyone is, you know, fighting for', \"their and we know they both can't be\", 'right. And so we need better data. One', \"of the goals of Wait, isn't isn't being\", \"off by 10 billion quite a bit? That's a\", 'lot. But I again comedian and I only', 'took physics one in undergrad. I did not', \"advance not I don't want the smoke but I\", 'am saying being off by 10 billion is a', \"lot. Here's the thing like if you go out\", \"to dinner and we split it and I'm off\", \"by that like that big of a delta. If I'm\", \"if I'm Yeah. If I'm 100% off. Yes. Yes.\", \"Aren't you like you lose your science\", 'little thing? No. So you know what I', 'mean? like could have been disbarred.', \"Yeah. Here's the thing. But you know,\", \"you just get to talk your Here's\", 'the thing. You are off by 10 billion.', \"You get to talk your still. Here's\", 'the thing. Like my dad in the', \"living room when he's giving his\", 'opinions about politics. He just gets to', 'run his mouth continuously.', 'I got this. Go ahead. No, this is me and', 'my This is a me and my dad thing, but', \"I'm just a little mad that that that a\", 'capital S scientist was this off. Okay.', 'Go ahead. Uh and I have a second', 'question, but go ahead. The universe is', 'vast. Yes. In time. Yeah. And in space.', \"It is vast in every metric we've ever\", 'established for it. There are things', 'that are vast in size,', 'in temperature, in speed, in gravity.', \"And so if I'm off by a factor of two,\", 'between 10 billion and 20 billion, yeah,', 'I could have been off by a factor of 10,', 'by a factor of a thousand, by a factor', 'of a million. We were quite happy. We', 'were in the same sandbox having that', \"conversation. So it's kind it's kind of\", \"like being Jeff Bezos, you know, if I'm\", 'off by 10 billion, eh, not so bad.', 'So, so can I also ask you the second', 'philosophical question which is which is', 'no no this is this is for real when when', \"you were like it's either 10 billion or\", '20 billion and I was asking you this', 'backstage which was if when the number', 'is that big is it almost like the United', \"States's debt where they're like the the\", \"deficit is at 28 trillion and you're\", \"like what does it even matter now it's\", 'at a gajillion manilion like what does', 'it matter why does the Cuz I feel like a', \"freshman When I'm done, it's going to\", 'matter an awful lot.', '[Laughter]', 'I would I would say that actually 10', 'billion is actually quite good. 10 to 20', 'is very much in the ballpark because you', 'should run the Federal Reserve.', 'You should Yeah. Yeah. This stage, you', 'know, who knows who has a good way to', 'think about it. You could have been off', 'by a trillion. Well, but the future is', 'going to be much much longer than the', \"past. So, it's not as though the\", 'universe kind of will expire within', \"another 10 billion years like we're\", 'confined to this number. The future', 'could be just a huge number. We could be', \"living in a time where it's not 10\", 'billion. But can I give you perhaps one', 'these are all very very good answers but', 'perhaps one other way of looking at it.', \"You're saying it was a bad question. Bad\", 'question. These are great answers. Bad', \"question. We don't care whether it's 10\", 'billion or 20 billion. The number', \"doesn't matter. What does matter is\", \"That's the most American answer by the\", \"way. That's the most American answer.\", \"Yeah, the truth is we don't care. But we\", 'want our theories to work. We want our', 'theories to make predictions that match', \"with observations. That's the only thing\", 'that matters to us. The actual answer', \"that comes out, whether it's 10 billion\", \"or 50 billion or 42 like you're saying,\", \"it just doesn't matter. But we need to\", 'have a consistent description so that we', \"have evidence that we know what we're\", 'doing because evidence matters. And both', 'sides could not be right. Right. And so', 'when the Hubble telescope was launched,', \"okay, I'm just getting out of graduate\", 'school, it is launched. The number one', 'goal set for that telescope was to', 'resolve that discrepancy. The', \"telescope's named after the guy who gave\", 'us the Hubble constant in the first', 'place. Within two or three years, we', 'nailed it. And the Hubble constant, its', 'value would give us an age of the', 'universe at about 14 billion years,', 'which is comfortably between those two', \"extremes. And that's science working at\", \"its best. It was there's a limit to how\", 'much we can keep beating each other over', 'the head. Let', \"let's get more data. Let's build a\", \"telescope that'll solve this. And in\", 'fact, today there is a similar argument', \"happening. It's not between 20 billion\", 'and 10 billion, which as you say is a', 'factor of two or 100% difference. Now', \"we're down to the 5% difference. We\", 'understand things that well that we have', 'two groups that are 5% apart describing', 'a number of years billions of years into', \"the past and that's the precision with\", 'which we can do it within 5%.', 'People will kill each other.', \"So again, we don't care the exact\", 'number. We care that we can describe it', \"with that level of precision when we're\", 'talking about events that happened', \"billions of years ago. That's the\", \"mindbending. And and here's the issue.\", 'When it was 10 and 20 billion, you', 'always have to report your uncertainties', 'for a number in science. And those', 'uncertainties had a little bit of', 'overlap in the middle. And it landed', 'where you expected it to land. Now that', 'we have two other waring factions on the', 'value of the Hubble constant, those two', 'numbers are within 5% of each other, but', 'the uncertainties are tight. Yeah. So', \"the uncertainties don't overlap. And if\", 'you look at go Google search on Hubble', \"tension and that's what will come up.\", 'Adam Ree is coming to Pioneer Works in', 'October. I just planted an ad coming to', \"Adam Ree who's a Nobel Prize one of the\", 'Nobel Prize winners who discovered that', 'the universe is not just expanding. The', \"expansion is getting over faster. It's\", 'accelerating. Who is part of this Hubble', 'tension debate uh will be speaking at', 'Pioneerics on the H without without', 'waxing without waxing philosophical. I', \"just don't want to miss this point that\", \"we're not actually saying which is what\", 'makes science so incredibly great is', 'exactly what you all just uh', 'demonstrated. It is this pursuit of the', 'truth based upon the best available', \"information at the time. So it's okay if\", \"it's wrong because when it's right,\", \"we're going to get there. Yes,\", 'you got it.', 'All right. So,', \"we're turning the clock back and\", 'we get to the big bang and but now the', 'universe large scale universe described', 'by general relativity is now small.', 'It is so small you extend the equations', 'go back. The universe is the size of an', 'atom. Does quantum physics apply to the', 'entire universe or only to atoms. What', 'where does that where where are you on', 'that both of you? Well, at this point we', 'feel we have to invoke quantum mechanics', 'to understand what was happening in the', 'big bang at the energy scales are so', \"dramatic and um that we're really\", 'probing quantum physics. high energies,', \"you're really looking somewhat\", 'surprisingly at small scales. Um, so we', 'we are still trying to grapple with what', 'the big bang is telling us about uh the', 'potential to understand not just general', 'relativity but a kind of quantum variant', 'of that if there is such a thing. Yeah.', 'So I got general relativity, I got', 'quantum physics. Do they make nice in', \"the sandbox? That's it's a deep and\", 'difficult question and one that I and', 'many others have spent their lives', 'trying to answer and we do not fully', 'have the answer yet. Let me restate', 'that. Yeah. That you and others have', 'spent your lives failing to answer. Yes.', 'Okay. I agree. But I think this guy', 'you hear that ah take that. Okay. You', 'got a fan over here. All right. Go. No,', \"it's exactly the case. So when you take\", \"Einstein's equations of the general\", 'theory of relativity and you try to', 'invoke quantum mechanics within the same', 'calculations which as you eloquently', \"noted you'd have to do if you're talking\", \"about the whole universe when it's\", \"incredibly small. You need Einstein's\", \"general theory of relativity. It's the\", 'whole universe after all. But you also', 'need quantum physics because it is so', \"small and that's the theory that\", 'describes the small things. And when you', 'try to simply put the equations', 'together, you get one answer out from', 'almost any calculation, which is', 'infinity. And that might sound, oh,', \"that's interesting, a big, deep,\", \"mystical number. No, it's nonsense.\", \"Infinity is nature's way of grabbing us\", 'by the lapel and slapping us around and', 'saying, \"You\\'re doing something wrong.', 'You\\'ve got to figure this out.\" So, I\\'ve', \"heard another one.

So 1923,', 'the wave particle duality is proposed.', \"Yeah. So that's kind of freaky. Mhm.\", 'that particles are also waves. Yeah. It', 'was Prince Louisie De Bruy who basically', 'he was a prince.

And then in\", '1923 in his PhD thesis Louis de Bruy', 'says let me do the reverse. Electrons we', 'always think about them as particles.', 'Maybe they need to be thought of as', 'waves. Wow. And that is a key moment in', 'his That was a prince who did that. A', \"prince. Prince. I don't believe it.\", 'I I I know current monarchy.

No, no,', \"that's this I got this America. We\", 'fought a war to get away from monarchs.', 'Um, not for long.', 'Just give it time.', 'Okay.', 'So, so then Schroinger came around.', 'Oh, we have a Schroer fan up. That was', 'the cat. That was the cat.', 'That That was the cat. Cat. So what does', 'Schroinger do for us? Well, Schrodener', 'begins to think more abstractly', \"about what's real and what's not real.\", \"So we're used to thinking of particles.\", \"You've already described Deb Brogley and\", 'the electron. We we think of these', 'little fundamental particles almost like', 'billiard balls acting out their lives', 'and they have some concrete existence.', 'Schroinger starts to say, well, this', \"wave particle duality, that's pretty\", 'profound, but maybe the only thing', \"that's real is this thing called the\", 'wave function, which is the probability', 'for the particle to be in a certain', 'state, to be in a certain location, to', 'be moving with a certain speed. But the', \"particle itself in some sense isn't real\", 'anymore. If you look for it, sometimes', \"you'll find it in a concrete location.\", 'But what is really determined by', 'equations, by the laws of physics, is', 'the wave function, which is this', 'probabilistic description. And the wave', 'function occupies physical space,', \"doesn't it? Yeah, the wave function\", 'occupies physical space for only for a', \"single particle. So it's a kind of\", 'important subtlety. For one particle,', 'you can think about this wave function', 'as filling space. If there are two', 'particles, it lives in sixdimensional', 'space. If there are three particles,', \"it's a nine dimensional space. So you\", \"really can't think of it in these\", 'ordinary terms. Oh, I am high.', 'Okay. So, so if the particle can be', 'anywhere here and I have some barrier', 'here, Mhm. it could show up on the other', 'side of the barrier. Yeah. Right. But it', \"doesn't actually travel through. So\", \"let's say your barrier is a concrete\", \"wall. There's some small probability\", 'that you would find the particle. Well,', 'the wave function would describe the', 'probability of finding the particle in', \"this region of space, but it doesn't\", 'actually like a billiard ball travel', 'through the cement wall. Okay, this', 'might be the THC talking, but the way', 'you guys are talking,', 'there just might just be one particle.', \"Like, there aren't bunch of particle.\", \"It's just one particle. I told you he\", 'blew a gasket. Well, but but but but', 'Richard Feineman had the idea that maybe', 'there was one particle that circled', 'around through time and cycled back over', 'and over again, giving what appear to be', \"many particles now, but there's only a\", 'single particle through this temporal', \"cycle. So, you're right on target,\", 'moving forward and backwards through', 'time. I can Oh my god. Okay. Okay. All', \"right. So, but what I'm saying is if a\", 'particle can show up on the other side', \"of the the barrier, then that's you guys\", \"came up with a word for that and it's\", 'tunneling. Quantum tunneling. It can', 'quantum tunnel through the barrier. But', \"that but that's the the point of\", \"shortinger saying what's real is just\", 'this probabilistic likelihood of finding', 'the particle. The particle itself in', 'some sense does not have concrete', 'existence anymore. It challenges the', 'whole nature of reality. No, but', 'concretely there is a probability that', 'we could calculate Yes. for the', 'likelihood of you tunneling through the', 'stage and being underneath the floor.', \"And it's a nonzero probability. It's\", \"kind of small, so it's unlikely to\", \"happen, but that's what quantum\", 'mechanics tells us. But the smaller I', 'get, the more likely it will happen.', 'Exactly. It can happen in the', 'laboratory. Yeah. Okay. So, just for', 'context here. Wow. That is we were', 'trying to understand how the sun made', 'energy and we did the calculation. Once', 'we determined the sun is mostly hydrogen', \"and it's hottest in the center, we said\", 'it must be undergoing fusion. And what', 'you run the math to undergo fusion, a', 'proton, y the nucleus of a hydrogen atom', 'has to merge with another proton, the', 'nucleus of another hydrogen atom.', 'Protons have the same charge.', 'Electrostatically like charges repel. So', 'they have to be moving fast enough', 'so that before they have a chance to', 'repel, they stick together and form a', 'new nucleus. Okay, we calculated what', 'temperature that was necessary because', 'high temperatures give you higher', 'speeds. We calculated that temperature', 'and it was 100 million degrees and there', 'was no way the center of the sun was', 'going to give us 100 million degrees', 'because you can calculate through', 'sensible laws of thermodynamics what', 'that should be. And we were scratching', 'our heads. And then quantum physics', 'comes around and then you invent this', 'spooky magical thing called tunneling.', 'And we discover in our calculations that', 'at a mere 10 million degrees, see these', 'this matters 10 million, 100 million, at', 'a mere 10 million degrees, they would', 'otherwise not hit, but some of them', 'tunnel through and connect. Tunneling', \"makes the sun's energy production even\", 'possible. Yeah. And I was like,', \"because it's not just some some thing\", 'that particle physicists worry about in', 'their laboratory. I had to worry about', 'it as an astrophysicist. Why Why are you', \"worried about this? It's okay. Okay. I\", \"The sun's going to sun, you know.\", 'Robbins, let them let the sun let the', \"sun do that. Thank you. It's okay. Okay.\", \"Thank you, Neil. Don't Don't blow that.\", \"That's very very okay. So tunneling more\", \"there's a lot tunneling and Yeah. So now\", 'what about the Heisenberg uncertainty', \"principle? That's that seems like the\", 'biggest thing of them all. Talk me', 'through that real fast. Yeah, I would', \"say so that's the real moment when the\", 'old ways of looking at the world are', 'shown they have to be jettisoned because', 'the old way of looking at the world,', \"what is reality? Reality is stuff that's\", 'at a location moving with a certain', \"speed. That's the way we describe the\", 'world. And Heisenberg with the armature', \"of quantum mechanics says you can't\", \"actually do that. You can't specify the\", 'location and the speed simultaneously of', \"any object. You can't do it according to\", 'the quantum equation. So the very', 'language of reality that we used to use', 'no longer applies. No longer applies.', \"Why can't you measure both at the same\", 'time? Well, if you have a particle', 'described as a wave, right, and you want', 'that particle to have a definite', 'location, that wave has to be highly', 'spiked. So that you can say, ah, almost', \"100% likelihood it's at this location.\", 'But when you see how the notion of', 'velocity comes into quantum mechanics,', 'it has to do with the wavelength of the', 'wave. And so if you want something to', 'have a definite speed, it has to have a', \"definite wavelength. That's not spiky.\", 'So to have definite location, you need', 'spike. To have definite speed, you need', 'wave. Those are different shapes. And', \"you can't have them at the same time.\", \"Can't have them at the same time. Can I\", 'try analogy? Nowhere near as precise as', 'what Brian just said, but sometimes I', 'like this musical analogy. If you play a', 'chord, which is a whole bunch of notes', 'together, you can play chords, but you', \"can't simultaneously be playing a single\", 'note. So the chord is like a', 'superposition of the notes. And how this', \"relates is that when you're in a precise\", \"location, what Brian's describing as a\", \"sharp spike, you're sort of in a superp\", 'position of velocities or momenta. So', \"it's like it's like the the location is\", 'the note, the the velocities are the', 'chords. Or vice versa, if I know the', \"velocity exactly and I'm playing chords,\", \"I'm no longer playing individual. I'm\", \"I'm playing I can't isolate a single\", \"individual note. I'm in a superp\", 'position of notes. So what is so how', 'does all this connect to the what they', 'call the observer effect where you I', 'want to measure the particle right there', 'I I got to look at it so I shine light', 'on it and the light sends it somewhere', \"else so I can't actually ever know what\", 'the particle is doing right and and so', \"there's two things in there one is as\", \"you're saying to look is to interact and\", 'when you interact say by bouncing a', 'photon off a particle you affect the', 'particle because I need the photon to', \"take the picture that that's right so\", \"that's one key point that emerges from\", 'these ideas. But the other point that we', 'can never know anything', \"on that on that. That's the crazy thing.\", \"Y'all went on this crazy I'm sorry. I'm\", 'sorry. I got that. That is just not', 'right. Okay. Quantum mechanics tells us', 'that the things that you thought you', 'could know are not the things that you', 'can know. But with quantum mechanics,', \"we've made predictions of the anomalous\", 'magnetic moment of the electron to 14', 'decimal places using a theoretical', \"calculation. And we've measured it and\", 'it agrees decimal by decimal by decimal', \"on all of those numbers. And that's why\", 'we love these numbers. They show us that', \"we understand what we're doing.\", '[Applause]', 'Okay, Brian just blew a gasket. So you', \"can know without knowing is what you're\", 'saying. We can know. Let me just say', \"this, Brian. The type of energy you're\", 'bringing.', 'All right. Wait, wait. Oh, man. You are', 'built for CNN. This type of panel smoke.', 'Oh, fantastic. Yeah. All right. So, this', 'is so be one of those Street Fighter', 'squares. The decimal to the decimal to', \"the Yeah. Oh, it's great. This is great.\", 'This is good stuff. This is good', 'television.', 'So, so go ahead Neil. So, this this', 'observe effect bring us home with', 'certain has been widely', 'mis applied by people thinking my', 'consciousness is affecting the', 'measurement. Look, there is a big', 'mystery at the heart of quantum', 'mechanics. Even with our capacity to', 'make calculations that agree with', 'observations to the level of precision', 'that I just emphasized, perhaps with', 'unnecessary theatricality, there is', \"there is a question that we don't know\", \"how to answer, which is what you're\", 'asking. When you observe, you seem to be', 'able to coax one result, one answer.', 'Even though the quantum description', \"embodies many possibilities, we don't\", 'understand how that happens. Is this the', \"many worlds hypothesis? It's it's one\", 'answer. But the shinger equation is so', 'beautiful and it does not actually', 'include in it uh a way to understand how', \"measurements are made. Yes, that's the\", 'key point. And and so if you really take', 'the shortage of equation very seriously,', 'it simply says there are all of these', \"possibilities and they're all because we\", \"don't have a theory of measurement to\", 'get us through where we are in this in', 'the physics. Just you know there are', 'proposals people have put down', 'mathematical equations that do answer', 'this question. What is the many worlds', 'hypothesis? The many worlds hypothesis', 'is if you have a description of a', 'quantum system like a particle and the', 'quantum wave says 30% chance here, 20%', 'chance here, 50% chance over here, when', \"you measure it, you don't get only one\", \"result. There's one of you that finds it\", \"over here. There's another one of you\", \"that finds it over here. And there's a\", 'third one of you that finds it over', 'here. But these are all in different', \"universes. Oh, it's Rick and Morty.\", 'So you just invented multiple universes', \"to explain something you can't otherwise\", 'explain. The math invented it. Thank', \"you, Chuck. Wait, wait, wait. That's\", 'really important. So this guy named Hugh', 'Everett in 1957 in Princeton. He studies', 'the math, the very equation that Janna', 'made reference to, the Schroinger', 'equation. He says to himself, let me', 'take the math completely seriously and', 'see where it takes me. And the math', 'takes you when you look at the paper,', \"it's direct to this possibility of there\", \"being multiple universe. It's not made\", 'up. It really emerges directly from an', 'analysis of the equations and the', 'equations make predictions that are', 'confirmed. So you say maybe I should', 'take this math fully seriously and', \"that's where it takes you. So the the\", 'passion with which uh Brian is', 'describing this is like me explaining', 'why I have glitter on my face when I', 'come home because I was at an arts and', 'craft fair.', 'Is that right?', \"All right, we're going to have to land\", 'this plane soon. Uh, just briefly, yeah,', 'I know you spent your career doing this,', 'but just in 30 seconds, explain string', 'theory. Oh my god.', '20 seconds. Does life have meaning? Go.', 'I only need 10.

And why do we introduce this', 'idea? When you introduce this idea,', 'quantum mechanics and general relativity', 'do play well in the sandbox.', 'So, wow. Okay. And that was less than 30', 'seconds. Whoa. All right. Okay. So,', \"what's what's in the future? So I know\", \"astrophysically we don't know anything\", \"about dark matter. We don't know\", \"anything about dark energy.

Is what you're\", 'working on or your peeps does it address', 'any of this? Will quantum mechanics take', 'us to all the places we need? Yeah, I', \"mean there's zero evidence that quantum\", 'mechanics has any cracks whatsoever.', \"It's the only theory that we've written\", \"down in the history. It's the most\", 'successful theory. Most successful', 'theory ever. And so we which gives you', 'confidence to believe crazy stuff that', \"it predicts. Exactly.

We're not there yet,\", \"but that's exactly where we're headed.\", 'And why do you need these extra', 'dimensions? Well, Brian was describing', 'string theory, which may or may not be', 'true, but string theory actually', 'requires extra dimensions for it to make', 'sense, for the mathematics to allow', 'gravity and matter and and quantum', 'mechanics to play nice together. But', 'even without string theory, the idea', 'that there are extra spatial dimensions', 'is just kind of a natural extension when', 'you start to think about space and time', 'and you start to take seriously', \"Einstein's ideas. So now we're we're in\", 'the predicament where maybe those extra', 'dimensions are harboring the dark', \"energy. Maybe there's some explanation\", 'for the dark matter having to do with', 'the extra dimensions. So now we can', 'start to think of the extra dimensions', 'as a dark sector um that are harboring', \"really the resolutions like we're\", \"observing them already. We just don't\", 'have the direct connection to be', \"certain. So they're visible in plain\", \"sight. Is that what you're saying? Yeah.\", \"Yeah, I mean they're not literally\", 'visible, but maybe dark energy is a', 'consequence of quantum energies, which', 'is a paper Brian and I wrote many years', 'ago. Dark energy.

Now you got pe you got peeps. Now', 'I got I got really really talented', \"peeps. Okay. All right. That's how that\", 'should work. Uh you are on the LIGO', \"team. Let's test Harrison. Harrison,\", 'what is an acronym? What does LIGO stand', 'for? Uh Lord, I got options.', 'Does that that works', 'Nurgus? I think that should be the new', 'meaning of the of the acronym LIGO. You', \"know, there's a lot of changes coming to\", 'NSF proposals. That could be one of', 'them. Lord, I got options. Uh laser', 'interferometer gravitational wave', 'observatory. Did I get that correct? You', \"did. You did. Very good. And you're on\", 'the team that discovered these. So, I', 'understand they took a bunch of people', 'to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize. Were', 'you on on that plane? Yes. Excellent.', 'You got all dressed up and everything. I', \"kind of Yeah. Yeah. No, that's not my\", 'thing. Kind of. What What What outfit', 'would you have for some other occasion', 'if not for the Nobel Prize? You know,', \"I'm not a dress up type. And so, and and\", \"and then and I'm not a girly type. So, I\", 'had to also decide, am I going to wear', 'like girly clothes or tux? Oh, you fell', 'into a a a habeddashural gap. Yes. A', 'satoral dilemma.', 'Okay.', 'Interesting there. So, what did you end', 'up doing? Just shorts.', \"I feel like that's Sweden was cool with\", 'that, you know.', \"No. So, I'm I'm delighted that you got\", 'to so see that. By the way, we just had', 'on Star Talk. I hung out with Kip', 'Thorne, the man himself, and we visit', 'him in his home and we gave had a whole', 'interview. It was largely about uh, you', 'know, he was one of the executive', 'producers on the film Interstellar. Wow.', 'And it just had its 10th anniversary,', 'and it was a re-release just in', 'celebration of that fact because it had', 'so many people talking about gravity', 'physics and relativity and and all the', 'rest of that. So, anything out there', \"that sort of ratchets up people's\", \"fluency in physics, I'm all for it. Even\", \"if they didn't understand what the hell\", 'they were looking at, right? I was like,', \"Matthew McConna, I think he's aging. I'm\", \"not sure. There's a thing with the\", 'daughter. Yeah, the daughter and the', 'thing. Yeah. So, that we we covered', \"that. But let's get back to\", 'gravitational waves. You reminded me,', \"I'd forgotten that when we were on\", 'stage, we actually did a gravitational', 'wave together. The gravitational wave', \"dance was Yes. Yeah. I I I don't I don't\", 'know if we have footage of that, but I', 'hope not.', \"Me, too. I'm trying to picture it.\", \"So, Nius, remind everybody. We've heard\", 'the term gravitational waves are ripples', \"in spaceime. That's surely accurate, but\", \"I don't know that it helps. So, how can\", \"you dig into that and unpack what's\", 'going on? Yeah. So I think one of the', \"ways we we can think about that is it's\", 'very tempting to look out into space and', 'think of empty space as a number of', \"things that are just aren't true. Space\", \"isn't empty. Space doesn't do nothing.\", 'It actually has many many dynamical', 'properties. Things that like it can', 'curve, it can ripple, it can tear. And', \"so that's really the wavy part of\", 'spaceime. And the idea is is that when', 'we have objects that are massive, so', 'they should have gravity, and if they', \"just When you say massive, you don't\", \"mean a brick or a stone. You're talking\", 'about black holes. Well, you know,', 'bricks and stones would do the same', 'thing, except it would be just a much', 'much smaller effect and harder to', 'measure. A way harder. So, our threshold', 'is for what? I mean our measurement', 'threshold today our measurement', 'thresholds today are not even ordinary', \"stars like our own sun couldn't measure\", \"that. No. So if we're looking for waves\", 'from from these kinds of objects are', 'more things like neutron stars and black', 'holes. So dense objects in the universe', 'where gravity is is saying something.', 'Yeah. So objects where that have so much', 'gravity packed into a small volume that', 'really the space around those objects is', 'very bent. Okay. Have those objects try', 'to empic.', 'Oh. Oh.', 'How did you How do we end up doing doing', 'a commercial for a pharmaceutical', \"company and we're not getting paid for?\", \"We're helping the black holes slim down\", \"a little bit. They're very dense.\", \"They're causing waves and gravity.\", \"That's We don't want them to slim down\", \"for their work. But actually, isn't\", 'Hawking radiation a kind of oympic for', \"black holes? Yeah. They It'll help them\", 'evaporate. Yeah. So, so we got a little', 'mechanism. So, tell everybody about', 'Hawking radiation. So, Hawking radiation', 'it comes about from the quantum', 'mechanical properties of of black holes.', 'So, the idea is that in quantum', 'mechanics we have a phenomenon where', 'particles and antiparticles can uh can', 'be formed out of photons and then they', 'can crash together and become photons', \"again. And Hawking radiation it's energy\", 'to matter matter back to energy. E= MC²', 'would prescribe how much of that is', 'happening right in any moment. Okay.', 'Right. And Hawking on one side M on the', 'other side. So we good. And then C is', 'speed of light. Speed of light squared.', 'Okay. And so this is a a phenomenon by', 'which as you create these particles uh', 'some of that energy can get radiated', 'away. Where does that energy come from?', 'come from? It comes from the properties', 'of the gravitational properties of the', \"black hole. What happens? You're\", 'stealing gravity matter out of the black', 'hole and thereby taking away some of his', 'gravity. Yes. Okay. And and and it just', \"does that. And so so it's a very slow\", 'version of OMIC for black holes. Okay.', \"That's what started this. I want to\", 'finish it there. Right. Okay. Yeah. All', 'right. So, Nurgus, can I take you back', 'to when I was 14? All right. I came to', \"the Hayden Planetarium. Here's my office\", 'here. Uh, I became director of the', 'planetarium. I came here as a not at 14.', 'No, no, no, no.', 'No, ultimately I became director. So,', 'uh, I came here and I beyond the space', 'show that I watched at the time, they', 'would have programs at night, which we', 'still do, and with speakers would come', 'in and give lectures on modern', 'astrophysics. So, I would come in for', 'that and one of them was on black holes.', \"That's when I first learned that gravity\", 'moves at the speed of light. Okay. You', \"knew that when you were 14. I didn't\", \"learn that till I was much older. That's\", \"when I learned it. That's when I learned\", 'it. 15.', 'And then I thought about it and I said,', '\"If gravity travels at the speed of', 'light, then how does gravity get out of', 'a black hole?\"', 'And the answer was a little fishy to', 'me. They said, \"Well, there\\'s a', \"gravitational field that's always there,\", \"and it's a change in the gravitational\", 'field that moves at the speed of light.\"', \"And I don't know if that's accurate, but\", \"that's what the dude told me. And\", \"otherwise he couldn't get gravity out of\", 'a black hole where the black hole', \"doesn't let anything get out even the\", 'speed of light. And that the gravity', \"moves at the speed of light. How's the\", 'gravity going to get out of a black', \"hole? I just don't think of it that way.\", 'I I think about gravity as the geometry', 'of of spaceime and the black hole is', 'part of that geometry and the things', 'that we can know about and this is true', 'for light as well are only things that', 'are outside the horizon of the black', \"hole. So what I've always been taught\", 'and I think I learned this maybe even', \"from Gif Thorne uh was that you it's not\", 'meaningful to think about what happens', \"inside the horizon cuz we don't even\", 'know if our laws of physics would hold', 'there or not. And so when I think about', 'gravity traveling at the speed of light,', \"what's actually traveling at the speed\", 'of light is a gravitational wave. And', \"it's only really meaningful outside of\", 'the horizon. She dodged that one. Yeah,', \"we can't know what's in there, so who\", 'cares? She totally dodged that. No, no,', \"that's good. That's good. That's that's\", 'an important distinction that physics', 'had to mature into as a field to realize', 'there are things that are beyond your', \"knowledge and therefore there's nothing\", 'you can say about it right at all. Uh', 'for now, you know that who knows what', 'which what other forces we might', 'discover that would describe something', 'inside that horizon. Okay. But right now', \"that's not not happening. Okay. So, but\", 'a change in gravity would then be a', 'ripple. A change in that sort of thing', \"that I'm feeling out there. And and we\", 'can just watch that at the speed of', 'light because we say if we pluck the sun', 'from the center of the of our solar', \"system, you wouldn't know about it for 8\", 'minutes and 20 seconds. You would still', \"orbit. We'd still feel the heat. We'd\", 'still feel the gravity. Everything would', 'be normal. And 8 minutes 20 seconds', 'later we fly off at a tangent in the', 'dark and freeze in interstellar space.', 'Have a nice', 'day. How this going to happen? Those', 'eight minutes before are amazing.', \"Did Einstein I don't know that I've seen\", 'the paper that did this. Did he predict', 'gravitational waves? Yeah. So Einstein', 'when he was developing the theory of', 'general relativity and this was the', 'theory of gravity. So the the thing that', \"so we all learn in school Newton's\", \"version of gravity and Newton's law has\", \"been it's easy to understand it's\", 'intuitive. It says you have two objects', \"that have mass and they're going to feel\", 'a force of attraction between them and', 'it was quite quantitative. He said the', 'force of attraction will be proportional', 'to their masses and inversely', 'proportional to the square of the', \"distance separating them. It's very\", \"clean. That's a clean operation. And you\", 'know we teach it in in very early uh', 'sort of first encounters with physics', 'and it was quite successful. It told us', 'about how orbits would work u and and it', 'also had pretty early on places where it', \"didn't work perfectly. Now what Einstein\", 'when he was formulating thinking about', 'gravity he kind of turned it on its head', 'and he said well look gravity is not', 'really a force. Gravity is the geometry', 'of spacetime. Big words. But he had a', 'series of papers, two or three I uh from', '1915 to', '19818 in which he sort of formulated', 'this theory of of general relativity. He', 'wrote down what what are now known as', \"Einstein's equations. They look not that\", \"much worse than say Newton's law except\", \"they're quite beastly. They're very\", 'difficult to solve. But part of that', 'work was that he did ask the question,', \"what happens if whatever object you're\", \"thinking of isn't just sitting still in\", \"space? What happens if it's moving and\", 'not just moving in a const at constant', \"velocity? What happens if it's\", 'accelerating? And then out of his', 'equations popped this wavelike object', 'which he called gravitational waves. at', 'the other. You know, I want stuff like', 'that to pop out of my equation.', 'Do you have equations where stuff pops', 'out? No. Look, me neither.', \"I I'm still stuck on the wave part like\", 'was he gravitational surfing?', 'They have a lot of analogies to that cuz', 'if you wanted to try and visualize what', 'would this look like? One way that you', 'could is you could think of spacetime as', 'the surface of a still pond and you drop', \"a big rock in the middle and there's a\", 'wave that travels a ripple that travels', 'on the surface. It travels outwards from', 'where you drop the rock and if you were', 'a little teeny tiny ant on a surfboard,', 'you would surf that wave, right? And the', 'wavelength, so the distance between the', 'crests, right, would be related to how', 'big was the rock that you dropped in.', 'Exactly. Right. Okay. So when you', 'measure gravitational waves with LIGO or', 'whatever other tools available to you,', 'you try to measure the wavelength of', 'that so that you can infer what created', \"that wave because you don't otherwise\", \"you didn't see the thing happen. No.\", 'Exactly. Right. So we measure a number', 'of things. We measure the wavelength', 'which is the spacing between between the', 'peaks uh in the successive peaks. We', 'also measure the amplitude which is how', 'big what was the height of the wave. And', 'those both of those things are changing', 'with time depending on what the the', 'source is. So by measuring sort of the', 'shape of the wave as you go into it and', 'as you come out of it as as it passes by', 'you as it washes over the earth.', 'Exactly. And as you do that you can tell', 'many you can infer some of the', 'properties of the system that emitted', 'that wave. Sort of like if you just saw', 'the ripple at the edge of the pond and', 'you you have to kind of measure the the', 'frequency of the wave, you have to', 'measure the amplitude of the wave. You', 'have to know something about the density', 'or the viscosity of the water that of', 'the pond and from the medium it would', 'come through differently, right? And and', 'once you have put those things together', 'without ever seeing the rock fall in the', 'center of the pond, you can say', \"something about the rock. And that's\", \"kind of what we're trying to do. So\", \"that's very impressive because you can\", 'you get this measurement and then out in', 'the research papers these are two black', 'holes of 30 m times the mass of the sun', 'colliding a billion light years away. I', \"mean that's badass to make that kind of\", 'statement. It is I think that the', 'properties of the black holes are almost', \"I can't think of too many things that\", 'are more badass than that. I have to', 'tell you why. I mean, so you know, one', 'one of the the first gravitational waves', 'that we measured with LIGO were from', 'these 30 solar mass black holes. And you', 'know what these monsters were doing at', 'the time that they collided? They were', 'moving at half the speed of light. Whoa.', 'Okay. I', \"just You are speechless. I I'm trying to\", \"picture I don't know if I if you I can\", \"actually picture what that I'm picturing\", \"a Godzilla movie where it's like a black\", 'hole with like little arms and legs.', \"And they're both fighting each other,\", \"but instead of the city, it's space.\", \"That's where my brain is going. And\", 'instead of, you know, moving at sort of', 'human or an, you know, Godzilla speeds,', 'they are moving at the speed of light.', 'You know, the amount of energy it takes', 'to accelerate a little electron in our', 'sort of, you know, experiments to the', 'speed of light. And to think we do it', \"with something that's 30 times the mass\", \"of our sun. So there's no greater\", 'particle accelerator than the universe', 'itself. Indeed.', 'Is it is there a is it making a sound', 'when it happens? No. And the reason is', 'that but wait a minute. You guys put a', \"soundtrack to that wave. That's\", 'different than whether it made the', 'sound. Well, then get then get us out of', 'that little that media ploy because I', 'always have to undo things that the', 'media does or give context for it', 'because people say, \"Well, I if space is', 'is a vacuum and because they knew that', 'sound doesn\\'t hear you scream.\" Exactly.', \"That's a legit call, right, for the\", 'movie alien. Alien. So, did you endorse', 'this attachment of sound to it? How did', 'you as an educator and as a physicist,', 'where were you on that? Yeah. So you', 'know I I think of it as there are many', 'many phenomena as scientists or as', \"humans and observers that we can't\", \"directly observe. Let's take light. So\", 'we love to look at pictures of even', \"astronomical objects where they're\", \"emitting X-rays. We can't see X-rays. So\", 'we color it blue. We can see blue and', 'then the object looks blue and we', \"imagine that's an X-ray. And so when I\", 'think about sound or the sound of these,', \"you know, waves, it's an encoding. It's\", 'a way of of mapping it onto senses that', \"we do have. Okay. Right. So that's how,\", \"you know, cuz otherwise that's fair\", 'enough. You know, so I mean, think about', 'the way that we visualize a cell. We', \"can't just look at at a blob of stuff\", \"and say that, you know, that's the cell.\", \"We've used microscopes. We've used ways\", 'of observing and then we put together a', \"picture. We've enhanced our feeble\", 'senses. Exactly. To gain access to the', 'universe that would otherwise lay', 'forever invisible in plain sight. But', \"it's dangerous cuz if you pick the wrong\", 'sound, then nobody cares. Like if you', 'make a video of two black holes', 'colliding and it', 'goes, you got to pick the right sound.', 'Something out of a Tom and Jerry.', 'Exactly.', \"Augaing. Doesn't work. So with LIGO,\", \"alls well that ends well. But it didn't\", 'begin smoothly. I remember there were', 'physicists called to Congress to defend', 'the budget outlay to the National', 'Science Foundation that was going to', 'take huge chunks of money to pay for', 'your laser toy. How did you convince', \"them you weren't building a Death Star?\", 'Yeah. So, so a couple of things. Um it', 'is certainly part of the history of LIGO', 'that so what what I know of the history', 'is that Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne two of', 'the founders of LIGO. Ray Weiss was an', 'experimentalist thinking about how you', 'might measure gravitational waves. They', 'share the Nobel Prize, right? And they', 'share the Nobel Prize and Kip Thorne was', 'thinking about the astrophysics. What', 'would gravitational waves look like if', 'two neutron stars or black holes', 'collided? And they met uh somewhat', 'accidentally in 1975. Uh the story goes', 'that they um they had to share a hotel', 'room because one of their bookings got', 'messed up and then they were up all', 'night conjuring up h how one would make', \"this measurement and that's where the\", 'concept of this 4 kilometer long', 'detector 2 and a half mile long detector', 'LIGO was born. What intrigues me here is', 'at the time, because I remember because', \"I'm that old, there was someone at the\", 'University of Maryland, Joe Weber, who', 'was building a gravitational wave', 'detector. And it was a cylinder of', 'aluminum with very, highly sensitive', \"servos, if that's the word, that\", 'monitored the position of this slab of', 'aluminum. And if a gravitational wave', 'washed over it, it would jiggle it in', 'such a way that he would then measure it', 'by way of these servos. So this method', 'conjured in the wee hours of the morning', 'in a hotel room is a completely', 'different method. Correct. And maybe', \"there's no way you could have detected\", 'it with a slab a cylindrical slab of', 'aluminum. I I think now in hindsight we', 'can say that would have been quite I', \"mean we haven't done that yet, right?\", 'Okay. So, but so it is true that Joe', 'Weber at the University of Maryland had', 'this big slab of metal and it was', 'instrumented with with sensors that', 'would see this big slab of metal ringing', 'just like if you if you hit a wine glass', 'and it sort of rings a tone. So, it', 'would ring at when because of the', 'gravitational wave that went through it.', \"Now it turned out that that Weber's\", 'claim people so when Weber made the', 'claim a lot of people started to build', 'similar instruments and to try to to', 'reproduce the measurements and they', \"couldn't and eventually it it people\", \"just didn't believe it. If I remember\", 'correctly he had a paper saying he had a', 'measurement. He had a me measurement and', 'I if I recall correctly the claim was we', 'have a measurement and not only do we', 'have a measurement but it seems like the', 'wave is coming from the center of our', 'galaxy which was sort of seen as a', 'preferred location for some', 'gravitationally heavy object like a', \"black hole but people just couldn't\", 'reproduce it. But what it did do is it', 'really sparked interest in the topic and', 'and so a large number of people started', 'to build these and they not all null', 'results are bad if they stimulate', 'interest is is the lesson there. I think', \"that's right. And even in in Weber's\", 'case though eventually it turned out to', 'be incorrect claims he invented some', 'techniques that even to this day we', 'still we still use. So okay you', 'mentioned something very important about', \"science. One researcher's result does\", 'not make the truth. Yes. You need', 'verification', 'because anything could they could be', 'biased. The current could have', 'fluctuated. Anything could have happened', 'in one case, but if you have two, three,', 'four, and if they give the same result,', 'you got something good. If nobody can', \"match the result, it's time to move on.\", \"That's right. And in Weber's case, I\", 'think it was even more interesting', 'because he had two of these bar', 'detectors. And it was only when people', 'built third, fourth, fifths, and they', 'were built with slightly different', 'technologies and perhaps even with', 'slightly different', 'expectations that it was understood that', 'no one was reproducing what what was. So', 'now in LEGO, when you made your grand', 'announcement, two black holes colliding,', \"why should we believe you? Cuz I Where's\", 'the Is there another LIGO to check what', 'you did? Yes. Oh, well, there it is. How', 'many of these lasers are there? Okay.', \"Yes, there is. Next. We're done there.\", 'Nice.', 'Uh, no, there was foresight there. Of', 'course, the the LIGO facility I visited', 'was in Louisiana outside of New Orleans.', 'But you would have a whole other one. If', 'that one LIGO facility makes a', 'detection, you would presume and expect', 'another LIGO to make the detection as', 'well. Correct. Not necessarily in the', 'same moment, separated by almost', 'certainly not in the same moment because', \"there's another LIGO facility in\", 'Washington state east of Seattle. And', 'you can think about sort of if you think', \"about a wave that's coming through the\", 'earth, a gravitational wave does that.', 'If a gravitational wave is emitted by', 'some distant source, light is actually', 'quite difficult for astronomers because', 'uh light coming to us interacts with', 'everything in between. Gravitational', 'waves just pass through most things. Oh,', 'so they are quite useful. You have a', 'pure expression of what happened at its', \"source. Yes. But it's a double-edged\", 'sword because by the same, you know,', \"token, it doesn't interact very strongly\", \"with our detector either. So, it's\", 'really pretty darn careful what you wish', 'for. Yeah. Right. Right. This', 'gravitational wave sounds rude. Where?', \"So the one in It's Hanford, I think. Is\", 'that the one? Yes. Hanford Hanford,', 'Washington. Washington, which I think', 'used to be a place where they purified', 'plutonium. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So are you', 'giving emotions to the gravitational', \"wave? You're declaring it's rude. Yeah.\", 'The gravitational wave just walks', 'through the party, says hi to nobody.', 'Nobody.', 'Yes. So you know that that is one of so', 'if you ask one of one of the things that', \"we haven't observed with gravitational\", 'waves is gravitational waves from the', 'very early universe say right after the', 'big bang and when we think about what we', 'know about the big bang but just to be', \"clear you haven't observed them because\", \"you don't have the capacity to do so yet\", 'not because our instrumentation just', \"isn't sensitive enough. Okay. Yeah. So\", 'if you think about what we know about', 'the big bang we what we know comes from', 'light. Now, the light that we see from', 'the Big Bang, this cosmic microwave', 'background, actually comes to us from', '400,000 years after the Big Bang. Now,', \"what happened before that, we can't tell\", 'because the universe was so hot and and', 'dense at the time that the light', \"couldn't escape. Now, what does that\", \"mean? It's exactly what you were saying,\", 'Harrison. So, the light is like going to', 'a party with an extrovert and you say,', '\"Honey, I\\'m ready to leave.\" And it\\'ll', 'be an hour before you leave the party', \"cuz they're going to stop. They're going\", 'to say hi to people on the way to saying', 'bye to people. Top off their drink.', \"Exactly. And they're not coming.\", 'Gravitational waves from the early', 'universe have been streaming to us. If', 'we could measure them in in the LIGO', 'band, they would be streaming to us from', 'when the universe was 10 the minus 22', 'seconds old. And the reason is just what', \"you said. They're like going to the\", 'party with the introvert. you say, you', \"know, we're ready to leave and you're\", \"lucky if they'll say goodbye to the\", 'host, right? So, this distinguishes our', 'access to the early universe from what', 'our normal telescopes can bring to us,', 'which is this', '400,000year barrier really. And the', 'gravitational waves would just plow', \"right past that. They don't even care.\", \"They don't they they're moving right\", 'along, right? And so if you want to see', 'the earliest moments of the universe,', 'gravitational waves are your friend. If', 'we want to make them more sensitive, do', \"we have to have bigger lasers? That's a\", \"piece of it, but there's lots of other\", 'things you got to make better, too. So', 'that kind of dubtales to to a bone I', 'have to pick with you people. Do tell', \"you quantum people. I'm in conversation\", 'with Kip Thorne and I verified because', \"I'd read this and but he's the man and I\", 'said you have all this apparatus four', 'meter four kilometer long beam that', 'reflects and they recombine you look at', 'a phase shift that and look at a jiggle', 'and I said how big is that jiggle how', 'how much did this', 'apparatus', 'move by virtue of this wave passing', 'across and it is the width', 'of 12th the diameter of a proton', \"when it's cold when it's nice outside.\", \"No, that's too big. Too\", 'big. Wait. So, so all right. So, so, so', \"let's just speak more broadly. A\", 'fraction the diameter of a nucleon of an', 'atom. Okay. A thousand. Okay. So, you', 'want to make sure nothing else is', \"responsible for what you're about to\", \"measure. Otherwise, you're measuring the\", 'wrong thing. And when I visited, they', \"were telling me if somebody's walking\", 'down the street a mile away, those', 'vibrations can be detected in that', 'exactly how they described it. But they', 'they see all vibr so they have to', 'isolate the experiment from anything', 'that could be happening from the', 'outside. Okay. So then you isolate it', 'and then you put it in a vacuum so that', 'air particles are not bumping into it.', \"So now it's there but then it is at a\", \"temperature. It's not at absolute zero.\", 'So at any temperature all everything is', 'vibrating. And even if you tamp that', \"down there's always a quantum\", 'uncertainty about the position of a', 'particle. Heisenberg told us this. Okay.', 'So you if you want to know exactly what', \"a particle is doing, there's an\", 'uncertainty to that. So how are you', 'making measurements that are smaller', 'than the quantum uncertainty allows? And', 'I we we had this conversation and Kip', 'Thorne said, \"Well, we did blah blah', 'blah and we did this and in that way we', 'cheated the quantum laws.\" And I say,', '\"No,', \"no, then it's not a law if it bends at\", 'your will.\" So what was he talking', 'about? Yeah, we do that.', 'This is like invasion of the body', \"snatchers. Yes, he's one of\", 'I think freeze like one of us. One of us', 'we we both can bend the rules of quantum', 'physics. So, okay, for those of you who', 'have such powers, please explain to me.', 'Yeah, it like in as plainest English as', 'you can. Yeah. So, let me let I I can', 'try to do that. So what quantum', 'mechanics tells us is that if you', 'measure two particular properties of a', 'particle and in in in one example would', \"be the energy of let's talk about\", 'photons because it turns out in LIGO at', \"the moment we're limited by the quantum\", 'mechanics of the light. The quantum', \"mechanics of the mirror isn't yet a\", 'problem because the mirrors are still', 'moving more than their quantum', \"properties would allow. Okay. So let's\", \"let's talk about the light. Um the\", 'quantization of the light says a light', 'has two properties. Lights made up of', 'photons. And if I want to make a', 'measurement of that, I want to know two', 'things about it. What was the energy of', \"the photons that I'm measuring? And when\", 'did they arrive on my detector? And you', \"can't know those two things at the same\", 'time with infinite precision with', 'perfect Exactly. with perfect knowledge.', 'But you can know one of those properties', 'very very well if you allow the other', 'one to be very unknown that quantum', \"mechanics allows you to do and that's\", 'the trick we play. So if we are', 'interested as we are in our measurement', 'measuring the phase of the light wave', 'the phase would be because you have two', 'light beams and you have to see how they', \"match up. That's right. Because if they\", 'match up perfectly nothing happened to', 'one relative to the other. Gotcha. But', 'if if if a wave washes over, then one', 'jiggles a little differently and you', \"will the waves don't match up that\", \"you'll see the Okay. So, right. So,\", \"that's exactly right. So say if you're\", 'interested in in measuring the phase', 'then what you can do is you can create', 'light with properties where you let the', 'amplitude or the energy of of of the', \"wave be very unknown but you've you've\", 'traded off traded that off for precision', 'in the phase and we have learned how to', 'make instruments that can do that. Damn.', \"So they're instruments that increase\", 'uncertainty they in one in one variable.', \"That's right. And and reduce it in the\", \"other variable. And that's really\", 'important. If you were reducing the the', 'quantum uncertainty in both variables at', 'the same time, you would be violating', 'the laws of physics. But that we are not', \"doing. Okay. You're just bending the\", 'laws of physics. We not breaking the', \"laws at all. No, no. It's that a\", 'loophole. I like to say this is a', 'quantum loophole. Admit it. Well, no.', 'I Oh, she got angry. You got a custom', 'attitude on for increasing the', 'uncertainty.', 'I I call it manipulating the laws of', \"quantum physics because we can't violate\", 'them. And loopholes are things that are', \"just usually things you haven't thought\", \"of. Yeah. Whereas this we've thought of.\", \"We're deliberately doing this. And you\", \"know, so that's the kind of So it's not\", \"a problem if you don't know at all what\", \"the So there's a price to pay. The price\", \"to pay is look if you're interested in\", 'measuring the phase and if by accident', \"because your measurement apparatus isn't\", 'perfect you start to collect a little', 'bit of information about the amplitude', \"it won't work for you anymore because\", 'remember the amplitude is now very very', 'noisy. Wow. Okay. So so this is what we', 'do. We reduce the noise in the quantity', \"we're most interested in measuring. We\", \"stuff it into the quantity we're trying\", 'not to measure. Okay. And then we try to', 'do that as well as we can. grabbing', 'quantum physics by the horns. Yes. And', 'making it bend to your will. You know,', 'almost we call it squeezing. We squeeze', 'the light.', \"Let's get the picture of this now. You\", \"have two beams. Yeah. They're at right\", 'angles, I presume. Yeah. Yes. And the', 'round trip is is 8 km. Is that right? Or', 'Okay. And so it takes time for the me', 'very measured time for the light to do', 'that. This is a single laser beam of', 'light that has been split. Correct. It', 'has been split. And not only does it go', \"4 kilometers down and come back, there's\", 'an added complication, if you will,', 'which is that in that 4 kilometer span,', 'we have a pair of mirrors that are', 'facing each other. And just like when', 'you put your own head between two', 'mirrors and you see multiple images, the', 'light is bouncing multiple times between', \"those. It's a way of of increasing the\", 'path length, if you will. All right. So', 'and so it bounces in our case in LIOS', 'case about 100 times. Okay. So but then', 'it has to come back through to recon to', 're to recombine. Yes. Okay. So you have', 'your magic waves that you it goes up and', 'back 100 times. Then at some point the', 'light has to come back through and not', 'reflect back. Correct. And then you', 'compare the waves of the light from the', \"two the two arms. Yeah. So that's the\", 'shift. So how much different would one', 'wave have to be from the other to be the', 'gravitational wave to be the effect of', 'the gravitational wave? Yeah. So so the', 'the way you can think of it is that the', \"output of our our instrument we're\", 'measuring you think of the light as two', 'sine waves one from each arm and we', 'arrange the the distances such that the', 'two light waves cancel. So the peak of', 'one sits on the trough of the other and', 'in the ideal case you would see no light', 'zero right and then if one arm is', 'slightly different in in line then they', \"don't perfect and now some light sort of\", 'trickles out brilliant right exactly I', 'should get a Nobel Prize for that they', 'already did', \"you're tied with Einstein\", \"tied so it's always better to see a\", \"signal where there isn't otherwise a\", 'signal than to measure the difference', 'between two large signals. Yeah. If you', 'try to measure a tiny difference in a', \"big number, it's really hard to measure.\", \"But you start with something that's very\", 'close too. Yes. You start with something', \"that's very close to zero and now you\", 'get anything. You got something. Wow. So', \"that's what we do. And how strong is\", 'that extra signal compared with the', 'amplitude of the waves to begin with? So', 'what fraction of that amplitude is?', \"Yeah. Well, that's that's a sort of a\", 'technical detail because you start off', 'with, you know, 100 watts of laser light', \"and by the time you That's a powerful\", \"laser. Yeah, that's a very powerful I\", \"believe laser particularly if if it's a\", \"laser that's also, you know, as as\", 'quiet, noisefree as ours. What is my', 'laser pointer? Your laser pointer is', 'like a millowatt. Yeah. Yeah. Millatt.', 'Okay. A really bright one. A few', 'thousand a few thousand of a watt,', 'right? Gotcha. And this is 100 watts.', 'Yeah. So this is 100 watts at the laser.', 'And by the time the light has bounced', 'between all the mirrors and so on, at at', 'any given instant in time, you you could', 'have, you know, hundreds of kilowatts of', 'power circulating in the instrument. But', 'at the time that we detected at the', \"output, you know, we're trying to go\", 'for, you know, very little light, close', \"to zero. We're measuring something\", 'around of order 10ish mills of light.', 'Okay. But relative to the hundreds of', 'thousands of millows that are moving', \"around. That's right. The more\", 'interesting question is you can think', 'about the output of the inerometer is', \"itself just it has a it's a syosoidal\", 'function. And so the way I like to think', 'about it is we try to park ourselves at', 'a trough and then at the bottom and then', \"we're asking what is the smallest amount\", 'of of of light that you can distinguish', 'resolve and that is how much of phase or', \"distance path length you're resolving.\", \"And so that's the number that\", 'corresponds to a path length difference', 'of 10 the minus 18 m which is the', 'fraction of the diameter of a proton', 'that you thousandth diameter of a', 'proton. Crazy talk. And so so she', 'slipped in a nice term in there. I want', 'to like pull that out. She mentioned', 'intererometer. Okay. that as a', 'device had to be invented and it was', 'invented at the turn of the century the', 'the previous century by m Albert', \"Michaelelsson and morally what's his\", \"first name I don't remember his first\", 'name the famous Michaelelsson morally', 'experiment they invented it to measure', 'the speed of light so the first truly', 'accurate measurement of the speed of', 'light was by Michaelson and Mley using', 'an interpherometer where they had waves', \"that either line up or they don't and\", \"the amount that they don't line up will\", 'give you information about the speed of', 'the light that they were measuring. So I', \"mean it's it's a hugely power. So they\", 'got the Nobel Prize for inventing that', 'device.', \"They're just giving these things out.\", \"I think this is the third one we've\", 'heard about today. Just handing them out', \"like candy. So just I I I'm I'm just\", 'impressed by how all this comes', \"together. I think it's just a reminder\", 'to us that every discovery we make is', 'built on everything that came before,', \"right? Because we we've talked about so\", 'many things that were invented 100 years', 'ago that were important to the', 'discoveries we made in 2015. All right.', 'So take us out with your prediction of', 'what what discoveries await us to take', 'the physics we now know into a new place', 'or what new physics needs to', 'arrive to take our understanding of the', 'universe to a new place. Yeah. So I', 'would say at the moment the kinds of', \"objects astrophysical objects we've seen\", 'so far have been collisions of pairs of', 'black holes or pairs of neutron stars or', 'maybe neutron stars and black holes in', 'in the same binary system and those were', 'predicted. We kind of expected them but', 'even that has given us mysteries like', \"I'll give you an example. We've seen\", 'black holes that are around 100 solar', \"masses. We don't know how nature forms\", \"those because if they're formed in the\", 'same way as black holes that are 20 or', \"30 solar masses are formed. Stars don't\", \"do that. Right. We don't that it that it\", \"means we don't understand how stars are\", \"born. That's\", 'right. Right. Right. I always thought', \"it's like you pick up an instrument and\", 'you practice a lot how how stars born.', \"Oh how that works. I think there's been\", 'three films of that.', 'Yeah. They keep making the films,', 'right? Stars.', \"What I'm saying is we've had three films\", 'to learn how a star is. But but let me', 'just remind you that movie stars are', 'called stars because we had stars first.', 'Okay? We we came first, not because', \"they're filled of gas.\", 'Hot', \"gas. They're named after objects in the\", 'universe, not vice versa. Just to be', 'clear. But Neil, I think this is a good', 'idea for for you. I think you need to', 'make the ultimate A Star Is Born movie', \"about real stars. Oh, if we're going to\", 'make the movie again, just make it', \"right. Yeah, I agree. I'll be the one in\", 'love with the stuff.', 'Well, thank you for enlightening us here', 'with uh your insights and your expertise', 'and your deenship. Oh my gosh.', \"What I'd like to do is sort of take us\", 'out with a cosmic perspective if I may.', 'This is the part where I just talk to', \"camera and you just pretend like you're\", 'paying', 'attention. Once again, we are exposed to', 'major modern discoveries in science,', 'physics in particular, that was', 'enabled', 'by creative thinking that preceded it.', 'uh creative', 'engineering uh improvements in', 'computational', 'speed. These things', 'happen. Yeah, you can say I got a really', 'fast computer and you can be praised for', 'that. But maybe someone can use that for', 'something that they could not have', 'solved before. I have a new idea about', 'how black holes work. Well, let others', 'know about it because somebody could', 'have another idea about how to apply', \"that to a discovery we're not even\", 'thinking about now. And so this', 'interconnectivity, this', 'interdependence of cosmic discovery on', 'these multiple frontiers is how science', 'works. People ask, are we approaching', 'the end of science?', 'Well, if you think everything that will', 'ever be discovered has been discovered,', 'then you probably think that. But my', 'read of the history of this exercise', 'tells me', 'that if you think science is about to', \"end, it's because you're not creative\", 'enough to imagine where else it could', 'go. And look at all the dangling bits', 'and pieces of all the scientific', 'frontiers and how they might one day', 'come together with a next generation', 'Einstein to take us into the next', 'millennium', 'of cosmic', \"discovery and that's a cosmic\", 'perspective. So Energis thanks for', 'coming back to Star Talk. We dovetailed', 'another uh talk you were giving at NYU', 'sister institution downtown. Thanks for', 'fitting us into your day.

So, we feel this is about', 'just about right. This is the right', 'time. Yeah. And then we combed the', 'streets and we found this guy. Yeah.', 'Harrison Greenbound. Not your first', 'rodeo with us. No. No. We love you,', 'Harrison. And you just finished a', 'production. Yeah. My off Broadway uh', 'magic show. What just happened? What', 'just happened?

I went to\", 'Space Camp. You went to Space Camp?', \"Okay. You're in the right place. There's\", 'a street credentials for this show. All', 'right. All right. So, so Gary, what is', 'the setup for today? In previous shows,', 'we have looked at many forms of', 'intelligence, uh, both artificial or', 'otherwise. Um, but where does', 'intelligence start? For that answer, we', 'look to the tree of life. More', 'specifically, trees and plants. Uh, we', 'know literal trees. Yes. Not just the', 'figurative tree of life. The metaphoric', 'kind. No, we know plants are aware of', 'their surroundings. But how deep does it', 'go? Can they communicate? Can they', 'count? Can they feel pain? Can they', 'learn? Do they have memory? What happens', 'if we send them into', 'space? Do plants know they are in space?', 'And how does this impact future food', 'production for space flight? This means', \"expert time. And I must warn you, he's a\", 'fellow Brit, has a flowing white man and', 'a poncho for Hawaiian shirt. Neil, if', 'you will introduce our guest, Simon', 'Gilroy, welcome to Star Talk. Oh, thank', \"you for having me. Yeah, I've got you\", \"down here. You're professor of botany at\", \"the University of Wisconsin. So, there's\", \"still botonist out there. You're head of\", 'the Gilroy Science Lab. What a', 'coincidence. What are the chances of', 'that? I know.', 'Uh what we like here is uh your research', 'includes plant nutrition. Also, the why', 'we have you on this show is you think', 'about the surface of planets and and the', 'moon and what interaction a plant might', 'have with those surfaces because we', \"don't even call the surface of the moon\", \"soil. No, no. It's like pulverized rock.\", 'So, we call it', 'rigalith. Rigalith.', 'and your whole spaceleaning interest', 'interest us. And that in a way you are', 'not only an astrobiologist,', \"you're an astrobotonist. See, I didn't\", \"know astrobotonist existed until I don't\", 'want to brag here, but when I did go to', 'space camp, okay, we went on a fake', 'mission to the moon and I was the', 'astrobotist on the space shuttle. So, I', 'took care of a fake plastic plant and I', 'measured the effects of fake gravity on', 'this fake plastic plant for a full half', 'hour. And it was fake that you rode a', 'space shuttle to the moon cuz space', \"shuttles can't reach the moon. That's\", 'right. None of it was real. But I did', 'have to take measurements of a plant.', 'They did not change because we were not', 'in space and it was made of plastic. But', 'I was a good space camp an astrobotist', 'for about a half an hour. All right. So', \"So Simon, let's lay the foundation here.\", 'We know plants are alive, but how aware', 'are they? And do we have to loosen our', 'definition of the word aware to enclose', 'everything it is that they do? So that', 'we can speak of their properties in the', 'same sentences as we speak of our own', 'awareness. All biology is', 'aware if we use awareness as monitors', 'the environment around it and deals with', 'it whatever the appropriate dealing with', \"is because if you couldn't do that you\", \"can't stay alive. The environment's\", 'changing the lion is chasing you. The', \"insect is chewing on you. It's rained.\", \"It's dry. You have to monitor all the\", \"facts. So all that's an intrinsic part\", 'of being alive. You just described the', \"world's worst honeymoon.\", 'Insects chewing on you. Yeah. Lion', 'chasing me. The safari has gone ary. I', \"didn't say the world was necessarily a\", \"benign place. In fact, it isn't. That's\", \"that's why you have to be aware of\", \"what's going on. You got to roll with\", 'the good times and deal with the bad', \"times. Obvious things are they'd have to\", 'track the sun. They know when the sun is', 'up and down and the seasons. These are', 'some obvious ones. Are there other ones', 'that are less clear and present to a', 'casual viewer? Yeah. Yeah. Um, so one', 'way to think about it is that we as', 'animals, we have the luxury of movement.', \"So if stuff happens around us, you don't\", \"have to precisely know what's going on.\", \"You just have to know it's bad. And then\", 'then inevitably what we do is we vacate', 'the area where the bad stuff is', \"happening. If you're a plant, you're\", \"you're rooted to the spot. Absolutely\", 'literally rooted to the spot. So your', 'array of senses has to be broader than', 'our array of senses because you not only', 'have to deal with it, you have to know', \"exactly what's going on. So direction of\", \"the sun, uh, but what's the time of day?\", 'You have to know that because plants do', 'a lot of predictive biology. So if the', \"sun comes up, there's an absolutely\", 'fantastic video of a sunflower doing a', 'thing called solar tracking. So', 'sunflowers put their leaves and point', 'them flat towards the direction of the', 'sun. Okay? And you could go, well, that', 'feels almost like a machine, you know,', \"it's that it's just monitoring the sun's\", 'direction and pointing for the optimal', 'amount of photosynthesis. But if you', \"watch it, there's a great movies on uh\", 'online of this solar tracking during the', 'whole day. The plant actually at the end', 'of the day it goes like and the leaves', 'flop down but then it predicts where the', \"sun's going to come up and the time of\", 'dawn and it pops its leaves up', \"predictably to point to where's the sun\", \"is going to come up. So it's got an\", 'internal clock. It knows what the time', \"of day is. There's a lot of\", 'environmental factors that I think if', \"you're a gardener you would just guess\", 'it has they have to know this. They have', 'to know how much water there is. They', 'have to know what the nutrients are', \"around. It's kind of important if you're\", \"a plant to know if you're being eaten.\", \"Um, that's a big one. What the\", 'temperature is, the time of year, and', 'just you can go through a litany of of', 'environmental factors, and if you can', 'imagine that it would impact on a plant', \"success, there's going to be a sensor\", \"for it because otherwise plants wouldn't\", \"be around. All right. They're describing\", 'reaction to an environment that are all', \"positive for it. But if there's an\", 'assault on the environment, uh what kind', 'of defenses might a plant have against', \"it? So again, you imagine you're rooted\", 'to the spot. The kind of defenses that', \"you're going to have, they're not going\", 'to be avoiding. There are a couple of', 'plants that can actually do incredibly', \"rapid leak movements. There's a thing\", 'called mimosa, the sensitive plant, and', 'if you touch it in real time, it looks', 'like an animal. The leaves collapse', 'down. uh and we think that that is to', 'sort of like flick off a caterpillar or', 'make yourself just less obvious. So', \"that's a response to touch uh which is a\", \"movement related one but that's kind of\", 'the one of weird ones. The general', 'things what plants are really really', 'good at doing is making stuff.', 'Photosynthesis is an incredibly powerful', 'and productive way of doing biology. And', 'so plants build things to deal with the', 'world. So defenses can be pre-existing', 'built things, things that we would all', 'interact with, you know, things like uh', 'spines and prickles and just like the', 'barb wire approach to defending', 'yourself. Oh, okay. Of course. But then', 'one what they are real masters of is', 'chemistry and just making nasty stuff.', 'And there are an enormous number of', 'poisonous plants. all those um', 'psychoactive drugs which are extracted', \"from plants, they're not there for us,\", 'they are there as defenses and those', 'defenses can either be pre-existing, you', 'know, they can just make the chemical', \"and just go, I'm defended or what is a\", 'much sort of clever way to do it is to', \"go, I'm being attacked. I'm going to\", 'make my defensive chemical now because', 'these defenses cost me something. So,', \"I'm just going to switch them on when I\", \"need them. And so there's a lot of of\", 'inducible chemical defenses. As soon as', 'a insect or a herbivore starts chewing', \"on a plant, it knows it's being chewed\", 'on and it switches on just a ton of', 'stuff to defend itself. So none of that', 'happened with your plastic plants. Yes,', 'exactly. It stayed very actually space', 'had very little effect on it. Turns out', 'plants are great in space. Uh there was', 'zero change and the plant stayed uh', 'vertical the whole time. How about that?', 'I am nervous that plants are aware', \"because I've killed many house plants.\", \"So, does that mean they know that I'm\", 'like the Jeffrey Dmer of house plants?', 'Is that my do I have a reputation with', 'plants? We work a lot on that those sort', 'of like the sensory events and what they', 'trigger. And so, one of the things is', \"imagine you're eating a salad. You\", \"didn't cook the salad. Everything in the\", 'salad is alive. So if there is, you', 'know, that classic silent scream, that', 'silent scream is going on inside your', \"mouth as you're chewing on it because\", 'everything is alive. Does that make me', 'not eat salad? Absolutely not. You know,', 'salad healthy for you. Uh but it is so', 'easy to just sort of forget that plants', 'are alive and that all biology again now', \"there's there's this linguistic\", \"minefield that we're going to walk into\", \"and I there's no way to get around it.\", 'We should be stepping on those landmines', 'of of how we describe things because I', \"don't think there's a better way to do\", 'it. We are going to use the language of', 'human experience and human consciousness', \"and how we work because you know that's\", 'really the only relatable thing we have.', 'And so when we start talking about the', \"plants know they're being eaten, that\", 'comes with a lot of baggage. That comes', \"with you thinking you're being eaten.\", \"And you can't get away from that. That's\", 'just built into the power and the', 'problems of language. So', \"plants are sensing what's going on\", 'around them and responding. Does that', \"mean they know anything? Yeah. They're\", 'not in harmony with', \"herbivores. I I thought they that's part\", \"of the circle of life. But you're saying\", \"they're pissed off. Yeah. They're\", \"screaming for their life. I didn't\", 'realize when I was eating a salad in', 'front of a plant, it was like eating', 'sushi in front of a fish.', 'So the thing is, Simon, I mean, we know', \"plants don't have what we would\", 'classically interpret as a brain. So', 'what systems are engaged for their', 'communication, for their behavior? Uh,', \"it's a so we've now stepped to the edge\", \"of our knowledge. Um, so okay, that's\", 'the end of the show. Okay,', \"we're done here.\", 'Oh no, remember the science is stepping', 'to the edge of knowledge and then', 'hypothesizing what the next step should', 'be. So we we I think we literally have', \"step to kind of we're getting into the\", \"point of where there's active research\", \"and debate about what's going on. So we\", 'know a lot of the molecular machinery. I', \"want to pose Gary's question more\", 'precisely. All right. So we attribute', 'our sensory world', 'to', 'neurochemical synaptic phenomena in a', 'very complex nervous system that we call', 'our brain. Given that if we look at', \"plants where we know there's no\", 'corresponding', 'uh gathering of of of neurons then in', 'order to port our emotional state and', 'our sensory vocabulary onto a plant and', 'to do that uh botanically in a way that', 'makes botanical sense. Are you gonna', 'have to point where that is sensing it', \"and by what electrochemical means it's\", \"reaction it's it's reacting? So we know\", 'some of the the nuts and bolts the', 'machinery. So I can tell you how does', 'the plant sense light. I can tell you', 'the proteins it uses just like', 'biomedical researcher could tell you how', 'your eye works at that level. You know', 'the the nuts and bolts of photons coming', 'in flipping chemical bonds generating', \"signals. We also know that there's long\", 'distance signaling with implants. So if', \"you again my favorite example is it's so\", \"it's so easy to think about but so\", 'complicated a caterpillar chewing on a', \"leaf. That's a very local event. So if\", \"you imagine it's you imagine like you\", 'know like a lion chewing on your', \"fingers, right? It's a very local piece\", 'of stimulation but it spreads throughout', 'your entire body because you have a a', 'nervous system that transmits', \"information. So, we know plants don't\", \"have nerves, they don't have a brain,\", 'but they have that long-distance', 'signaling system because they have the', \"same problem that you know if you've got\", \"a local piece of information, it's kind\", 'of important that the entire organism', \"knows what's going on. The long distance\", 'component of it is absolutely not', 'nerves. We know what nerves are and they', \"just simply don't exist in a plant. We\", 'know what a brain is. There is no brain', 'in a plant um at the anatomical level.', 'But there is a long-distance signaling', 'system. And for that wounding system, we', \"know what it is. And it turns out it's\", 'the plumbing system inside the plant', 'with liquid flowing in it. That liquid', 'carries chemical signals. Uh, and this', 'is where you go like really. One of the', 'chemical signals for damage is an amino', \"acid glutamate. That's like the MSG that\", 'you put on your food to make it taste', \"yummy. Um, that's a basic building block\", 'of plants. But when you damage a plant', 'cell, it leaks it out. MSG but without', 'the MS. Yes. Okay. So just G. Just G.', 'Glutamate. Okay. The G. So that that', 'glutamate is flowing through the plant', 'and it triggers longdistance responses.', 'So you can go to do a big analogy that', 'feels almost like nerve conduction,', \"right? It's a very different thing, but\", 'it feels like the long distance um', 'conduction. Glutamate is a', 'neurotransmitter. You have it firing off', 'in your sinapses at the moment', 'transmitting information between nerves.', \"And there's a protein that has to be the\", 'receptor. And in our nervous system,', 'that is a thing called, strangely', 'enough, a glutamate receptor. Uh, and', 'the glutamate receptors have a chemical', 'binding site, the amino acid, and it', 'switches on their activity.', 'plants have almost identical', 'proteins that bind glutamate and the', 'glutamate triggers their activity and', 'glutamate is part of this long-distance', 'signaling system. So, you know, there', \"there's lots of parallels about how\", \"things work, but it there's a\", 'fundamental difference which is no', 'nerves and no neurons. And if you think', 'that what your brain is doing is', 'building a model of the world somehow', 'encoded inside you is a model of the', 'world that you can interrogate and get', \"an idea about what's going on. Somehow\", 'that must be true inside plants. It must', 'be true inside bacteria that somehow', 'they must have some kind of but now it', 'gets very philosophical. Some model that', 'they use in order to work out how the', 'world is working around them to respond', \"to it. But it's got to be it it's not\", 'resident in a brain. Hey, start talking', 'ends.

And what we are going to do is', 'have a lot of fun while we solve the', \"world's problems. So help me unf the\", 'earth and join me on April 24th. Okay.', 'Okay. So the most aggressive plants we', \"we've all learned from childhood is I\", 'guess the Venus fly trap. Is this Oh', \"yeah. But that's got we see it visually\", 'and we fascinated by fascinated. But I', \"think Simon's going to tell us something\", \"that we don't readily understand about\", 'the Venus fly trap. Really? Yeah. Bust', 'my bubble here. But can the Venus fly', 'trap actually count? Absolutely.', \"Don't say that like everybody knows\", 'that. What? What? Everybody in his lab', 'knows that. No way. He said that stupid.', \"You didn't know that? Well, he was\", 'talking to me, not you. No worries. Has', 'that a mouth go what?', \"So, but like again it's like absolutely\", 'it counts. What does it mean to count?', 'And so that Venus fly trap, the trap', 'thing, is actually some modified leaves.', 'Evolution has turned them into this', \"amazing trap. It's crazy. It's awesome.\", 'You know, it shuts at our time scale,', \"which is why it's fascinating to us\", 'because it moves sort of plant responses', 'into something that that feels almost', 'animallike. How does it close like that', 'at that speed then? It closes. So, one', 'of the things that blow your mind, it', 'grows shut. What? All right. which just', \"go like that can't be true. It uses the\", 'machinery that elsewhere in the plant is', 'used to make cells get bigger and to', 'grow. And at the base of the trap are', 'some very specialized cells which are', 'just pumped up to incredibly high', \"pressures of water. And we're talking\", 'about pressures that are in the realms', 'of you like 10 times the air pressure in', 'your car tire. Just amazingly pumped up', 'ready to go cells. And the machinery', 'just kind of loosens up the walls around', 'the cells so that they can expand', 'incredibly quickly. Uh and so that that', 'levering shut is cells getting bigger,', 'which is irreversible change in size,', 'which in the botanical world we call', 'growth. But the cool thing about it is', \"you imagine you've got the Venus fly\", \"trap and the traps open and it's windy\", 'or something like that and the leaf', \"falls into the trap. That' be crazy for\", 'the plant to trap a leaf. But the trap', 'responds to touch. It responds to a fly', \"touching it. So what's happened is that\", 'there are little sensory hairs on the', 'inner surface of the trap. And when a', 'fly touches them once, the plant', \"triggers a response, but it doesn't\", 'trigger the shutting of the trap. It', 'triggers a chemical signal. If the fly', 'touches the hair again within a time', 'frame about 30 seconds, that then', 'triggers a second reinforcing signal and', 'that triggers the shutting of fat. So in', 'order to get the trap to shut, the plant', \"has to count to two. I mean, it's the\", 'minimal counting you can imagine. Maybe', 'the minimal counting is one. So yeah,', \"there's a chemical uh signal memory\", \"that's built up. When you get down to\", \"the machinery of it, it doesn't sound\", \"quite so magic, right? It's you trigger\", 'something, you get part almost to a', 'threshold and then you trigger it again', 'and you pass the threshold, but it is', \"counting. It's it's accumulating two\", 'pieces of information. So Simon, do', 'plants then begin to learn and can they', 'retain in a in a form of what we would', 'call a memory? Can they go from two to', 'calculus? I know, not quite that. Can we', \"teach them algebra? Algebra. They're\", \"they're not into complex differential\", \"equations. Yeah, they're like most\", 'teenagers. Um, we will now firmly walk', 'into the minefield of linguistic issues', \"because we're going to talk about\", \"learning and memory and eventually it's\", \"you just you can't help but process it.\", 'Well, I know what memory is. I remember', 'things and I know what learning is. I', \"learn things. We'll keep that in the\", \"background. But I'm just going to use\", 'those words because what else? These are', 'your disclaimers. We get that. So we', \"don't think you're crazy new age person\", 'off a farm somewhere. I am I now the the', 'long hair mustache and Hawaiian shirt', 'are doing that.', 'You look like if weird saw a ghost and I', 'love it. My disclaimer is just so that', 'you are like have that filter in there.', 'So that like when we talk about well', 'what does what does memory mean? Does', 'memory mean an event has occurred', 'encoding it in your biology and then', 'using that information later? If I', 'define that as what memory is, right?', \"Which may not be the memory that you're\", \"thinking about. you're thinking about\", 'the memory of emotions and stuff like', 'that and past experiences. But if it was', \"something happens, it's encoded within\", 'the biology and there is a response to', 'it later on or it changes other', \"responses later on. That's what biology\", \"does, right? That's how you survive as\", \"an organism is you adapt to what's going\", \"on around you. The world's constantly\", \"changing. We've already established it's\", 'not always a nice place. And so being', 'able to change what you do with a', \"history of what's gone on, that's just\", 'part of being alive. So, uh, plants do', 'that, bacteria do that. So, the answer', 'is yes. Yeah. But then when you start', 'talking about memory, you begin to layer', 'on all of these other things, which gets', 'a little bit complicated. But if we just', 'limit ourselves to that, plants have', \"memory. Whether it's cold will determine\", 'what happens next many months down the', 'road. So, if you imagine um there are a', 'bunch of seeds in the soil at the', 'moment, some of them have a very clever', 'way of working out when they should', 'germinate. They want to produce a little', \"seedling in the spring when it's nice\", 'and warm. And so, you could go, \"Oh,', \"that seed's just going to sit in the\", \"soil and it's going to wait for it to be\", 'nice and warm.\" But nice and warm', 'increasingly is happening in the middle', 'of winter and it gets cold again. So if', 'it all you did was not have any kind of', 'concept of anything what is going on', \"around you other than oh today it's nice\", \"and warm I'm going to germinate you make\", 'a tiny little seedling and then that', 'seedling would freeze. So the a lot of', 'plants the seeds go into the soil and', 'they have to accumulate a long freezing', 'cold period and you can go well what', \"they're doing is they're sensing that\", \"the temperature has got cold and they're\", \"remembering that it's got cold for a\", 'long period of time and once that memory', 'is in established then when it gets warm', \"again ah now we're probably in the\", \"spring and we're not in that weird you\", \"know like it's got warm for three days\", \"and now it's minus 20° again. So there's\", 'very clear that biology has memory at', \"that level. Learning again that's a\", 'complicated one because generally in the', 'world of learning the learning that we', \"immediately think about again it's sort\", 'of built into how we talk about it is', 'experiential learning which is what we', 'do where we experience something we take', 'that information in we processes it and', 'then that helps us do something in the', \"future. there's much less evidence for\", 'that sort of of process in plants but', \"again we're talking about this\", 'experiential component of it which is a', 'very very sort of animal human concept', \"so we're discussing here the internal\", 'systems of plants but if we throw that', 'out into the communial aspect of it do', \"they and how do they I'm guessing it's\", 'again biochemical communicate between', 'them or do they have other strategies', 'that they employ Yeah. Yeah. There', \"there's there's no no question that they\", \"talk to each other. Uh the again, you're\", 'right. The chemistry is going to be the', \"way they do it. That's also how I\", 'communicate with chemistry. With', 'chemistry.', \"You know, if you mow a lawn, there's\", 'that classic smell of new mow lawn. So,', \"what you're interacting then is with\", 'this the volatiles that have come from', 'damaged plants. Uh and we know', 'chemically what those are. One of those', 'is a group of chemicals based around', 'hexadanal. And and if you smelt those', 'chemicals just in a lab, in a chemistry', 'lab, and you pulled out the the hexanowl', 'thing and smelt it, it would totally', 'smell of pneumon grass. If you take that', 'pure chemical and you treat a completely', 'intact, undamaged plant with it, it will', 'switch on a bunch of damage related', 'responses as if it was being attacked.', \"Lawns really didn't evolve to be mowed.\", \"When you cut them, they think they're\", 'being eaten and so they switch on the', 'damage related stuff of being eaten. So', 'the smell is just a bunch of silent', 'screaming death. Yeah, exactly. For', 'their lives. So take that chemical,', 'treat another plant with it, it will', 'switch on preemptive defenses. They have', 'an internal uh stress hormone, a defense', 'hormone called jasmmonic acid, which is', 'you can you know what it smells like.', \"It's in blood of and what is that\", 'chemical? Jasmmonic acid. Oh yes. So the', 'the a large proportion will get switched', \"on. I only remember that because that's\", 'my drag name. Jasmmonic acid. Jasmmonic', 'acid. Very good.', 'All right. So chemical given off by a', 'damaged plant switches on responses', 'another plant. Is that plant the', 'original plant communicating in the like', 'hand wavy way? Yeah. But I think we', 'would we would class it in a group of', 'communication called eavesdropping,', \"which is that there's there's no it's\", 'very difficult to talk about it without', \"making it sound human. There's no intent\", 'to pass information between those two', \"plants. It's just like go back to the\", 'lion chewing on your hand. Again, if the', \"lion's chewing on your hand and you\", \"scream, you aren't using the screen to\", 'inform everyone else around you that the', 'lion is chewing on you. But everyone', 'else around you can use that information', \"to understand what's going on. So that\", 'chemical sort of communication at that', 'level we I think we would think that is', 'this eavesdropping phenomenon which is', 'the information is useful and plants', 'have evolved to use it more plant-to-l', 'communication. Well we know that for', 'instance there are fungal bridges', 'between plants that work underground.', 'These things called microisal fungi.', \"They help the plant. They're in a\", 'interaction with plant roots where the', 'plant feeds the fungus. The fungus helps', 'the plant. Is this the same thing as the', 'mcelium? The mcelium. Exactly the same', 'thing. Yeah. And but you called it', 'something else. What did you call it?', 'Microisal fungus. Microisal fungus.', \"Okay. I It's probably like Latin or\", 'Swuahili or something for fungus weed.', \"Okay. But the it's a very very close\", \"association. It's one of the oldest\", 'associations symbioses that we know of', 'plants. It probably happened as soon as', 'plants came onto the lab. So information', 'will flow from plant to plant through', 'that that intermediary through that', 'fungus. But again, if we talk about', 'communication, there is this sort of um', \"language component to it where we're\", 'putting intent in there and that may not', 'that may not be the right sort of', 'framework to put in what is happening', 'there. it it might just be again be e', 'eased dropping. What about plants versus', 'plants? Uh so plants know that other', 'plants are near them and they have other', 'things other than the chemistry to do', 'that. And one of them is light. So if', 'you imagine the closer plants get to', 'each other, the more one plant is', 'absorbing light relative to the other.', 'It actually changes the spectrum of', 'light that that each plant is seeing', 'because some of the spectrum is being', \"absorbed, some of it's being\", 'transmitted. So the quality of light', 'changes depending on how close you are', 'to another plant. And one of the big', 'agricultural uh success stories which is', 'going to sound a little like is that all', \"it is but it's absolutely amazing. The\", 'reason that pl that corn crops have gone', 'up. One of them is that we can plant', 'plants the corn closer to each other.', \"And one of the things that's helped us\", 'do that is an understanding of this this', 'sort of proximity sensing the plants', 'have around them and working out how to', 'get around that so that we can basically', 'shove the corn plants really really', 'close to each other. I just scored so', 'many points with my Nebraskan in-laws', 'that we went to corn. This is this is', \"fantastic. They're going to be so\", 'excited. They really love corn there.', \"They love it so much. So Simon, we've\", \"we've discussed about plant smarts,\", 'intelligence, etc.', 'But your lab, the famously named Gilroy', 'Lab, um does a lot of work with plants', 'in space. And the very first day', \"question is, do plants know they're in\", 'space? If you do actually take them out', 'there? And just to be clear, yes,', 'generally when we think of space,', \"because we're trained to think this way,\", 'we think of a weightless environment.', \"Yeah. But if you if you're either in a\", 'rotating space station or your rockets', 'are firing, Yeah. You could do that at', '1G. And so the space environment can be', 'thought of as zero G and or regular G,', 'but then other phenomenon like you have', \"to control the sunlight because you're\", 'not on a rotating Earth, you know. So', \"you're whipping you be whipping around\", 'it. Yeah. So how did you get interested', 'in space? Did you go to space camp with', 'with with', 'with Harrison?', 'I was that plastic. Yes, I took very', 'good care of you for at least 30', 'minutes.', \"As everyone will appreciate who's\", 'listening to this podcast, space is an', 'awesome place. Everything is funner in', 'space. Everything. Yeah. You you can do', 'awesome experiments you could never do', 'on the surface of the earth. And for a', 'biologist, it moves into a realm', 'where there is no history for biology to', 'draw on about how to deal with it, which', 'is a very very weird mental space to go.', \"There is a movie. It's called Little\", 'Shop of Horse and that space plant was', 'very dangerous.', 'So I mean what what are we confronted', \"with as now? Now I'm a plant. I've\", 'joined the group. Um we one of us one of', 'us not grown here. So I mean radiation', \"you've got zero G is I mean there's no\", \"up there's no down right. How are we\", 'working with with our with our light', 'intake? Do we need water to grow plants', \"once we're off world? What go on what\", 'are our challenges? So everything that', \"you know that if you're a gardener\", 'everything that you know is important in', 'space. So what do plants need? They need', 'light, water, nutrients. They need', 'something to grow into. All of that is', \"going to be important. But we're going\", 'to move into a realm and the one that we', 'uh uh concentrating a lot on at the', 'moment is that microgravity, the zerog', 'weightless environment. Uh and then', \"we're beginning to now transition to\", 'thinking about things like the surface', 'of the moon. But if you think about the', \"weightless environment, that's a very\", 'weird environment. You know, very', 'annoying. A lot of times physics gets in', 'the way of a good idea. Uh deal with', 'deal with it.', 'Physics is the ultimate judge, jury, and', 'executioner of your ideas. Just want you', 'to know. And the executioner bit is the', \"one that we're worried about. So a lot\", 'of things you take for granted on Earth', 'are going to be different in a', 'weightless environment. And what the one', 'that just seems so trivial, but actually', 'turns out to be a really really big deal', 'is water. Because on Earth, you know, if', 'I say think of flowing water, almost', 'inevitably the picture in your mind is', \"going to be something that's driven by\", \"gravity. It'll be a river flowing or the\", \"ocean and tides and waves. Uh, and we're\", 'going to remove that. And so the', 'characteristics of water in space is it', 'the molecular forces within water take', 'over things like hydrogen bonding and', 'stuff like that. But the great way to', 'think about it is that in space, water', 'is creepy and sticky. So, it wants to', 'stick to surfaces and it wants to creep', 'over surfaces. So, imagine I just to do', \"a thought experiment of you've got your\", \"plant in a pot and you're going to water\", \"it and you've got your watering can.\", 'Well, first of all, you turn the', 'watering can aside. Nothing comes out', \"because can't pull the water out with\", \"gravity. So, I'll give you a syringe and\", 'you can squirt the water into the soil', 'and that will totally work. But now', 'rather than just sort of sitting in the', 'soil and being drawn down as it does on', 'Earth, the water is going to stick to', 'the soil particles and then capillary', 'forces are going to take it over the', \"surface of the soil. Then it's going to\", \"hit the root. It's going to stick to the\", 'root and then creep over the surface of', 'the root. And if you add too much water,', \"and let's be honest, everyone overwaters\", \"their house plants. I feel like you're\", 'looking directly into my soul when you', 'say that.', 'Like on behalf of all the other plants,', 'stop.', 'And you know what happens if you', \"overwater your plants? They're very\", 'unhappy. And so sticky water encases the', 'plant. So when you say sticky, this is', 'surface tension and capillary action.', 'Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Like', 'I say, physics is getting in the way of', 'a good idea. I just want to water my', \"plant and now I've got surface tension\", 'and capillarity which become the', 'dominant forces. So can you grow plants', 'without water then? If water is such a', 'pain in the butt, can', \"Yes, there's another word. Can you grow\", 'plants without using water? So, if there', 'is', 'one fundamental feature of biology and', 'it dominates how biology works on the', 'earth and it is one of the the guiding', 'principles of when we send probes out to', 'find life, liquid water is part and', 'parcel of the biology that we', \"understand. And we don't know how to do\", 'biology without water. So unfortunately,', \"okay, we're stuck with water. Sticky and\", \"creepy. Yeah. There's so many jokes I\", \"want to make. Oh, don't hold back. Go\", 'for it.', 'Really? I mean, if you just think about', 'getting off of Earth and going into a', 'low Earth orbit, going into space, we', 'are going to have to find lunar water.', \"But we're going to have to find other\", 'solutions off of this planet. Otherwise,', \"you're just dealing with a payer because\", \"you can't be bringing dirt, tons of dirt\", 'to grow things on any sort of industrial', 'scale. Not a chance. Yeah. I think at', \"the moment it's feasible because we're\", 'very very much in the sort of', 'exploratory world of like how are we', 'ever going to do this? What happens to', \"biology when it's in space? And we can\", 'deal with, you know, the plant growth', 'facilities that we have on the space', 'station are awesome, but they are 2 feet', \"by 2 feet by 2 feet and they're not\", 'designed to feed the crew. And feeding', 'the crew may not be the the eventual', 'goal. like, you know, self- sustaining,', 'completely self-sustaining with plants,', 'but getting to the fresh fruit and', 'vegetables thing where it supplements a', 'lot of the the freeze-dried food that', 'may be in our like at least in the near', 'future, but psychologically as well,', 'growing plants turns out to be quite a', 'big deal. Being in a spacecraft, if', \"you're an astronaut, astronauts,\", 'absolutely the most awesome job in the', \"world, but you're in a built\", \"environment. You're in a very small\", 'enclosed space for many many months and', \"you're with let's say five of your\", 'closest friends and at the end of that', 'journey you might only have zero close', \"friends left, right? It's just such a\", 'hard hard environment at a psychological', \"level and it's very built and you know\", 'on the space station you can see the', \"earth but you can't get back you know\", 'and and so growing plants at a', 'psychological level that may be the only', 'justification that you need in order to', 'take plants with you on a long journey', 'is that they are very very calming and', 'nurturing something and growing it and', 'then eating it I mean that that would be', 'a pretty awesome goal for an astronaut.', 'Okay, so naively coming to this as a', 'physicist, uh you just put a seed in the', 'soil and it grows, right? So in zero g,', 'how does it know what direction to send', 'a root versus what direction to send the', 'leaf? A B, when you get to the moon,', \"that's not soil. And earth soil is full\", 'of nutrients and microbes and and', \"there's a whole relationship. Yeah. That\", \"the plant has with what's going on\", 'already in the soil. Not so much on', \"Earth or Mars. So what's your plan to\", 'feed astronauts on the space? Not not', 'only on the space station, but on on', \"world. What' you say? On world. Off\", 'world. Off world. Yeah. Biology is', 'awesome. Biology is incredibly robust.', 'Plants grow. Okay. In space in that', 'microgravity world and the shoots grow', \"in the direction of the light. So that's\", 'an easy one. And you know we we build', 'growth chambers into space that are like', 'growth chambers on the earth with lights', \"at one end. We'll call that the top.\", \"Wait, wait, wait. If it's in the soil,\", 'how does it know which way the light is?', \"If it's buried in the Well, the roots\", 'have a random distribution. So as the', 'roots go through the soil, that', 'directionality is completely lost. How', 'are you sensing light if you are covered', 'in dirt? How deep do you plant?', \"You're planting, you're burying. Light\", 'penetrates soil quite deeply, especially', \"red light. So, there is there's a\", \"gradient. There's your answer. Okay. Um,\", \"there's my answer. Okay. So, okay. So,\", \"we're talking about Earth soil and I\", \"think having decided we're now Luna\", 'based or using regalith lunar regalith.', \"How are the challenges when you're\", 'saying, well, there are zero microbes or', \"there are lunar microbes and there's no\", 'what we would classically define as', \"dirt. There's just this rubble. So, how\", 'how how is that experiment coming along?', 'So, growing in lunar regalith is plants', 'is challenging at partly at a nutrient', \"level. So, you know, there's there's a\", 'lot of the nutrients the plants would', \"need, but it's locked up in chemical\", 'forms which are not immediately', 'accessible, right? So, you could imagine', 'you might chemically process that lunar', 'regalith or you might use microbes and', 'and you know seed some regalith with the', 'microbes that then turn over the rock', 'and then make it available to the', 'plants. One of the biggies which is a', \"it's a limit to a lot of plant growth on\", 'Earth is nitrogen. So biologically', 'available nitrogen form of like nitrates', \"or ammonia. Uh that's what plants want\", 'to take up and there is zero', 'biologically available nitrogen in', 'regalith on the moon. There is nitrogen', \"there. It's been deposited but it's just\", 'not in that nitrate ammonary sort of', 'chemical form that plants could take up.', 'Okay. So on Mars which is also has', 'equally hostile surface chemistry. We', 'learned from Mark Wattney in the movie', 'The Martian that you you just just slap', 'some poop in there and and put a little', 'seed in it. It took us how long to get', 'here?', 'I was on a countdown as soon as he', 'mentioned nitrogen. Got nitrogen. I was', 'like, \"The poop is coming. The poop is', 'coming.\" So you you want fertilizer. He', 'made poop potatoes. So can can you And', 'he was a botonist. He was an authentic', 'bot. Even though he was an actor playing', 'a botist, he was a botnist. So, how', 'authentic was that solution to his food', 'problem? If only that had been a', 'documentary, it would have been', \"awesome. But there's a lot of good stuff\", 'there in in like the science behind it.', 'Take human waste, you can compost it and', 'process it, and you can turn it into', 'fantastic nitrogen-rich fertilizer. That', \"that's all done by microbes, but you\", 'know, human waste has a lot of microbes', \"in it. You have to process it. You can't\", 'use raw human waste at many many levels.', 'One of them is that, you know, the', \"reason we don't use raw human waste is\", 'there a tremendous possibility of', 'getting parasites and things like that', \"in it. And you know, they're by\", \"definition they're going to be bad for\", \"humans. So that's one reason. And the\", \"other is that it's an incredibly\", 'concentrated form of all of those', 'bioavailable nutrients and you need to', 'process it. So imagine that there was', 'composted that would work but you know', 'composting is going to take some time.', 'The other aspect of it is I seem to', 'remember he shoveled Martian regalith', 'into the habitat and then just planted', 'in that and there are some issues with', 'Martian regalith which are more than', \"just it doesn't have all of the\", \"nutrients. It's um very salty which is\", 'generally bad for plants but it also is', 'very high in a group of chemical called', 'perchlorates and perchlorates are toxic.', \"They're toxic to people. Um so you can\", \"totally go down the poop road. Um it's\", 'not far-fetched. It requires some work.', 'Down the poop road is the name of my', \"next comedy special. Yeah, that's just\", \"that's a keeper. Look for it on Disney\", \"Plus. Yeah, that's a keeper. Right. So\", \"what you're saying is and I and I grant\", 'sort of whole passes to movies in this', \"way all the time. What you're saying is\", 'he meant well in this intent. So you', 'give it to him because you had to think', 'about fertilizer. You had to know that', 'the Martian soil was not was hostile to', 'plant life. And so all the rest of those', 'details you you give him a pass on that', 'because he he went there at all in the', 'story line. Is that is that fair? That', 'is absolutely fair. And also he gets a', 'lifetime pass because he made botney', 'cool. Yeah. And that that is a feat. He', 'said the attractiveness for astrobot is', 'very high.', \"No, it's an interesting point because I\", 'take for granted that any space movie is', 'going to have physicist and', \"astrophysicist in it. So we're we're in\", 'all the movies, but you got a botist', 'like where did he come? Who ordered', 'that? Well, see, look, I mean, the the', 'question now becomes, do we need in our', 'future generations to become space', 'farmers and therefore we would need', \"astrobotist? Then we're going to need\", \"these guys. Now, you work with NASA's\", 'gene lab, correct? With some your', 'experimentation.', 'Yep. So, are we are we looking at our', 'own experimentation with plants here on', 'Earth? So for things that are drought', 'resistant, fire resistant, you know,', 'work in extreme conditions, has that', 'empowered the sort of experimentation', \"you're thinking about bringing to space?\", 'Because we have a lot of variation of', 'conditions here on Earth, plants. Plus,', 'why is it that all it takes to grow a', 'perfectly healthy plant is a crack in', 'the pavement.', \"That's a fair point that if a plant\", 'could survive in New York, it can', 'survive on Mars. Crack anywhere.', 'thriving in the crack of the pavement.', \"I'm saying take that, transplant that\", 'into the space and then then you get', \"something good there. We're in the era\", 'of big data and so NASA has this what', 'gan lab is is basically a data', 'repository where a lot of data sets just', 'are being brought together from around', 'the world. a lot of things like uh we', 'have technology which will allow us to', 'ask in an organism which genes get', 'switched on and which genes get switched', 'off in space across every single gene', 'that that organism has. So one answer to', 'that question of how how are we sort of', 'navigating this world towards a space', \"crop is we're still in the discovery\", 'phase of trying to work out what happens', \"to biology in space. So, we're getting\", 'all of this sort of characterization', \"that's coming back and we're using that\", 'to go, well, what do we think happened', \"to these plants while they're in space?\", 'Did they feel like using the fuel? Did', 'they feel like they were um they were', 'under drought conditions? Did they feel', 'like the light was high or low? You', \"know, and we're getting that sort of of\", 'landscape. And then we can go to plants', 'that exist on Earth and go, well, do we', 'have plants that deal with that? And is', 'this a characteristic that we can sort', 'of take and then build into our', 'spacecraft world? And then the other', \"aspect of it is that it doesn't matter\", 'how great the plant is. If the goal is', \"for an astronaut to eat it, there's a\", 'food science component of it, they want', 'have to want to eat it. You know, being', 'in space is tough. Astronauts tend to', 'have suppressed appetites, you know, and', 'having something which is like just the', 'absolutely the freshest best thing that', 'they want to eat is another component of', 'that. And so we have to bring in all of', 'these these various aspects of what a', 'successful space crop is going to be.', 'Oh, do we know if like a space tomato', 'though tastes like a earth tomato?

Correct. In', 'this case so at an individual level', 'plants show a form of of sort of growth', 'and development that we call plastic.

Talk Neil de grass', 'Tyson here your personal astrophysicist', \"of course I'm here with Chuck KN Chuck\", \"baby hey what's happening all right very\", \"nice very good uh you've been been doing\", \"all right I you know I'm actually I've\", 'been doing very well yeah this has been', 'a great time the past few months have', \"been thank you for asking no no good I'm\", \"very I'm very happy right now we got to\", 'keep our comedians happy well because', \"that's that's that's an oxy right\", 'there happy', \"comedian that's kind of the job of\", 'everybody we got to make sure you you', \"can you you're ready for the gigs right\", \"so you know what we're going to talk\", 'about today mhm what simulating Mars oh', \"my goodness well we're supposedly get\", 'get your', \"ass you know we're supposedly going\", 'there at some point so we should', 'simulate it', \"we figure out what we're going to be in\", 'for figure that out I have no expertise', 'whatsoever in this okay so we found', 'Commander Kelly hon Kelly welcome to', 'Star', \"Talk hi it's nice to be here yeah so\", \"you're you're commander of what so I was\", 'the commander of the first of three', 'simulated Mars missions with NASA right', \"so even though you didn't fly through\", 'the vacuum of space they still got to', 'call you Commander because the whole', 'mission was simulated yes yes I know how', 'lucky is that I was going to say does', 'that make you a simulat', \"commander yes yes I'm I'm an analog\", 'Commander analog analog okay very you', \"have a PhD in biomed Sciences that's\", \"exactly the kind you know that's who you\", \"want that's yeah that's in a Mars\", \"habitat that's very markwat of you but\", \"they didn't leave her for dead on\", \"Mars and she still on Earth it's a good\", 'simulation', \"too so we're talking about NASA's chapia\", 'Mission did I pronounce that correctly', 'yes yes chapia this is reads like one of', 'those tortured acronyms but take me', 'through it so chapia and I I will uh', \"it's it's a crew um health and uh it's\", \"it's basically going to evaluate the\", 'health and performance of a crew in a', 'one-year Mars uh Mission so B the the', 'the idea behind it is to put people into', 'a simulation where you can actually test', 'how the isolation and resource', 'restriction including food communication', 'water all sorts of things that you any', 'kind of resource that you can imagine', \"that you would need on amar's mission is\", 'actually in limit limited amounts um and', 'you have three four people actually', 'basically pretending to be on Mars and', 'doing all the activities associated with', 'uh keeping a habitat functioning and', 'doing science while they are actually on', 'a mission now you know in other parts of', 'the military we call that enhanced', 'interrogation no no no you know what it', \"is it's a test to see if they'll kill\", \"each other right that's all it is that's\", \"that's a great reality show they have to\", 'yes that is a great reality show but', 'they have to leave their weapons outside', 'I think maybe so chapia I have here crew', 'health and performance', 'exploration analog wow okay yeah and it', 'sounds like something you would put in', \"yogurt like I'm so healthy I put so much\", 'Chapa in my', 'yogurt so so where did this take place', 'it took place in h a hanger on Johnson', 'Space Center in a 3D printed habitat wow', 'so this is in Johnson Space Center in', \"Houston in Houston Texas that's right\", 'yeah yeah so it was 3D printed to', 'simulate maybe what you would do on Mars', 'you have to print up anything you need', \"yeah you can't carry it there right you\", \"can't carry it and you need to use the\", 'materials that are possibly present so', 'obviously regolith which is those you', 'know a soil that is going to be on the', 'Martian surface is a potential substrate', 'that you could use to actually print', 'something um other options of course are', 'but just just to be clear regolith when', 'we think we we Loosely say Martian soils', 'but soil has a very strict meaning on', \"Earth which Mars does not have so what's\", 'the difference between soil and regolith', \"well there's going to be mineral content\", 'differences so Mars is actually made up', 'of the same minerals as the Earth but it', 'has different components different', \"proportions so you're going to have\", 'different proportions of minerals', \"present you're also going to have a lack\", 'of moisture because Mars is does have', 'some water in the ice caps and', 'potentially underground which is pretty', 'exciting but it does not actually have', 'water content easily available on the', 'surface the way our soil would have you', 'know water content so therefore it', \"doesn't support a biota in the soil\", \"itself correct okay so that's why Mark\", 'Watney had to get uh he made poop', \"potatoes right yeah he couldn't just\", \"grow it in the the soils because isn't\", \"isn't a lot of the soil iron what do you\", \"do with that well you can't do a lot\", 'with it other than actually build a', 'habitat so you can actually potentially', 'use it to uh create a habitat that might', 'actually be both uh protective in from', 'environments and also potentially', 'protective from radiation as well so', \"that's something construction material\", \"that's great yeah exactly yeah how long\", 'were you there we were there for 378', \"days damn oh that is that's intense whoa\", \"yeah now who do you hate most let's be\", \"honest cuz you know it's like day three\", \"and you're just like oh my God this\", \"dude's an\", \"aole so there's four of you who who are\", 'the other three you you can name them', 'yeah sure so we had flight engineer Ross', 'Brockwell who is a structural engineer', 'those we had yeah and we had our medical', 'officer uh Nathan', 'Jones an ER doc so so really versed in', 'emergency medicine and then we had our', 'Science office officer Ana salario who', 'is actually a microbiologist who works', 'for the Navy right now wow all right so', 'this this is and and and combined with', 'your background right but you guys can', 'make anything happen yeah sounds like', \"the nerdiest heist crew ever it's like a\", 'heist movie with with the nerdiest crew', 'ever which is awesome there was there', \"was significant levels of nerd I can't\", \"lie yeah no that's that nerds know how\", 'to hang out we love that so uh before we', 'get into some of the nitty-gritty of', \"this uh I'm big fan of the of The\", 'Twilight Zone Series going back to the', 'late 1950s actually the original the', 'original the original the original and', 'not the not the uh uh Jordan Peele', \"version well maybe I haven't seen it yet\", \"I can't comment yeah you don't like it\", \"okay okay fine I'm sorry so that if we\", 'remember was the dawn of the space age', 'right right and many of the episodes', 'were made before anyone had been yet', 'launched into space but we knew it was', 'coming and there multiple episodes of', 'astronauts that are just alone in space', \"and they're exploring the psychological\", 'damage that can bring from being away', \"from other humans right and it wasn't\", 'until I was older that I realized you', \"know there's long stretches of time I\", \"don't want to be around anybody oh yes\", \"and I'm a sociable person so clearly\", \"they're like Hermits out there where\", 'this would not be an issue at all right', \"and fathers and and NASA's always\", 'yapping at you anyway all right so so', 'this idea of isolation is it as', 'devastating as these psychological', 'dramas would have us think you know one', 'of the questions that comes up is is how', 'how isolating is it truly to be on a', 'mission like this um or how isolating', \"will it be that's what it's testing\", 'right how are people going to handle', \"this um and I will say that it's both\", 'incredibly isolating at times and also', 'an opportunity to get closer to people', 'and so amazingly I feel like actually', 'many of my relationships deepened during', 'this period um because there was less so', 'so first of all NASA does speak to us', 'all the time there was a significant', 'delay', 'they well well the good news is they', 'could only type because there was a time', 'delay of uh significant time delay', 'across the mission based on how far Mars', 'was from Earth during the whole mission', 'up to 22 minutes one way so at the', 'height of our time delay it took 22', 'minutes for a message to get to us and', '22 minutes for us to send an answer back', 'or vice versa this is the T delay of', 'radio waves moving through the vacuum of', 'space right right so there no witty', \"reparte with NASA and why use I'm asking\", 'you both why use radio why not use like', 'some kind of laser communication no it', \"all all light it doesn't make a\", 'difference all has the same speed same', 'speed has the same speed correct correct', 'okay so so they built that in even', \"though you're just sitting right there\", 'in Houston they built in the time delay', 'absolutely and data size also comes into', \"play there so it's not just actually\", \"sending something but how large you're\", 'sending so the larger the item so if', \"you're going to send an audio file or a\", \"video file or even a picture that's\", 'going to take longer than just a typed', 'message so you have all sorts of', 'limitations there that you have to sort', \"of take into account when you're sending\", 'a message so we had communication with', 'NASA which was delayed for the same', 'amount of time as our emails but our', 'emails would also take into account', 'generally size um so yes we did actually', 'have communication with we had a', 'schedule that NASA um you know set up', 'for us daily we followed that schedule', 'similar to astronauts on the ISS we', 'basically check marked you know our', 'things off the same way they did we', 'followed a red line um of sort of', 'timeline and had to do things in a', 'timely fashion but we also would have to', 'communicate back to them sometimes or if', \"we were troubleshooting we'd have to ask\", \"them for help and then we'd have to wait\", \"for we'd either have to troubleshoot it\", 'ourselves or wait for that 22 minutes to', 'hear back from them for what their', \"answer was but that's a great way to get\", 'yourself 22 minutes minutes uh if you', 'want they ask you a question and you', 'just write back please clarify and then', 'go have some', \"coffee just a delay yeah exactly I don't\", \"understand please repeat I didn't quite\", \"get that and then it's like all right\", \"guys you know now it's time for some\", 'Maxwell', 'out a badly behaved crew would', 'potentially do that but we would have', 'never done it', 'that to you know sort of follow our own', 'solution while for NASA to let us know', 'what to do um but but we did become', 'quite autonomous in our responses and', 'then in in terms of communicating with', 'your family as well there was that delay', 'and also like things like video were', 'very uh intensely sort of data heavy so', 'hard to do for more than a minute or two', 'you really relied on emails and audios', 'but but you did get to talk to people in', 'that in that way talk I guess in quotes', 'and so you know you you spent more time', 'than you normally did communicating with', 'people but you actually put a lot into', 'it and my friends family were amazing in', 'that they gave me this like richness of', \"communication that I've referenced a few\", 'times where they really Ste stepped up', \"to a form that we don't use anymore very\", 'often and communicated with me in this', 'way and supported me through the mission', 'and it was it was actually I I ended up', 'learning things about people that I', \"didn't know yet so now let me ask you\", 'this and uh this may seem a bit juvenile', \"but I just got to ask I'm not saying\", 'that it happened I just want to know', \"what NASA's policy is when it comes to\", 'uh you know a little like romance', 'happening between the uh crew members uh', 'are there any guidelines like you find', 'yourself having some warm feelings about', 'somebody on the crew what what happens', \"in something CU you're spending a year\", 'with these people what happens in that', \"case NASA probably didn't I can't speak\", 'for NASA I can tell you that they did', 'give us some um information about that', \"and and one thing for and and and I'm\", \"I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this\", 'but I will say that um pregnancy was an', 'out like you did not get pregnant on', 'this you were not supposed to get', 'pregnant on this Mission and so I would', 'imagine given that it was earth-based if', 'you did get pregnant they would have', 'removed you from the mission potentially', \"I'm hypothesizing on this based on\", 'information maybe that I was given um we', 'were also uh the majority of us were', 'partnered so that would create some', 'problems on Earth if you did get warm',

relationships all the', \"time uh so I'm I'm sure that that could\", 'happen at some point and we were lucky', 'enough not to deal with anything like', \"that uh however I I don't know if um you\",

they're going to\", 'let the mission go um unless certain', \"things do happen that they've outlined\", 'ahead of time so I would say luckily we', \"didn't have those issues but but it\", \"brings up something that I'm actually\", 'really interested in in future thoughts', 'around analoges and also real missions', 'which is is it better to send Partners', \"there's a huge issue with sending\", 'Partners in terms of crew Dynamic but in', \"terms of human happiness there's\", 'actually a reason to think about sending', 'families or or or you know units of', \"people because you you know if you're\", 'going on a three-year Mission a one-year', 'mission is actually relatively short', 'Mars is going to be longer and and so', 'thinking about how we can send couples', 'may actually be a viable way to keep', 'people happier although admittedly', \"that's going to have to be a crew that\", 'comes together beforehand and and', \"there's there's other inherent dangers\", \"in in crew Dynamic part that's part of\", 'the', \"research part of you're finding that out\", \"you're finding that out yeah yeah\", 'however I would love to see at least one', 'uh experiment where that happens where', 'you have couples because I just want to', 'see that type back to Mission Control', 'which is uh can we get a more', 'comfortable couch sent up here but', 'um 9 months typically is a Journey to', 'Mars you were not simulating the Ride To', 'Mars you were simulating your time on', 'Mars but getting back to the pregnancy', 'issue the there was a movie about this', 'really it was called I think the space', 'between us okay yeah there was a woman', 'who got pregnant the night before she', \"flew to Mars oh and then she's delivers\", \"on arrival to Mars because it's a N9\", 'month mission right and so but NASA had', 'to keep the whole thing so this was a', 'child born and no one knew about the', 'child and so the child grew up on Mars', 'in 40% gravity and there was a whole',

square', 'footage did you guys occupy oh 1700', \"square feet no and no what what I'm done\", \"sorry and you didn't kill each other\", 'four people and you did that was the', 'habitat that was the habitat we did have', 'outdoor area that we went out into and', 'when we mimicked Mars walks um that was', 'obviously in an outfit where we were you', 'know mimicking a space suit so we did', 'actually have a little I call it going', 'outside I loved going outside but but', 'our habitat which we were in sometimes', \"for weeks at a time we didn't go outside\", 'all the time so um yes 1,700 square feet', \"right so when they go out that's when\", 'they sneak to', \"McDonald's she didn't say where they\", \"went just oh simulating you're in\", \"Houston girl guys guys I'm going on\", 'another Mars walk how come you always', 'come back from the Mars walk with', \"ketchup on your suit what's up so so 1\", '1700 sare ft you could easily put four', 'people in that living in a Manhattan', 'apartment yeah but you get to exit the', 'apartment multiple times a day which is', 'why New York city streets are so', \"crowded because there's a bunch of\", 'people living in these tiny little Mars', \"Bas it's not an impossible area that I\", 'can imagine putting for people but when', 'you have the urge to go on a Mars walk', 'where in Houston do you go are you', 'walking down down like the street with a', 'Mars or they have a like a', 'campus where where this happens So', 'within rate attached to our habitat we', 'actually had an area that was covered um', 'over to and and made to look like Mars', 'so we actually exited the habitat but', 'stayed within a defined area and we used', 'two different mechanisms we used virtual', 'reality so we actually had goggles and a', 'treadmill that we got on and we were', 'able to go and do activities associated', 'with scientific activities and also', 'maintenance activities that you would', 'expect to do um so we actually went', 'outside but wait when you said goggles', 'you mean VR goggles VR VR goggles yeah', 'like a whole a whole VR rig like like', 'you know with the hand contr whole oh', 'gotcha gotta and the treadmill is to to', 'pretend like you were actually walking', 'great distances you cover ground cover', \"ground I mean at this point I've walked\", \"miles on Mars yeah oh that's super cool\", 'actually but it does kind of feel like a', 'little Truman Show it is yeah yeah what', 'was your what was your sky and your', 'horizon so in VR the the realism was', 'excellent like it was the the VR team', 'was amazing and they put together a', 'really beautiful package and set of', 'activities for us that we got to do um', 'the the non-vr was a little less realism', \"because obviously you're in a hanger in\", \"Houston that's pretending to be part of\", 'Mars you know in a little area but it', \"actually wasn't bad like it was really\", 'the activities we were given the builds', 'that we were given the different', 'activities that we had to do outside um', 'combined with the outfit that we wore', 'did really sort of give you the sense', 'again without the environmental issues', 'of Mars so we we were lacking that but', \"like you know so you can't you're not\", 'going to mimic the gra the difference in', 'gravity or the difference in an you', 'could they could they could put a joist', 'on all of you right to make you just a', 'little bit lighter yeah they could have', \"done that you're you're right and and we\", 'did have um aspects of like I think', 'again what we I always think about', 'analoges as what are they trying to ask', 'here they were trying to mimic the the', 'workload that would stress us out and or', 'or Tire us out or or be the thing that', 'actually made you physically or mentally', 'tired they were not actually you know um', 'trying out you know equipment for an', 'actual Mars mission so you know we were', 'we were addressing very specific things', 'and that was not in the scope so but', 'that would be really really cool can', 'imagine another such Mission analog', \"mission where it's it's just for the\", 'gravity part yeah and that would be', 'amazing right to really try that out and', 'see how that would feel but you would', 'have to rig both outside and inside it', 'would be you know resource wise it would', \"be quite a heavy lift for you'd be about\", \"on Mars you'd be about 60 pounds is that\", 'right yeah that sounds about right yeah', \"so so you you'd have a very different\", 'different experience I got to get to', 'Mars as quickly as I can my goodness', \"that's not how it works J you don't\", 'leave the fat behind now what does Mars', \"do for man boobs because that's where\", \"I'm really having the problem\", \"uh so um so of course you're in a hanger\", 'so you never exit The Hanger even when', 'you go out on your walks now I I figured', \"that out I mean we didn't see anyone we\", \"didn't hear the people outside of like\", \"even though I I mean it's it's the\", 'weirdest feeling right you enter this', 'habitat and you enter this space that', \"you're going to be living in for 378\", 'days but and you know that mission', 'control is in a wall just a few few', \"doors down from you and yet you don't\", \"see them for a year you don't speak to\", \"them directly for a year you don't hear\", \"them because they're being quiet like\", 'what a what a what an incredible labor', 'of love they did which is they they', 'spent a year working in a place where', 'they had to be bone quiet like just so', \"quiet so that they didn't actually\", 'interfere with the mission at all wow so', \"it's a really strange like I mean\", 'analoges are really funny that way', 'because you have to buy into it on both', 'sides right the ground has to be the', 'ground the the mission in in space or or', 'on a planet has to be the mission and so', \"it's actually a really it's a very\", 'surreal thing as a scientist I can tell', \"you that like it's it's a really\", 'interesting thing to see like all of us', 'drop into it and then like experience it', 'and everybody had different approaches', 'and different ways to deal with it but', 'we all did you know do our best to um to', 'to do the mission as if it was real so', 'that we were giving the best possible', \"data to NASA because that's the key\", 'right why else are you giving a year of', 'your life up at any point', 'psychologically do you begin to believe', 'the cosplay I was going to ask that that', 'you are involved in I mean', \"Mar and and and you don't want to\", 'actually exit because that could mess up', 'your brain do you actually go Daniel de', \"Lewis on us and just like you know I'm\", \"actually here I'm doing this you know I\", 'am build butcher like I can honestly say', 'I did not I I wish I could say I did um', 'I think it would have actually made it a', 'really interesting experience as well', \"but but I think you're always it's\", 'almost impossible to turn your brain off', \"and know that you're not on Earth\", \"there's just a num number of differences\", \"right like that you're not going to\", 'experience similar things so so you are', \"aware of it but you're\", \"also you're so determined to do the the\", \"mission in the way that it's set up that\", 'I think that you you buy into the', 'experience in a very deep way like the', 'fact that we were this unit this team', 'that was functioning together and that', 'we had to continue functioning together', 'to do our work properly and so forth and', 'and even to think about the work right', 'like doing science in this setting is', 'not the way I do science normally right', 'I do science and I actually produce', 'particular types of data um here we were', 'doing making data for the sake of', 'actually producing data personally so we', 'were actually making science um that for', \"want of a better word didn't matter it\", 'was creating data of a different sort', 'and it was it was kind of a layer that I', \"you know you're the DAT you had you are\", 'the DAT but really but really I am doing', 'the science is actually the data me', 'doing the science is the data and then', 'you know', 'yeah and and by the way that was also a', 'Twilight Zone episode where there is an', 'actor on a s okay who had such a', 'miserable home life but his acting role', 'he had a a joyous family and loving kids', 'and everything and he just flipped one', 'day and became the actor that he was', 'acting wow you know and they took down', 'the walls of the things what are you', \"doing that's my\", 'it was the Twilight Zone been up and', 'down these streets multiple times couple', 'other things the', 'the I seem to remember some studies', 'where they put people in a in a room', 'where they could live whatever', \"biorhythms was natural to them I don't\", \"know if that's the right term and when\", 'they did this they found that 24 hours', \"was not a natural unit of people's um\", 'what do you call circadium of their', 'rhythms that it was more like 25 and a', 'half hours oh really so they so when', 'they were left to their own their', 'schedule shifted against so it made you', 'wonder is our life and our 24-hour clock', 'forcing us away from our what is natural', 'so did you do Martian days or Earth days', \"oh that's Martian day is what Martian\", 'day a little the Martian yeah the', 'Martian day would be a little longer so', 'it would actually be perfect to that it', 'would would actually speak to that study', 'we did not and um I can hypothesize a', 'few reasons for that number one um when', 'we do activities on our schedule right', 'some of them can be autonomous like', 'cleaning the hab or doing maintenance on', 'the hab or or whatever um or our', 'personal time obviously but there are', 'other activities where we need an expert', \"on the ground that's actually monitoring\", \"Us in case there's troubleshooting to be\", 'had right so our time and and similar to', \"anyone that's going to go to space or do\", 'these trips is also going to be', 'dependent on the crew in Houston or', \"whatever space station who's actually\", 'monitoring them so we stayed to the the', \"Earth clock no no I'm not buying that no\", 'no because when we send actual missions', 'to Mars the folks at JPL right have Mar', 'two clocks on their wrist they Maring', 'time and Earth time yeah yeah how many', 'souls are there at so for Sun Sunday and', \"so they're forced to match the circadian\", 'rhythms of The Rovers', 'so so so make make Houston go on your', \"schedule don't don't well I would say\", 'from the experience that I think that', 'and and this is just my experience um', \"not NASA's opinion of this but but I\", 'think having had this experience that', 'the crews that go to Mars are going to', 'be far more autonomous than what NASA is', 'used to like the the time delay means', \"you can't wait 45 minutes for an answer\", 'most of the time you have to go forward', 'with your your troubleshooting solution', \"unless it's something that can be put\", 'off and changed to a later time in the', \"day after you've heard from them so to\", 'be honest I think that the the the', 'environment and also the the delay and', 'the length of time that people are going', \"to be there I have a feeling it's going\", 'to be a very different style Mission', \"even than what we're doing right now so\", \"even though I think that they're they're\", 'getting close to trying to actually', 'answer questions about safety and health', 'with analoges like this by the time we', 'go to Mars and actually have people', \"living there I think they're going to\", 'have like ironed out some of these', 'things and I have a feeling that', \"people's biology is going to actually\", 'you know adapt and and re Supreme so in', 'the end I have a feeling that will', 'probably be the case um but for our', 'analog we did stick to Earth time and so', 'yeah see I would just if you you gonna', 'put me away for a year you GNA follow my', \"schedule that's yeah I I am the one\", \"that's up there I would get beligerant\", 'about it exactly yeah right so let me', 'ask you when you said cleaning the hab', 'like how do you guys divvy up those', 'duties is it a group thing where you all', 'get together like okay so and where do', 'you put the dust that gets swept in the', 'corners right yeah and what do you do if', \"somebody's like kind of a slob just like\", 'Jim how many times you going to leave', 'your space drawers in the middle of the', \"dog on H what's up man seriously we're\", 'all a unit here space', 'draws that a different kind of draw', \"know so you had to you're\", 'self-sufficient right so food yeah', 'washing clothes everything so we had', 'everything so there was um a there was a', 'free Supply in certain locations so we', 'could get things delivered to us from', 'those presup areas we had Depots that', 'were potentially so there were times', 'where we retrieved things um from those', \"re resupply areas that's a simulation of\", 'a what a supply ship would deposit', 'exactly uncrewed Supply ship right in a', 'drop good exactly yes um but there were', 'um instances and there were things where', 'we just had everything we were going to', 'have in the hab from the very start and', 'so right from the get-go for cleaning', 'supplies we we inventoried them and we', 'actually we were tremendous in I I will', 'be braggy about that a little bit and', 'say like our crew had so much stuff left', 'over because we really were like very um', 'resource we we were like so tight on the', 'resourcing that we actually had', 'abundance at the end in some of our', 'items because we just were really strict', 'and we reused things like crazy we were', \"like recyclers like you wouldn't believe\", 'so that was kind of awesome but for the', 'cleaning and and all the different', 'activities some of them were assigned so', 'sometimes it would we would go to our', 'schedule and it would be like you know', 'commander and and Fen the flight', 'engineer are out today on Eva so those', 'would be dictated by our schedule and by', 'NASA but other things we would NASA will', 'never call that space walking they have', 'to say extra vehicular activity uh okay', 'that you know I feel like just slapping', 'them okay okay so your fan is out on an', 'Eva go on okay yes so but other', 'activities like like cleaning so forth', 'we would come together as a crew at the', 'beginning of the week and look at the', 'activities that we sort of were either', 'assigned for or thought needed to happen', 'and then we would divvy them up and so', 'we had a a pretty fair system where we', 'kind of kept track of who did what the', 'last time and and cycled it around so', \"people didn't get bored but also luckily\", \"I didn't see anybody in their space GIS\", 'so yay

uh\", 'collaborative at getting together before', 'the mission um we had a limited amount', 'of data that we were each allowed to', 'bring in and a limited amount of', 'personal items so there was a

to come from somewhere right', 'and so did you have solar panels out', 'front the way you have would might have', 'on Mars and were they only operating 12', 'hours a day and at Mars the sun is like', 'you know half as Intense or something', \"it's farther back farther back so how\", 'what was your energy budget cuz the buck', 'stops at', \"right exactly I don't know how much I\", 'can answer about

clean those panels so yeah so that', \"that's a very natural thing you'd have\", 'to do on Mars yeah okay go on yes and', 'and and similarly in terms of uh', 'resourcing and and how that was how that', 'functioned that was part of the', \"experimental design and I don't know if\", 'I can actually disclose it but in each', 'case we were given limitations for', 'certain things that the mission was', 'interested in and so that was something', 'that they measured throughout the', 'mission and and that will probably be', 'the some of the items that we actually', 'are unblinded to when we

when you haven't had fresh\", 'vegetables for six months then it feels', 'like a crop I gotta because man you are', 'happy to eat those so I would say um yes', 'we did we did have a very small scale uh', 'grow area and we were able to supplement', 'with that um but I think the idea being', 'that in any Mission you hope to always', 'supplement for people with fresh', 'vegetables and and and fruits and so', 'forth because you could not have lived', 'off of that you could not have lived off', 'of that no and and if it f for any', 'reason right if if you ever had like a a', 'virus come through or fungus or', 'something like that come through if', 'anything a bacteria anything that took', 'your plants down and you were relying on', 'them you would be hosed right so any any', 'mission that goes to Mars or any place', 'Interstellar right a blight hits the', \"crops yeah yeah so obviously you're\", \"always going to have to and NASA that's\", 'I think one of the reasons that NASA', 'loves analoges is that you get ready for', 'every event like eventual problem right', 'lets you test out and and practice in a', \"safer space where you're not going to\", \"hurt people what's going to happen so\", 'that when they actually get there and I', 'think that Chris hafeld has said this', 'really nicely that like analoges just', 'really they make your muscle stronger in', 'these areas and then you actually know', \"what to do when you're there right and\", \"that's that's not for the people that\", \"are pretending to be on Mars it's for\", \"NASA who's actually you know preparing\", \"that way too so they're getting all this\", 'data on how to keep us healthy but', \"they're also actually testing how to\", 'keep teams happy and how to grow food', 'and and do that safely and so forth so', \"there's really cool aspects to it even\", \"though there's aspects that are like you\", \"know as you say it's a tradeoff and and\", 'and you do have to think about those', 'resources so I think I always want to', 'always ask people who ask me that', 'question like where do you think the', 'best money is for an analog uh Mission', 'and what what is like the best bang for', 'our buck how can we actually send people', 'to these places as safely as possible to', \"keep the public happy because we don't\", 'want to hurt people but we actually have', 'to take risk to to get to you know', \"places like Mars oh it's it's I think\", \"it's a a tremendous exercise in Risk\", \"Management I mean it's so so worth it\", \"and NASA's been very good about that\", 'ever since its found

we even had him play his guitar as', 'he did in space and say as I said leave', 'your guitar at', \"home I'm not even GNA lie\", 'so so Kelly we gota we gota call it', 'quits there uh this this been a delight', 'to have you on here and when you get all', \"when all three missions are done you're\", 'not going to repeat right no although I', 'would love to do like a different form', \"like I'd like

said\", \"so those cancel we're good however we\", \"now have an electron that's a kind of\", \"particle that we didn't start with we\", 'got to undo the fact that we now have an', 'electron oh cuz

asymmetry the cause for the', 'Big Bang we just talked about it but', 'could that I mean are you going to make', 'a big bang man in your in your yeah yeah', 'what are you hiding from', \"us yeah

were duly', 'informed that this whole study of the', 'melium networks for mushrooms and', 'mushrooms in general fungus is micology', 'yes which I think is a pretty cool a', 'wonderful area study I recently heard a', 'scientist describe the possibility that', 'the reason that we mammals were able to', 'evolve After The Dinosaurs had their', 'terrible Extinction right', 'is because we had a

the most is Mr Spock because I', 'loved how logical he was and I thought', 'it would be so great to live your life', 'without emotion and never be affected by', 'things just be able to assess them

going to find is\", 'convergent so life on EUR Ropo or', 'Enceladus uh um evolve to use DNA also', 'is it inevitable right or is there some', 'other way to get that biochemistry done', \"now the best argument I've heard for DNA\", 'although it took me part of the way', \"there but I'm still skeptical because of\", 'the complexity of a DNA', 'molecule a geologist said look when we', 'go to other planets the geology is', 'familiar MH right a rock crystal of', 'these atoms crystallizes the same way of', 'given the right temperatures and', 'pressures here as in there right and so', 'if the geology repeats itself no matter', \"what planet we're\", 'on maybe biology will repeat itself', 'exactly and I thought', 'okay I I I threw a bone to that and I', 'said all right let me let me hang with', 'that for a bit but speaking of Bones I', 'got a bone to pick with you you you', 'lumped Titan in with Enceladus and', 'Europa and Europa how dare you go on go', \"on WE You're motivated by the search for\", \"life that's right life on Earth\", 'everywhere has uh needs uses liquid', \"water yep there's no liquid water on\", 'Titan well to be clear there is we do', 'think that beneath the ice shell of', 'Titan there is an ocean trapped beneath', \"that thick ice shell but I think you're\", 'referring to the fact that on the', 'surface we got these liquid methane and', 'liquid if you have liquid methane you', \"don't have liquid water that's right\", 'just to be clear about that okay uh but', \"it's not just a given that every moon is\", 'going to have a heated interior from', \"title forces now I didn't do my homework\", 'on Titan before this interview but is it', 'subject to the same title stressing of', 'its physical body as Europa and as', \"Enceladus it's a bit of a more\", 'complicated story specifically at Saturn', 'and and this is the story is complic', 'Moon of Saturn right so Titan and', 'Enceladus and the moons of Saturn um', 'when it comes to the tides and how much', 'tidal energy they have now and have had', \"in the past it's a bit complicated\", 'because the various moons go through', 'resonances right kids on a swing set uh', 'kind of pumping each other up to to', 'swing in harmony or out of phase right', 'um in the Jovian system with Jupiter', 'system yeah the Jupiter system with IO', 'Europa and', 'ganam those three moons are right now in', 'a beautiful resonance we call the Lass', 'resonance so for every two times IO goes', 'around Europa I goes around Jupiter', 'Europa goes around Jupiter once for', 'every two times Europa goes around', 'Jupiter uh ganam goes around Jupiter', 'once I did not know they were in', \"resonance yeah and so that's what keeps\", 'their orbits slly the system evolves to', 'that because the the dynamical forces', 'favor it exactly so gradually the orbits', 'widen out and and then Iowa starts', 'tugging on Europa and Europa on gamed', 'perhaps someday Kalisto will be part of', \"the party but um right now it's not so\", 'that would complete the the big four uh', 'IO Europa gisto the four that Galileo', 'discovered right yeah the call them', 'Galilean moons in fact he called them', 'Stars I think the medician Stars he was', 'no idiot he knew where the paycheck was', 'coming', 'from because they were just points of', 'life that moved around Jupiter and why', \"think it's a moon if it's just a DOT of\", 'light it look like a star so so he', 'started off really well with like naming', 'the Stars the the stars of Michi the', 'Michi family was all happy and he was', 'like oh no these things go around', \"Jupiter next thing you know he's under\", 'house', \"arrest hey Star Talk fans I don't know\", 'if you know this but the audio version', 'of the podcast actually posts a week in', 'advance of the video version and you can', 'get that and Spotify and apple podcast', 'and most other podcast Outlets that are', 'out there multiple ways to ingest all', 'that is Cosmic on Star Talk what then', \"why not call IO an ocean world let's\", 'zoom out and um and think about kind of', 'a gold elock scenario right in the early', 'days of astronomy and planetary science', 'our conceptual conceptualization for', 'habitability was kind of framed around', 'this goldilock scenario Venus Earth and', 'Mars Venus is too hot Mars is too C', \"Earth is just right and that's all\", 'mediated by the the energy that the', 'planets receive from the Sun from their', 'Central Star not not just that the', 'energy that reaches the surface because', 'you can reflect away some energy and', \"that doesn't participate exactly in the\", 'energy equation yeah and so the the', 'thinking back then and still today is', 'that in order to have an earthlike', 'habitable planet you have to have you', 'have to be at that right sun star planet', 'distance so as to maintain and sustain', 'liquid water on the surface of Your', 'World whereas what these ocean worlds of', 'the outer solar system are teaching us', \"is that there's a new Goldilocks in town\", \"it's a Goldilocks where the energy for\", 'maintaining and sustaining liquid water', 'comes not through your parent star but', 'rather through the tug and pole and and', 'uh mechanical deformation and friction', 'and internal heating of tides of getting', 'stretched by Jupiter which is some 318', 'times as massive as the Earth M and so', 'back to your question about IO in this', 'analogy with a new Goldilocks IO is kind', 'of like Venus billions of years ago IO', 'may have had water but IO is the most', 'volcanically active body in the solar', 'system and it has since lost any water', 'that it perhaps had in the early days oh', 'you misunderstood my point go go on you', \"misunderstood no I didn't make myself\", 'clear your book is titled alien ocean', \"you're talking about ocean worlds you\", \"didn't you didn't specify water ocean so\", 'you want to you want to qualify a magma', 'magma ocean on aisle I told you the it', 'the most volcanically active object', 'known you find life forms in a magma', \"ocean that's uh that's I don't know but\", \"fair enough fair enough but you're right\", \"if it's hot enough to melt rock yeah\", \"probably there's no life hanging out\", 'doing a backstroke yeah', \"but you're you are correct in that there\", 'have been some nice papers on a magma', 'ocean in iio because that title energy', 'dissipation is so extreme okay from', \"avability standpoint it's got a game\", 'over okay uh but also I wanted to think', 'very freely because you guys make me do', 'this if we go to Titan where it has', 'enough atmospheric pressure to sustain a', 'liquid state of of methane yeah cuz as', 'without pressure then you lose your', 'liquid the range of temperatures where', 'you can keep a liquid right so so maybe', 'life does not require liquid water maybe', 'it just requires a liquid can you', 'imagine a life form where it is liquid', 'methane coursing through its veins or', 'whatever circulatory system it has yeah', 'so I really hope that kind of weird life', 'exists on Titan the challenge is I', 'actually have a bit of a hard time', 'formulating and hypothesis', 'that it could exist so for example', 'Europa and Enceladus we can say why', 'should nature care what you have a hard', 'time figuring', 'out are you the metric of what exists in', \"the universe you're 100% I know you\", 'wrote a book on it and everything I get', 'that but still right but when we do', 'experiments obviously with the', 'scientific method you formulate and', 'hypothesis yes and so I can formulate', 'and a hypothesis that uh life on Earth', 'is based on liquid water a suite of', 'elements and some energy to power life I', 'can then look at Worlds like Mars and', 'Europa and celus and say check check', \"check now there's a a fourth element\", 'there of time and stability that we can', \"come back to and there's some\", 'differentiation but Mars Europa and', 'celus I think we can check the box on on', 'liquid water and the other uh keystones', 'for life with the liquid methane uh on', \"on Titan um it's hard for me to say like\", 'based on what I know of life on Earth or', 'even oil fields on Earth that uh that a', 'hydrocarbon liquid could give rise to', \"life and and here's a the sort of key\", 'chemical difference liquid water is a', 'polar solvent right so uh in liquid', 'water we can dissolve other polar Mo', 'compounds the shape of the molecule', 'right gives a little plus minus uh yeah', \"it's got hydrogen and an oxygen and two\", \"hydrogen's coming off at an angle there\", 'yeah yeah and so we get the the', 'electrons get sort of preferentially uh', 'positioned such that you end up with a', 'plus and a minus with a water so just', 'correct my chemistry if I get it right', 'so if the two oxygens were sticking', 'straight out on either side then the', 'molecule itself would have no polarity', 'in that sense correct that is there', 'would be no difference between one', 'orientation and another and and water', 'would lose all of its really cool', 'properties that we cherish well positive', 'and negative actually comes a little', 'more from the from the hydrogen uh and', 'oxygen differentiation right well so', \"it's not the angle that they're coming\", 'down the angle plays a little bit but', 'the fill in in my chemistry yeah if you', 'split it down the middle like the the', 'oxygen is on one side of the V and the', 'hydrogen on the other yeah and so if you', 'flattened it out um you would definitely', 'affect the charge distribution you know', \"and it would just be it wouldn't be as\", 'effective at things we care about yeah', 'yeah and certainly you know coming uh', \"when it comes to Ice uh you wouldn't get\", 'that beautiful hexagon uh that is in', 'part uh due to the the the the vshape of', \"water I think it's like 109 degrees and\", 'then 107 depending on liquid and solid', 'form but liquid water great at', 'dissolving other polar compounds liquid', 'universal solvent we call universal', 'solvent for life on Earth right but you', \"go to Titan and now you've got this this\", 'these cold by our standards uh liquid', 'methane lakes and seas and liquid', 'methane is', \"nonpolar and so you're talking about\", 'life arising and and thriving in a', 'nonpolar solvent and that just makes me', \"scratch my head it's like could that\", 'work I sure hope it does I sure hope', \"Mother Nature is is I'm just saying if\", 'you go back aund and whatever years and', 'when Evolution was first a thing that', 'people discussed the and in fact Darwin', 'himself might have called for this what', \"we need is a 72° tide pool so it's just\", 'right for life to form and then the more', \"we looked it was like no you don't need\", 'that you can do it this way in fact you', \"don't even need sunlight I I'm old\", \"enough I'm an old man here my textbook\", 'said life requires sunlight M all right', \"that's before we had the undersea vents\", 'Thal vents which got a geochemical', 'energy thermal energy down there so and', 'now even in modern astrophysics a', 'planetary uh astronomy', 'the goldilock zone is insufficient to', 'get it all all the the places where', \"you'd have liquid water so this is an\", 'exercise in broadening any definition we', \"previously laid down for what we'd\", \"expect of Life yeah and I think there's\", 'one thing I be curious to hear your', 'thoughts on this life is just a biology', 'is a layer on top of geology okay and', 'and as such what life does is uh um wait', 'wait just just to be clear we would', 'later learn even that some significant', \"fraction of Earth's biomass lives\", 'underground right as a participant in', \"the geology that's there yeah so it's\", 'not just life on Earth and then hand', \"over to the geologist there's this\", \"there's this Zone where the two have to\", 'make nice in the Coffee Lounge right', \"okay

yeah and the', 'Galileo images so think about how', 'extraordinary the the images from G the', 'spacecraft okay he', 'was he did have a telescope and he did', 'look at', \"Jupiter to make sure we're on the right\", 'yeah Galo did not have half a meter per', 'pixel', 'resolution so Galileo the astronomer', 'point of light Galileo the spacecraft we', 'get uh beautiful pictures at you know',

that's not even\", \"that's nothing that's nothing in the\", 'history of our species yeah just say you', \"know one day we're going to go there\", 'yeah one of your', 'medician', \"y so you're going to a close view of the\", \"surface ice but you're not looking at\", \"the water below and that's what you\", 'really care about right and so what', 'Clipper has on board are cameras to give', 'us pictures of the surface spectrometers', 'to tell us about the surface', 'composition and by looking at the', 'surface ice we know from Galileo', 'spacecraft from uh telescopes that and', 'Hubble helps out Hubble yeah and uh that', 'the ice of Europa serves as a window', 'into the ocean below so using the', 'spectrometers and looking at the ice we', 'will get a bit of a fingerprint of the', \"ocean

even\", 'be a word up to just my opinion here', 'subsumption yeah is a term uh coined by', 'some colleagues of mine just oh so all', 'right you all just made up the word as', \"we do because I know there's subduction\", 'as when a a continental plate goes under', \"that's right and then there's yeah and\", 'so sub some words here is kind of', 'thinking about uh how that might occur', 'on an icy

\"debatable but so with Clipper we've got\", 'these um uh cameras and spectrometers', 'and then mass', 'spectrometers that will allow us to', 'taste any plume material coming out of', 'Europa well we can we can taste any', 'organic compounds carbon compounds so', 'taste you mean almost literally taste', 'because if you have the molecules and', 'you have something to detect the', \"molecule you

'people we can get amazing things we got', 'some people are good folks not just the', 'astronomers but of course the engineers', 'that actually make it happen shout out', 'to the engineer here okay

\"speak that's like 300 miles across all\", \"right it's still a nice object but it's\", \"not like it's not like Europa right and\", 'uh so what are the chances of you seeing', 'sort of macroscopic

my', \"lab and that's the fun like lab and\", \"spacecraft I know it's great it's great\", 'and they go hand in hand yeah and so we', \"can make predictions and uh and it's a\", 'lot of fun but so of

What can you tell us about', 'it? All right. Not that long ago, we did', 'a show on synthetic biological', 'intelligence or if you prefer organoid', 'intelligence. Organoid. Yes, I remember', 'right now. And those are if I remember', 'like 3D cultures to build brain-like', 'structures for bio computing, right? So', \"that's what that was being used for for\", 'our future overlords.', 'All right. So this was putting biology', 'onto technology. This is something', \"different. However, it's based around\", 'the organo intellig. But this now', 'becomes organoids assembling together.', 'Oh, now that then selforganizing', 'organizing organoid. So, our guest', 'today. All right. Well, we just Okay,', \"we're getting into it, baby. And what\", 'could go wrong?', \"Let's not do that question just yet.\", \"I'll save that for the end. Okay, go. So\", 'our guest today had the great idea of', 'trying to get these organoids to work', 'together and coined the phrase', 'assemblid. So assembloids is down to our', 'guest work. Now these assemblids can', 'help us uncover the biological mysteries', 'of our own minds. Mhm. So are we just', 'clumps of cells in the big petri dish we', 'can call life? Yes. I think sometimes', 'speak for yourself. Sometimes it can', \"feel like that. So um let's find our\", 'guest. You say in the petri dish of', 'life. Yes. That was beautiful. Was', \"You're welcome. I'm just reading it. And\", 'um', \"so let's let's see what mysteries have\", 'been sold. What mysteries are still out', 'there and our guest now. So uh drop in', 'on our guest. Yes, please. So we have', 'Sergio Pasca. Sergio, welcome to Star', \"Talk. So it's great to be here. Thank\", 'you so much for having me. Yeah. So', \"you're a neuroscientist on Star Talk\", 'special edition. We love neuroscientists', \"because that there's a serious future\", 'opening up right before our eyes. Yes,', 'it is in plain in plain sight. A fresh', 'frontier. Fresh frontier. Uh a stem cell', 'biologist. Stem cells have been pretty', 'much in the news on and off the past', 'couple of decades. A professor of', 'psychiatry and behavioral sciences at uh', 'Stanford. When I think about this,', 'however, I think of a psychiatrist or', \"behavioral scientist. They're just\", 'putting someone in a couch or observing', 'their behavior. This sounds way more', \"invasive than what it is you're doing.\", 'This sounds very puppeteerish.', 'Exactly. And you also been teding.', \"That's good. So, we can dig you up in\", 'the TED archives. Correct. Yeah.', 'Excellent. And and here in 2023, you', 'made a knight of the Order of Merit of', \"Romania. Oo. All right. So let's get\", 'back to basics here and put us all on', 'the same page with what an organoid is.', 'So an organoid is a clump of cells that', 'is cultured in a dish in a', 'three-dimensional structure and the name', 'actually organoid which is organike is', 'supposed to suggest that it resembles an', \"organ. So it's similar in some function.\", \"Of course, it's not a replica of an\", 'organ, but is supposed to model features', 'of an organ.', 'A scaffold of an organ. Well, I guess', 'like parts of an organ or like parts of', 'the function of an organ. So, for', \"instance, for the brain, it's not really\", \"a brain in miniature. It's not the\", 'entire organ in miniature, but it would', 'be like parts or aspects of the brain uh', 'that are being modeled. And by the way,', 'asteroids, they show up as stars on a on', \"a in a photo because they're so tiny,\", \"right? But they're not stars. So that\", \"they're asteroids. Little star. Exactly.\", \"So it's organike, I guess. Let's say you\", 'like starlike. Mhm. Oh, wait. Oh, so', 'those are organoids. Yes. All right. And', 'so now, so now you organize them in some', 'way or do they self-organize? You give', 'them instructions that they follow.', 'Well, I guess all of this work to be', 'honest like started with the ability to', 'actually even grow stem cells in a dish.', 'If you were to like step back and think', 'like how this all came together, you', 'know, stem cells as you know generally', 'are derived, you know, from an embryo,', 'right? Uh and that has been certainly', 'like very difficult uh to do studies.', 'Then about it was certainly politically', 'fraught with issues related to the', 'ethics of using human human embryos and', 'and that was a big issue until you guys', 'figured out or your people figured out', 'how to create stem cells without regular', 'cells out of regular cells. So this is', 'so that happened 20 years ago almost 20', 'years ago 19 years ago uh when a', 'Japanese scientist Shina Yamanaka made', 'this like breakthrough discovery where', 'he actually showed that you could', 'actually turn any cell that we have in', 'our body that is already differentiated', 'so like back in time to look like those', 'embryionic stem cells and so almost like', 'a you know sort of like cellular alchemy', 'so to speak right because it was like we', \"always thought that it's a one-way treat\", 'uh development is a one-way street. You', \"never sort like go back. Just so we're\", \"on the same page, stem cells, while it's\", 'always in the news, just as a reminder', 'to the non-biologist, it is a kind of', 'cell that you under the right conditions', 'can turn into any other cell of the', 'human body. Is that correct? Exactly.', 'Yeah. Nerve cells, muscle cells. Yeah.', \"And and that's why they're prevalent in\", 'the embryo because the embryo is', 'manufacturing the the all the cells,', 'right? Okay. Got stem cells have have', 'two properties. They can turn into any', 'other cells and they can renew', 'themselves. So they can stay as stem', 'cells for a very long time. And of', 'course there are multiple levels of stem', 'cells. The first ones are the ones that', 'are the most powerful. They can turn to', 'everything. And then as you progress in', 'development, they become more and more', 'restricted in what they can do. But the', 'ones that are real in the beginning uh', 'are you know the ones that you would', 'like to have so that you can ultimately', 'guide them to become different other', 'cells and tissues in in the body. Wait,', 'so you put them in a time machine? Is', \"that that box that's sitting behind you?\", 'You say that but how how is that', 'possible? How how are you able to take a', \"brain cell that you've cultured and dial\", 'it back to a stem cell and then bring it', 'into whichever area you need to bring it', 'to. So it was is really a brilliant idea', 'uh that build on work that was done', 'before and uh essentially the experiment', 'was like very simply done. He just', 'looked at the main genes that are', 'expressed in the stem cells and then he', \"said let's see which ones are really\", 'important. So he took them and he put', 'them in a actually in the skin cell.', 'Took a skin cell and starting putting', 'various combinations of those genes that', 'are very strongly present in those stem', 'cells. And through this', 'combinatorial you know experiment he', 'found out four that if you put at the', 'same time you know pretty much you know', 'confuse the cell so to speak and the', \"cell becomes reprogrammed. That's why we\", 'call it cell reprogramming because the', 'cell is really reprogrammed to that', 'state and it turns out that they have', 'all the properties of those embryionic', 'stem cells but you can make them from', 'anybody in a non-invasive way and of', 'course you can store them you can ship', 'them to others and so that was really a', 'breakthrough for the field because that', 'opened up the possibility for the first', 'time that you could get stem cells from', 'anybody from any patient and then start', 'to study it. uh in addition I was', 'finishing my clinical training around', 'that time and really to a large extent', 'like dropped everything because my uh', \"expertise I'm a physician by training my\", 'expertise is actually autism spectrum', 'disorders and neurodedevelopmental', 'conditions and I was like incredibly', 'frustrated by the lack of models to', 'study this disease we you know there are', 'animal models but you know what is an', 'animal model of autism right I mean that', 'has been so like a a challenging aspect', \"we can't really access the human brain\", 'right I mean that is sort of like the,', 'you know, this curse, this unbearable', 'inaccessibility of the human brain. I', \"mean, it's behind the skull and unlike\", \"any other organ, you can't just like go\", 'there, get a biopsy and study it. So, we', 'were sort of like blocked, so to speak,', \"locked into this state where we couldn't\", 'really make progress. And uh yeah, so', 'about, you know, 16 17 years ago, I I', 'came to Stanford meme by the like', 'potential of this uh stem cells that we', 'can make, which we called induced plur', 'potent stem cells.', 'and then started thinking could we', 'actually turn them into neurons from', 'patients and then study whatever defects', 'are characteristic of that disease but', \"outside of the human body and that's\", 'really what enabled uh you know all of', 'this and initially so that blew open the', 'whole field at that point well exactly', 'it open the whole field and you know in', 'the beginning just to make it clear it', 'was you know I mean I got all the grants', 'and all the fellowships rejected all the', 'time as this being absolutely insane you', 'know like how can you actually like make', 'neurons in a dish and then even expect', 'to find something from a disease that is', 'so mysterious, right? Think about I mean', 'autism is a complex disease of social', 'behavior. What are you going to see', 'actually in a dish?', \"So I mean we'll get back probably to\", 'this conversation but it was actually', 'key for us to focus on a disease where', 'we actually like knew what to expect', 'sort of like to calibrate and that sort', 'of like started that uh you know this', 'entire journey and in the beginning most', 'of these experiments were very simple', 'you know you would take the stem cells', 'from patients uh that we derive in a', 'dish and then kind like spike in various', 'molecules in a dish uh so like guide', 'them to try to become neurons and those', 'differentiation experiments were like uh', 'easy but then About 10 years ago, it', \"became clear that we're going to need\", 'more of the three-dimensional aspect of', 'development to really capture even more', 'complex features of the brain. And', \"that's how some of these 3D cultures\", 'which are now known as organoids appear', 'first. So, if the neurons are', 'self-organizing, a how do they know that', \"they're self-organizing? And how do they\", 'know where to go and be organized?', \"That's a very good question. And you\", 'know I mean self-organization is is a', 'remarkable force of nature and biology', 'right then and very often when we do', 'this experiments in a dish to be honest', 'for for very long time I was so like', 'thinking like an engineer in the sense', 'that oh if you want to build something', \"in a dish let's say a circuit you know\", 'you better so like know the blueprint', 'you better know like the instructions', 'and provide them at the right time and', \"so you don't start building a new house\", 'until you really have a very clear plan', 'and the tools but what we realize with', 'time is that in Biology actually you', 'know cells come with the instructions', 'you know so once you make a specific', 'cell actually comes with the instruction', \"and then by connecting let's say to\", 'another cell it reveals another set of', 'instructions right and another one and', \"another one and that's why we call this\", 'process self-organization so which', 'really is the formation of order', 'structured from you know relatively', 'homogeneous elements which which by the', 'way like talking of physics and', 'chemistry this was known from the 19th', 'century I mean There are classic', 'experiments that show you know that', 'molecules organize quite beautifully.', 'You know the riot Bernard convection I', 'guess is the classic example but biology', 'just brings it to the next level and now', 'organizes cells pretty much on their', \"own. So what you're doing is you're\", 'bringing these together in this culture', 'this 3D culture where the message and', 'directions are already resonant inside', 'of the cell. So when you put them', 'together or group them, they basically', 'do what they were going to do anyway.', 'Exactly. Okay. With with uh with one', 'detail, which is we have to make the', \"parts, right? If you don't have the\", \"right parts, then of course they won't\", 'know what to do. What to do. Actually,', 'what we spend a lot of time generally is', \"making the parts. And let's think about\", 'the human brain. I mean, the reason why', 'the human brain is remarkable is because', 'it has all these parts which are very', \"different. You know unlike let's say the\", 'liver the liver is relatively', 'homogeneous right a few cell types kind', 'like any part is like any other you look', 'at the brain and now you have thousands', 'of cell types I mean the recent', 'estimates you know said that there are', 'probably 2,000 cell types just in the', 'human brain right scattered through all', 'these nuclei and regions and the', 'remarkable abilities of the brain really', 'result from the cells interacting with', 'each other so in the early days like you', 'know 15 years ago we were making just a', 'few cells like a few spinal cord neuron', 'cells or maybe a few cortical neurons,', \"but then we've never really leveraged\", 'the ability of the cells to connect with', \"each other. And so that's where\", 'essentially assemblids came where once', 'we figure out how to make some of the', 'cell types, some of these brain regions,', 'putting them together essentially, you', 'know, was unleashing like new forces of', 'self-organization, which is really what', 'the brain does. I mean, the brain builds', 'itself at the end of the day, you know,', 'if you think about it, right? And and', 'and it reorganizes itself. Like if you', 'damage a part of your brain, it will', 'reorganize itself so that that function', 'might be taken up someplace else. At', 'least early in development. Yes. Early', 'in development, it will do so. And then', 'the more you progress, the the you know,', 'the the less you can the less that', 'happens, right? What if you leave your', 'cultured brain cells in the dish for 9', 'months, a year, what happens to them', 'then? Do they just take care of business', 'on their own or do they just fade away?', 'something crawls out of the petri dish.', 'There you go. You have the smartest dish', \"in the world. It'll chase you down the\", 'corridor. Get that fork away from me.', 'But that was something actually, you', 'know, really fascinating. We discovered', 'like, you know, almost 10 years ago. So', 'at one point we were, you know, my lab', 'was still like in the early days and at', 'one point, you know, we realized that', \"well, I mean, it's very expensive\", 'experiment. you have to keep feeding the', 'cells. And I was running out of money in', 'the lab. And so I told everybody in the', 'lab, I said, \"You better go in your', 'incubators and like make sure that', \"you're not maintaining cultures that we\", \"don't need. We need to focus. We need to\", 'save money.\" And then somebody in the', 'lab comes and says, \"Oh, should I also', 'like remove the ones that are like 300', 'days old?\" I was like, \"What do you mean', 'like 300 days old?\" It\\'s like, yeah, I', 'mean, you know, we you know, I I knew', 'that we were keeping them for very long', 'periods of time, but I had no idea that', 'we could keep them for such a long', 'period of time. And it turns out that', 'once you make this cluster of cells and', 'you know sort of like I wish I could', 'show you. I wish you were here in the', 'lab and I could show you. Maybe I can', 'try. They look something like this. All', \"right. I see it. They're a lot. They're\", \"still like fixed. You see? So they're\", 'like relatively large clumps of cells.', \"They're floating in the media in the\", 'incubators. You keep going and change', 'media. And then at one point we realized', 'we can keep them for very long periods', 'of time. In fact, we maintain now the', 'longest cultures that have ever been', 'reported. Like you can keep them for', 'years. And so now the question was are', 'they stuck in development? Are they', 'progressing in development? And through', 'a series of papers we discover something', \"really fascinating. It's like they\", 'actually keep track of time really well.', 'So well that once they actually arrive', 'at about 9 months of keeping them in a', 'dish, they actually transition in terms', 'of their gene expression and some of the', 'properties of the cells to a post-natal', \"brain. So it's almost like they know\", \"that birth should happen. Wow. There's\", 'almost like we think that there is some', 'sort of internal clock that keeps track', 'of time. Is this the brain clock that', \"I've read about? Yeah, this is the brain\", \"clock. Exactly. I'm fascinated now that\", 'these cells have the ability to', 'understand basically a calendar. I mean,', \"because they're not they're not\", 'observing the the sun going across the', \"sky a day and a night. Yeah. So, what's\", \"what's what's doing the tech?\", 'So, I mean, you may think that this is,', 'you know, surprising, but if you think', \"about it, it's not that surprising. I\", 'mean, every time you make a human,', \"you'll always make it in like 280 days.\", \"And and here's the interesting thing. If\", 'you take mouse stem cells, okay? Or we', 'have like chimp stem cells and you', 'differentiate them the same way in a', \"dish, they'll finish development in\", 'their own time in the same but and and', 'that t that same time period reflects', 'the gestation period of a chimp or', 'mouse. like it will be three weeks for', 'the rat and it will be like you know', 'whatever is for so this is I mean', 'evolution has actually selected you know', 'very well like the periods of', \"development and so they're intrinsic to\", 'the cells I think what we what was', 'surprising for us was that this happens', 'also outside of the of the body right', 'outside of the uterus of course this is', 'not to say that all aspect of', 'development are recapitulated I mean', 'there are all kinds of things that are', 'coming right all kind of informations', 'that are coming that are shaping', 'development and we know that the more', 'you invest In human brain development,', 'the more the environment is important', 'like sensory information, right? Like', 'cognitive development, think about motor', 'behavior afterwards. But especially at', 'early stages of development, everything', 'is quite well regimented and goes', 'according to a calendar. Nobody knows', 'what the clock is. So nobody knows what', 'the molecular mechanism of it is, but it', \"is somewhere in the cells. It's\", 'something that is counting somehow time.', \"And that's why it's such a great time to\", 'do neuroscience.', 'like more people should like come and', 'and do that. So where where do these', 'cells derive their energy from? Because', \"it's you know you talk about a clock,\", \"there's not a battery in the back. What\", \"is powering this? Cuz they're outside of\", \"they're outside of the body. They've not\", 'got the the whole human system to back', 'it up. So we feed them sort of like a', 'you know a soup of chemicals that is', 'made sort of like in the lab. So we like', 'we provide them glucose, right? I mean', 'they need glucose and some of the amino', 'acids and we give them lipids, right?', 'And so they need fats. And so we just', 'like have we call them cell culture', 'media. And and how do you measure if and', 'when they are expressing their', 'prescribed function? Cuz a neuron has a', 'very specific function. Absolutely. How', 'do how do you know that they are', 'actually expressing that function? So we', 'do all kind of things like first of all', 'we just look to see very often you know', 'cells I mean not very often all the time', 'cells have a signature you know they', 'express a certain combination of genes', 'and so generally the first question is', \"if you think you've made a cortical\", \"neuron let's say a neuron from the outer\", 'layer of the brain how do you know that', \"it's a cortical neuron well first of all\", 'you kind of like look at what genes it', 'expresses and you compare it with what', 'we know from a neuron in the actual', 'brain then you can look at how it looks', \"They're often neurons in the cortex have\", 'sort of like a pyramidal shape. We call', 'them parameal neurons. So you look Do', 'they look pyramidal? Pyramal. That means', 'like a pyramid. Yeah, exactly.', 'Pyramidal. Okay. For me, parameal. Yeah.', 'I guess they really look like a a tiny', 'pyramid. Yeah. An inverted pyramid. Like', \"that's how they sit in the cortex. So\", 'you look at this like the shape of the', 'of the cell body. Or the other thing is', 'sometimes they move in very specific', \"ways. And that's actually how the first\", 'assemblids were actually looking at how', \"cells are moving. So here here's an\", 'interesting fact. You know, you may', 'think that, you know, you have all the', 'cell types in the brain, right? But', \"they're all made, you know, when you\", \"build a brain, they're all made sort of\", 'like in their place and then they sit', \"there. Actually, it's more an, you know,\", 'a rule rather than an exception that', 'cells do not reside in the place in', \"which they're born in the brain. So\", 'there is a lot of movement. So think', 'about the cortex, okay? like the outer', 'layer of the brain. It has neurons that', 'are exciting other neurons and it has', 'neurons that are inhibiting other', 'neurons. And there is a very good', 'balance between the two of them. Too', 'much excitation, you get epilepsy,', 'right? So, you know, think about that.', \"Now, here's the interesting thing. All\", 'the excitatory neurons are born there in', 'the cortex. But all the neurons that are', 'inhibitory are built in a deep part of', 'the brain. And literally during brain', 'development they start moving crawling', 'for inches and for many many months', 'until they arrive into the cortex and', 'then they kind like establish that', 'balance. So in order for you to build', \"that cortex it's not enough just to make\", 'the excitatory cells you have to make', 'the inhibitory cells. But then the', 'question is how do they come together?', \"How do they assemble? because that's\", 'where the name assemblid came and', 'essentially the vision was like almost', \"you know 12 years ago was let's make\", 'these two parts of the brain the one', 'that makes the excitatory neurons and', 'the one that makes the inhibitor neurons', 'and then just put them close to each', 'other and hopefully the cells will know', \"what to do because we certainly don't\", 'know how to guide them to um to to move', 'and it turns out that exactly what they', 'do you put them together and these', 'gabbergic cells immediately start like', 'they have this processes the cellar', 'processes is they start like smelling', 'where the cortex is and they literally', 'start jumping. You know you see the', 'cells they literally spend 3 hours they', 'look in that direction and then they', 'make a jump 40 microns then they wait', 'for another 3 hours kind like smell', 'where the cortex is make another jump', 'and this process has never really been', 'seen in humans. This happens in the', 'third trimester of life but this is this', \"is what's going on in every developing\", \"human being what you're describing. So,\", \"professor, what you're saying is\", 'basically we have uh a bunch of cells', \"that uh are in a field and they they're\", 'looking and they recognize one another', 'and then they just start running to each', 'other in slow motion. Well, pretty much', 'pretty much because they really come', 'with instructions of how to do this and', \"I think that's what happens in\", \"development and that's why you build a\", 'brain. I mean our brains may be a little', 'bit different from each other but in the', \"grand scheme of things they're quite the\", 'same, right? I mean we have the same', \"structures. It's not like, you know, you\", 'have a phalamus in the spinal cord,', 'right? We all have pretty much in the', 'same position. So, in order for, you', 'know, the brain to build itself that', 'way, there are these remarkable forces', 'that bring all the cells together over', 'and over again every time you build a', 'human brain. Wow. I Okay, this is the', \"last thing. I'm sorry. I know we got to\", \"move on to the next subject, but here's\", 'what is like percolating in my brain', 'right now. Is this once you kind of', 'perfect this technology, would you be', 'able to then introduce these cells and', \"have them go in and let's say for\", 'instance, repair a part of my brain that', \"kind of makes me so stupid I don't\", 'believe in climate change or something.', 'Well, this sort of like a self assembly', 'actually works really well early in', 'development in the sense that all the', 'cells are open to like connecting with', 'the others. But then it turns out that', 'the as you progress in development, the', 'cells become less and less permissive.', \"We don't have cells moving in our brain\", \"right now. Okay? You know, it's just not\", 'very adaptive. So the challenge is that', 'if you start to add the cells into an', 'adult, like those circuits are already', \"formed. So it's not that easy. Got you\", 'know um to the dumbass circuitry. The', 'dumbass circuitry is fully formed and', 'very very strong. Right. However, if if', \"you're able prenatal to identify brain\", 'disorders or any disorder in a child,', 'you might be able during the gestation', 'process to go in and and and make uh', \"changes. Exactly. And that's exactly\", \"what we're do actually even early after\", 'birth because the human brain develops', \"for like years even after we're born.\", \"That's amazing. So, professor that that\", \"that's amazing. All right. So,\", 'professor, you did some work and some', 'research with cells and you said you', 'work with autism patients and the like', \"and there's something called Timothy\", 'syndrome which is autism and epilepsy', 'which seems a terrible combination to to', 'terrible for Timothy. Damn. Yeah. But', 'you then afflicted cells with this', 'Timothy syndrome. Is that correct? Yeah.', 'and then reverse engineered how you', 'could find a way to work with and do', 'basically what you said take that away', 'right is that could I mean I am', 'explaining that at all well but m you', 'probably could do it better than I if', 'you would so I mean this this goes back', 'to like you know the previous point when', 'we were talking about how the stem cells', 'were so like discovered and what the', 'potential was so the question was if you', 'really want to model a disease you know', 'you want to model a complex disease such', 'as autism them uh and epilepsy you know', 'where do you actually start I mean', 'psychiatric disorders are mysterious', \"disorder we still don't know how like\", 'this you know thoughts and this complex', 'social behavior arises in the brain so', 'actually we thought we would start with', 'genetics because one thing that we do', 'know about many of these', 'neurodedevelopmental disorders is that', \"they're caused by mutations they're\", 'caused by very severe mutations right so', \"there's this rare rare syndrome I mean\", 'literally there about we found about 30', '40 patients in the English speaking', 'world today very few but they have a', 'mutation this patient in a protein that', 'is actually a channel for calcium in the', 'cells every time a neuron communicates', 'with another neuron it opens up these', 'channels lets calcium in and it', 'essentially translates electrical', 'information into chemical information', 'inside the cell. So it turns out that', 'these patients have one single letter', 'mutation in their entire genome. one', 'single letter that makes this channel', \"open for a little bit longer. That's it.\", \"It's not all the time open. It's not,\", 'you know, just slightly longer. So, the', 'idea was that if you were to model this', 'disease, you could make neurons from', 'these patients, then look at them and', 'actually monitor calcium inside the', 'cells. And if we were to see more', 'calcium, it means that we started', \"modeling the disease. And that's exactly\", 'what we did because we wanted to really', 'ascertain that we were really studying a', 'disease process that is relevant. So if', 'if you know the actual letter and when', \"you you're talking about that you're\", 'talking about the DNA sequencing. So if', 'you know the actual letter, why not do', 'something like crisper where you just go', 'in and snip out the letter? Well, sadly', 'you would have to change it everywhere', 'in the brain probably. There you go. And', 'that and that is not you know doable', 'today. Okay. And these patients are very', \"severely affected. I mean they'll have\", \"epilepsy. They'll have autism spectrum\", 'disorder. They have a heart problem. So', 'many of them would die because of a', \"heart problem. And so that's that's\", 'where we sort of like started with with', 'cells from these patients. And then with', \"this models that I've told you now over\", 'the past 15 years, we kept building the', 'models to be more complex and try to', 'understand this disease. And first we', 'understood how calcium gets into the', 'cells. Then we saw that the cells are', \"not moving right. They're not connecting\", 'properly. And about three years ago,', 'which was, you know, one of the most', 'interesting, you know, times in in sort', 'of like my academic life, was at one', 'point we just accumulated enough', 'information about the disease that', 'essentially the therapeutic just became', 'self-evident, so to speak. You just like', 'look at it and they would say, \"Oh, oh,', 'this makes sense. This is what we need', 'to do.\" And so, I don\\'t want to go into', \"the details of how we've then does, but\", 'it it has to do with how this gene is', \"processed inside the cells. We've done a\", 'screen and essentially identify a tiny', 'piece of a nucleic acid that if you add', 'to cells goes right into them, changes', 'the channel and essentially restores', \"almost every single defect that we've\", 'discovered over the past 15 years. Damn.', 'Just like within, you know, a couple of', \"days. This is insane. I know. But that's\", \"what you're talking about. These are\", 'Sherlock Holmes. This is real detective', 'work to work out that that is exactly', \"what's necessary. I mean, you said it\", \"was obvious, but obviously it wasn't.\", 'Otherwise, someone would have seen it a', 'long time ago. So, if you were around in', \"Frankenstein's day, Frankenstein would\", 'could just been a regular Joe on the', 'street. Yeah. He would have walked out', 'instead of like he would have been like,', '\"Hey, what\\'s going on? How you guys', 'feeling?', 'Are you mapping this with sort of an AI', \"technology? I mean, Chris's one tool,\", 'but there are others out there. Is that', 'what it is, or is this just the', 'empirical evidence from experiment?\"', \"It's large largely empirical. I mean\", \"we've just you know just accumulated\", 'enough information about the biology', 'that at one point it became clear and', \"it's quite interesting if you think\", 'about it because this is could be the', 'first psychiatric disease that has been', 'exclusively understood with this human', 'stem cell models meaning by studying it', 'by studying human brain cells outside of', 'the body of those patients right and so', 'of course the question is like how do', 'you actually you know know that it would', 'work you know generally what we do is we', 'use an animal model for the disease', 'right? um you have an animal model, you', 'have a mouse that has the same mutation.', 'Well, it turns out that if you do this', \"mutation in a mouse, it doesn't really\", 'recapitulate aspects of disease. It', \"doesn't work that well. So now what do\", 'you do? You can also just go straight', 'into a patient. You want to make sure', 'that sort of like it it works sort of', \"like in an invivo setting. And so that's\", \"why one of the things that we've done\", 'over the past years is actually also', 'develop transplantation methods. Meaning', 'that while the organ and the assemblies', \"that we've been building are rather\", \"complex, they still don't receive\", \"sensory input. They don't mature to the\", 'same level. So what we started doing is', 'actually transplanting them. Meaning we', \"essentially take the organoid that we've\", 'made in a dish, but now we put it into', 'the brain of a rat. And then if you do', 'it early in development, then the rat', 'can actually grow to have about a third', 'of a hemisphere to be made out of human', 'cells. You can literally see it on an', 'MRI. And you may think well this is you', 'know why would you even do that', 'experiment? Well the reason is because', 'now we actually have human tissue from', 'patients in a living organism and you', 'can test a drug. So what we did is we', 'took the drug that we tested in vitro in', 'a dish but then injected it into the rat', 'the way you would do into a patient but', 'then we looked at the effect on human', \"cells making sure that it doesn't kill\", \"human cells right or it doesn't do\", 'something else. So that is like one way', 'that allows us actually to test', 'therapeutics in a way that is like safe', 'essentially. So the thing is if you want', 'to solve the issues of complex brain', \"disorders, you're going to need more\", \"complex assemblids. Mhm. Now you've\", 'taken this assemblid up a notch, have', 'you not? um daisy chained four organoids', 'together but then gone down the path of', 'sensory if you could sort of expand on', 'that for us because I think this is', \"absolutely fascinating. You're telling\", 'me they have feelings. Is this what', \"you're telling me? No, let the professor\", 'explain. No, you know, I mean it turns', 'out that if you if you think about like', 'brain disorders, you know, some of them', 'are sort of like hardware defects,', 'right? I mean parts are just missing.', 'Think about in a stroke, right? you like', 'you know you lose like parts of the', 'cortex but most disorders that we', 'consider today psychiatric autism', 'schizophrenia we think of them more as', 'like disorders of software of', 'communication between the cells. So it', 'becomes really clear that if you really', 'want to capture those processes outside', 'of the human body we sort of like need', 'to reconstruct those circuits outside.', 'And so this started like you know maybe', 'five six years ago when we thought could', 'we actually build a circuit that is', 'actually has an output you know really', 'easy to measure. So we decided to', 'reconstruct the cortical spinal pathway.', 'So that means and you you you know this', 'really well everybody knows this this is', 'like biology textbook information. You', 'have a neuron in the cortex that', 'generally goes all the way to the spinal', 'cord makes a connection or a syninnapse', 'with the spinal cord neuron and that', 'spinal cord neuron goes to muscle. You', 'have essentially three neurons, two', 'connections. You stimulate the cortical', 'neuron, information goes down to the', 'spinal cord to the muscle, the muscle', \"contracts, right? You know, it's as easy\", 'as like text of biology. So, we thought,', 'could we actually reconstruct this? You', \"may think that it's easy, but here is we\", \"don't know how the cells find each other\", 'in development. By the way, we have no', 'ideas about the rules. So, what we did', 'is we made an organoid that resembles', 'the cortex, one that resembles the', 'spinal cord, and then we made a ball of', 'human muscle from a biopsy. You can get', 'a biopsy of muscle, build it as a ball,', 'and then we put them all three together.', 'And it turns out that once you do this,', 'those specialized neurons in the cortex,', 'not every cortical neuron, but the ones', 'that really go to the spinal cord start', 'to leave the cortex, find the motor', 'neurons, then the motor neurons leave', 'and find the muscle, and then the three', 'preparation starts to contract. Wow.', 'That that would that was a three-part', 'assemblid. All right. And that that told', 'us that even you know against the odds', 'because the probabilities for the cells', 'to find each other is very very low. And', 'yet this works beautifully and you can', 'actually stimulate the cortex and you', 'get beautiful muscle contractions and', \"we've been using this uh you know really\", 'in the last years to identify for', 'instance how polio virus and other non-p', 'polio viruses actually affect the spinal', 'cord and cause paralysis which is very', 'difficult uh to study otherwise. So it', 'is a very important so like preparation', 'you can add this polio virus and you can', 'cause a paralysis of that circuit uh in', 'a dish. This work is not yet published,', 'but it tells you like just how useful a', \"preparation like this uh can be. It's\", \"beyond useful. I mean, I'm what I'm\", 'trying to figure not figure out envision', \"is a time where we've mapped like\", 'everything, right? So, you have you have', 'the layout. Now, would there be a time', \"because of what you're saying that we'll\", 'be able to go in identify in a child', 'that is developing in the womb and then', 'uh identify mutations and then take the', 'assemblides, put them into the child and', 'have those mutations corrected before', 'the child is born. Is that the deal?', 'Perhaps even an easier scenario for that', 'is that have a mutation. You know that', 'the patient will have a serious', 'mutation. You build an assembly that', 'models the disease of that patient', 'without using the patient brain. So like', 'an avatar if you want, right? I mean', \"that's what an assembly is if you think\", \"about it, right? It's an avatar for that\", 'circuit simplified in a dish. You test', 'the drug or you screen for drugs. Maybe', 'you want to screen quickly for drugs,', 'right? And then you use that in a', 'patient. So now you can do that for', \"every single patient. You don't have to\", 'actually uh do the process in any', 'particular patient because now you', 'developed a drug for the mutation', 'itself. Now just boom boom boom every', 'single person with that mutation gets', \"that drug delivered and and that's how\", \"you Wow, that's amazing. But to get\", 'there, we do need to get a better', 'understanding of how cuz you you see', \"we're quite why do wait why do you have\", 'to understand why the cells do what they', \"do? They're doing it. You already know.\", 'Why do you have to? Are you just that', 'news scientist?', \"That's right. Cuz he's a Look at Look at\", 'Neil. Neil\\'s looking at me like, \"How', 'dare you?\" He\\'s a scientist. How dare', \"you? We don't accept just what is. I\", 'understand. Go please. No, if you', 'actually think about like Richard Feman,', \"he famously said, and I'm sure you know\", 'this, that what I cannot create, I do', 'not understand. M and you know if you', 'think a little bit about this right if', 'we cannot recreate the circuits outside', \"it's going to be difficult for us to\", \"understand and if we don't understand\", 'the biology all the breakthroughs in', 'medicine that came over the last decades', 'think about cancer in children right in', 'the 60s 90% lethal today less than 10%', 'lethal why this entire revolution', 'molecular biology right because the', 'tissue of interest was accessible you', 'get the blood of these patients in', 'leukemia or the tumor, you bring it to', 'the lab and you deploy the power of', 'molecular biology. We in psychiatry and', 'neurology are really the last ones', 'because we cannot access the brain. So', 'my belief is that as we gain access to', 'the brain through this methods and', \"others non-invasively, we're going to be\", 'able to deploy the power of molecular', 'biology and make breakthroughs in', 'molecular, you know, psychiatry and', \"neurology as we've done in, you know,\", 'uh, cardiology and other branches of', \"medicine. That's that's sort of like how\", 'I see it, but I may be wrong. But', \"haven't you got an assemblid now that's\", 'like I said a four stage assemblid, but', \"you've worked it so as it's sensory and\", 'you can feel the understanding of pain', 'and then how that becomes hyper', 'sensitivity or to the point where people', 'do not feel pain at all. Oh. Oh, okay. I', \"thought you meant like they're going to\", 'have that little vial of just screaming', 'in the middle of the night.', 'Why did you give me pain? Not that one.', \"No, you're you're right that one of the\", \"things that we're trying actually this\", 'this just came out. I mean, we made the', 'first assemblid in like 2017. It took us', 'three years to make from go from', 'two-part assemblids to three-part', 'assemblids, the one with the motor that', 'I was explaining. And then it took us', 'another five years to get to four part', \"assemblies just because it's technically\", 'more and more complicated. And this is', 'the pathway that senses, you know, sends', 'your information. So, think about it. If', 'you, you know, want to sense anything,', 'even a painful stimulus on a finger, you', 'have nerve terminals that are coming', 'from neurons that sit close to the', 'spinal cord, they have receptors that', 'sense that. Then they send that', 'information to the spinal cord. The', 'spinal cord shoots that information up', 'to the phalamus in the middle of the', 'brain and the phalamus sends it to the', 'cortex and then you sense that something', \"happened. You know, that's how it works.\", 'So what we did is essentially we tried', 'to reconstruct that from part. So we', 'made neurons that have some of these', 'receptors including receptors for pain.', 'So you know the receptors for pain', 'actually respond to capsain you know red', \"hot chili pepper that's why it's like so\", 'hot. So they have this specialized', 'receptors and you add capsain and they', 'just beautifully respond like', 'electrically. But this had never been', 'witnessed before had it. No I mean to', 'put the entire circuit together has', 'never really been done before. Now the', 'biology for you to to witness this the', 'first ever time. Well, the most', 'beautiful part of it was to be honest', 'once we made the parts which took us', 'years you know the four parts of the', 'circuit and then put them together and', 'it takes about a 100 days to make them', 'by the way and then another 100 days for', 'the cells to connect with each other and', 'then at one point we started like', \"looking at them and seeing like what's\", \"going on and we've discovered something\", 'you know really remarkable the cells in', 'the circuit become synchronized with', 'each other. Mhm. So initially they were', 'all sparkling you know in a', 'non-coordinated way and then at one', 'point the activity just seems to be', 'starting on one side and it goes you', 'know one', 'unidirectional. So the circuit is almost', \"you know and there's no stimulus by the\", \"way you know the it's almost like which\", 'we know also from brain development that', 'the brain prepares itself before it even', 'receives sensory inputs for what is', \"about to come. It's almost like\", \"practicing. So it's practicing to add\", 'you know the stimulus and then the', 'relevance for pain is that there are', \"this interesting maybe you've heard\", 'about this neurologist discovered them', 'you know in the past 20 years there are', 'these patients that have mutations that', 'make them either completely insensitive', 'to pain so they literally feel no pain', \"and it's really caused by a mutation in\", 'a channel in a sodium channel or they', 'have the opposite they have this channel', \"hyper sensitive so they're hyper\", 'sensitive to pain both of them are', 'obviously very had. So now what we did,', 'we used crisper cuz we were talking', 'about crisper before and genetically', 'modified the cells in a dish to have the', 'mutations that are present in patients.', 'Then put them together all four and', 'started watching to see what happens.', 'And in the patients that have that hyper', \"sensitivity to pain, they're very\", 'sensitive to pain. You just see the', 'information going really really fast.', 'The cells are super active and they', 'sense it. But in the ones that have no', \"pain, it's not like there's no activity\", 'at all. Actually what we found is', \"there's a lack of coordination right the\", 'cells are essentially like lost that', \"coordination. So that's why it's so\", 'important to have the parts because', 'really at the end of the day you know', 'the brain is more than the sum of its', 'parts obviously and so clearly in order', 'to understand some of these disorders', \"we're going to need to have some of\", 'these parts put together to get this', 'emergent new properties not feeling pain', \"well that's the new that's the Novacane\", \"movie isn't it? Yeah, but you know that\", 'I mean we see this in certain people', 'that Okay, I remember we did on on the', 'TV show and Neil has this crazy thing.', 'He could stick his hand in water, ice', \"water. I'm not and I'm not saying it\", 'right. Take a bunch of ice, add water to', 'it, and it actually becomes colder than', 'freezing. Okay. Yes. All right. Then you', 'put your hand in it and it burns your', 'hand. So, we did an experiment and I', 'stuck my hand in and he stuck his hand', 'in and literally my hand started burning', 'in what a normal person would have their', 'hand burn. And then he was able to leave', 'his hand in there for a god awful amount', 'of time to the point where this you were', 'squealing at the time. Well, yes, I was', 'because it burned. It It was not cool.', \"So, not literally burned cuz it's cold,\", 'not hot, right? It not literally burned,', 'but it felt like it was burning. Okay.', 'But for you, for some reason, and you', 'know, I just chocked it up to he got a', 'lot more fat on his hands to get', \"But seriously, it's a matter of\", 'sensitivity to pain. No. Absolutely. No,', \"it's not. No. What is it? I I didn't say\", \"I didn't feel the pain. It's just that I\", 'could deal with it. Yeah. Oh,', 'well, that just changes. Oh, no. No. So,', 'okay. So, so explain to me the mind over', \"matter aspect here. Yeah, and that's a\", 'great point actually cuz you see this is', 'not the only pathway for pain. It turns', 'out that we have at least two pathways', 'in the brain. One of them allows you to', 'tell there is a painful stimulus. You', \"know I sense it, it's on my finger or my\", 'hand is in the water, not my feet,', \"right? That's the one that tells you\", 'that. And then there is a second pathway', 'that actually leverage other brain', 'regions, the amygdala, the singlet', 'cortex that tell you that that is really', 'bad. It gives you the unpleasant', 'feeling, the emotional component of', \"pain. And you know they're interesting.\", 'There are patients who dissociate', 'between the two. So there are patients', \"who let's say have a stroke or a tumor\", 'in the insula or in the singulate', \"cortex. And you'll have these patients\", \"and they'll tell you you know I know\", \"you're uh you know you're hurting like\", 'my finger and I can tell you that it is', \"my finger but it doesn't feel unpleasant\", 'at all. So these pathways are', 'dissociated in the brain. Now in the', \"work that we've done, we've\", 'reconstructed the basic pathway that', 'just processes pain stimuli, not the', \"emotional component. So we wouldn't say\", \"that they're feeling pain in any way.\", 'Right? Just to make it clear cuz as you', 'can imagine there are all kind of other', 'ethical issues that are arising from', 'like most of the work that we do', 'obviously because you know we want our', 'models to be closer to the human brain', 'because we think that many of the', 'psychiatric disorders are uniquely human', 'and yet the more the closer they are to', 'the human brain the more uncomfortable', \"we feel right so I think it's so like\", 'mitigating this risk moving forward that', 'I think is very important how how do you', 'now having had this experience with with', 'the sense sensor aspect of it. Reverse', 'engineer again the way to get a drug to', 'alleviate the hyper sensitivity to pain.', 'Sure. I mean there are many ways that', 'you can do this. So like now think about', \"it's God's guide. Well no everybody\", \"everybody everybody's got a thing with\", 'opioids but there must there must be a', 'mechanism there where opioids use that', 'you can sort of tag on to but not get', 'that addictive part. Exactly. And think', \"about it like it's it's sad that the\", 'best the best treatment that we have for', 'like pain comes out of like poppy seeds', 'and was discovered thousands of years', 'ago by chance, right? I mean essentially', 'piggybacks on this circuit does not come', 'from a deep understanding of the circuit', \"itself. Of the circuit, don't you make\", 'opium from poppy seeds? Yes. Okay. I', 'just want to clarify that. Yeah. So I', 'think the the idea now is that we have', 'the circuit in a dish. You can add', 'opioids by the way and see how they', 'modulate this and see okay this is what', \"opioids do to the circuit but let's now\", 'try to do the same thing in a different', 'way right right one that is sort of like', 'you know driven by the biology behind it', \"and I think that that's the beauty of it\", 'that is a beauty and by the way uh', 'professor if you ever get to that place', 'please email me right before you make', 'that public because I would like to be', 'the first', 'investor in the pain-free opiate that is', 'nonaddictive because that is I mean', \"that's the that's the end of the game\", 'right there. And just to be clear,', 'Chuck, what cuz when my hand was I just', 'want to like get back to my hand in the', 'bucket. Yeah. Okay. Long ago, right,', 'when I began wrestling in high school', 'and I was going to bring this up. I', \"think it's because you were an athlete\", 'and athletes have to deal with pain all', 'the time. Exactly. And I judge by', 'looking at the situation. Is this pain', 'something that will cause irreparable', 'damage or is it just simply pain? Okay.', \"And I'm looking at my hand is in a\", 'bucket of ice. Yeah, it hurts, but who', \"cares? But who cares? I'm not going to\", 'get frostbite from it. Okay. So, see,', \"you and Gary have that, I'm sure, cuz\", \"Gary's had a ton of surgeries. He's\", 'played in pl in pain. He sat in ice', 'after games, right? See, and I have not', \"played none of that. I've done none of\", \"that. And this is you. That's why you\", 'whimped out in the time of need because', 'this is how pain works for me. Okay. The', 'way pain works for me is I experience it', 'and then my brain, my body, and', 'everything in my soul goes, \"Jesus, no.', 'Please, Lord, no.\" So, oh, that\\'s', \"So when when you're saying you you're\", 'building these avatars and the detective', 'work that comes, are you finding more', 'clues and more answers or are you just', 'finding clues and then we got to sit', 'there, scratch our heads and hopefully', 'come up with an answer or is this really', 'empowering the sort of psychiatric', \"research that you're interested in?

Stanley', 'Miller was a PhD student I think he', 'published a paper in 1953 so it was a', 'long time ago but basically he put you', 'know a bunch of molecules that might', 'have been available on the

like\", 'a like a virus could be an alien like', 'highly effective like lots of', 'information carrying out like uh you', 'know purpose uh procreating', 'you know I mean it when you if if you', 'can look for something like that how do', 'you even begin to uh narrow the search', 'once you start looking out there yeah so', 'the great thing about assembly theory is', 'we can actually measure uh how

'this is physics badass physics coming in', 'in the doorway here all right so we like', 'measurements they ground Us in reality', 'right evolutionary steps sometimes we', 'think of them that way is

doesn't help us understand life\", 'on other planets or solve the original', \"life because we don't know where life\", 'comes from to begin with so we need have', 'a sample of one yeah we have a sample', \"one it's a big problem we need a deeper\", 'explanation of evolution in order to', 'explain how evolutionary systems that we', 'recognize as biology emerg in the first', 'place is there any chance that it could', 'just be a mistake you know that might be', \"true but then it's not very interesting\", 'from the perspective of theoretical', \"physics cuz there's nothing to explain\", 'um okay oh good answer yeah I mean it', \"doesn't stop the search though but\", \"you're right it's not it's not very uh\", \"interesting at that point so let let's\", \"make sure we're on the same page here\", 'when I think of how a biologist would', \"Define life which has been there's been\", 'variations on that over the decades but', \"what comes to mind is it's something\", 'that has a', 'metabolism so it uses energy from its', 'environment it reproduces and it evolves', 'D in a darwinian way yeah you have', 'things to add to that subtract from that', \"I I don't or can you just oppose both\", 'what do you what do you call what he', 'just said in from your where you are', 'what is that and then where are you', 'different so so one definition that', 'people like to use which ENC capitulates', \"what you're saying as like fundamental\", 'pieces of it is life is a', 'self-sustaining chemical system capable', \"of darwinian evolution it's quite a\", 'mouthful um that is what he just said', 'though yeah it is exactly exactly what', \"he it it totally is so you know there's\", 'a lot of problems actually from my', 'perspective with that definition um one', 'of them is whether you regard life to be', 'self- sustaining so viruses are an', \"example people don't know whether to\", 'place them as life or not um because', \"they're not self-sustaining on their own\", \"and in fact when we're doing uh you know\", 'chemical evolution in the laboratory', 'like trying to study molecules uh you', \"know we don't know how to call them\", \"alive because they're not\", 'self-sustaining because graduate', 'students are pipeing you know like they', 'require the graduate student um so', \"pipetting that's a verb p it's a little\", 'thing a little glass draw in there yeah', 'yeah so yeah you got to you got to move', 'the molecules from one tube to the next', 'to do artificial why you doing you say I', 'am crushing your head okay sorry right', \"so so there's many or or my favorite\", 'example is like you know a parasite that', 'um you know sits in the the brain of an', 'ant and you know Pilots the ant right so', 'I I talk about that example in my book', \"love that Parasite by the way it's so\", 'crazy but is that is that a living is', \"that a life form cuz it's actually you\", \"know it's a symbi an right so or\", 'actually a parasite um so this idea of', 'self- sustaining is kind of very', 'problematic for a lot of uh reasons I', \"don't actually think life is defined by\", 'chemistry so this is again getting at', 'deeper physical principles wow so I um', 'include', 'technology yeah first shots fired yeah', 'okay yeah so my definition or well my', \"understanding of life I don't have a\", 'definition my understanding of Life Is', 'Life is the things that can only be', 'produced by Evolution and selection and', 'technology is also example of that and', \"that's not chemical um and also this\", 'idea of it being self- reproducing I', 'mean there are plenty of humans that', \"can't self- reproduce actually no human\", 'can individually self- reproduce right', \"I've been trying but there's plenty of\", \"things I've been trying\", 'yeah but but but a mule for example is', \"certainly a liive can't reproduce can't\", 'reproduce yeah and those are those are', 'kind of odd examples cuz cuz we bred', 'them but even if you think of like a bee', 'in a colony right like most of the bees', \"can't reproduce alone or they not alive\", \"because they're part of a social network\", 'so so so the traditional definition of', 'Life have issues lots of issues every', 'single word plus there there are stars', 'that have metabolisms and they live out', 'their lives and die and then they', 'explode and send their materials to', 'other gas clouds that make other stars', \"so they do reproduce and there's some\", 'heritability there because of the', 'elements that get made in one star', 'generation one star goes into another so', 'are stars alive right we can ask that', 'question yes we could so can ask any', 'question so why even have a definition', 'at all so I think definitions are useful', 'hortic in the absence of having a more', 'fundamental understanding and so one of', 'my favorite um sort of analogies that', 'people in my field make is like how', 'would you define water before you knew', 'atomic theory you would describe it as', 'like a clear liquid it might you know be', 'a liquid at room temperature but you', \"wouldn't really understand what water is\", 'until you understand what atoms are and', 'how they combine to make H2O um and', \"that's sort of where we are with\", 'definitions of life we can kind of', 'describe effectively its properties but', \"we macroscopic yeah you know what you're\", \"look you know what you're looking at you\", \"just don't know really what it is yeah\", \"that's exactly right right and I want to\", 'know really what it is I want to know at', 'the same level that we understand our', 'other theories of physics like gravity', 'or quantum mechanics you have', 'disentangled yeah the definition of Life', \"yeah from people's biases right like a\", 'chef yeah like when they cooking the', 'primordial', 'soup when when they deconstruct when', 'they deconstruct the dish deconstruct', \"the dis and you see all the you're like\", 'what the hell is that I know right', 'I I had eggplant Parmesan the eggplants', 'here the CH I said dude what am I paying', 'you to do exactly the the parmesan shows', 'up on', \"Tuesday all right so so let's get back\", 'to this any good', \"theory in fact I I'm I'm a theory snob\", \"okay forgive me I love that no it's okay\", \"I'm also a theory snob no Theory snob in\", 'me about your I want to know what your', \"definition of theor I'm not sure that's\", 'a very good theory at all', \"that's not the kind of theory that we\", 'would let into this club no de who', 'sponsored', \"you sorry I'm sorry if you have an idea\", \"that you're still testing MH then we\", 'should call it a', \"hypothesis and once it's tested and\", 'verified and supported by multiple', 'people and not just your lab in the', 'Beyond Institute or Beyond Center then', 'it can Elevate to the level of a theory', 'which gives us the thermodynamics Theory', 'quantum theory relativity Theory but', \"it's not Sarah's Theory until it's\", 'multiply supported I would call it', \"Sarah's hypothesis and your colleagues\", 'your hypothesis am I allowed will you', \"grant me that I'll grant you that I\", 'think there are clear reasons why we', 'called a theory and for me what theories', 'are is are explanatory paradigms like', \"they're actual Frameworks that have\", 'brought have to predict something that', 'we have found have you what have you', 'predicted that we have found we have', 'predicted that there should be a', 'threshold above which only molecules', \"produced by life should reside and we've\", 'tested that experimentally wait wait', 'wait wait wait wait see I missed that', 'the Universe can generate comp you know', \"simple molecules it can't generate\", 'complex molecules without Evolution and', 'selection that suggests a boundary', 'experiment a boundary that just random', \"chemistry can explore but it can't go\", \"beyond oh and we've tested that with\", 'living and non-living samples and even', 'some that NASA sent and this was done by', \"Lee cronin's lab they sent samples and\", 'they blinded them and they tried to conf', 'like you know a blinded sample is one', \"that you don't know the identity of the\", 'sample and they tried to really trick', 'them they sent them merch and meteorite', 'which is one of the most complex', 'inorganic non-biological samples in the', 'solar system and it still classified the', 'experimental uh approach still', 'classified it correctly as non-living um', 'and what we saw was only the living', 'samples had an assembly index value this', 'number of minimal steps above 15 which', \"is not a magic number it's just an\", 'experimentally confirmed number so so', \"you're suggesting that nowhere in the\", 'universe without some other driving', 'foring on the system would give you a', 'complexity higher than this about 15 but', 'that was for a specific set of chemical', 'like kinds of bonds that can form so we', \"don't know if 15 is a universal number\", 'it might be different in a different', 'planet with different geochemistry but', 'the threshold is there is is the point', 'so that was the first prediction that', \"we've made that we've tested and also\", \"the other thing that we have that hasn't\", 'come out yet is actually constructing', \"phog gentic trees hasn't been published\", \"yet hasn't been published yet uh\", 'constructing phog gentic with no genomic', 'information just molecular information', 'taking it stuff down to molecules', 'molecules molecules contain their', 'history wow but I think your point is', 'really important about a theory and', 'obviously like this theory is still', 'under development but I think theories', 'have played a really important role in', 'the history of physics in terms of', 'trying to unify a broad set of phenomena', 'that we thought were different I would', 'just initially I would just call them', 'hypothesis yeah I think that would then', 'later be elevated to Theory once it has', 'been verified yeah you should kind of', 'drop it down hypothesis cuz then when', \"it's elevated we can call it Sarah\", \"Theory I don't want it to be called\", 'Sarah Theory though what do you mean you', \"don't want it to be called sah Theory\", 'course what it does is speaking as a as', 'a educator yeah what it does is it', 'protects the usage of the word theory', 'for things that are experimentally', 'objectively true right right otherwise', 'you get people in Congress I', 'quote we should teach Evolution only as', 'a theory', 'uh and therefore teach other theories as', 'well Evolution it was trying to get God', \"in there and so so which we're\", 'susceptible right if a theory is', \"something that's sort of in progress and\", \"we don't not really sure yet and then it\", 'gets shown to be false people will say', \"well we're waiting for the day that\", 'relativity theory is shown to be false', \"that's not going to happen yeah right so\", \"it's I know I understand that I think\", 'working from the scientist side of it', \"it's really interesting because I think\", \"also I've noticed that you know\", 'distinguishing between a model and a', \"theory is hard that's another one yeah\", 'yeah yeah so these are this is on some', \"level it's semantic but it's semantic\", 'just it makes my job easier if we get', 'the semantics right we want your job to', \"be easier don't mess with my trying to\", \"so again you're telling me left to its\", 'own devices the universe can construct', 'molecules of complexity level 15 in your', 'units of complexity yes uh Paradigm yes', 'okay after that what does it require it', 'requires a system that has some', 'constraints on what kind of molecules', 'get produced that favors one kind or', 'another favors selection selection', \"there's that word we're back to we're\", 'back to that okay I Goa so whereas', 'whereas getting to a complexity level of', \"15 does not require that that's right\", 'and so a key component of passing that', 'threshold is actually storing memory in', 'the system because you have to remember', 'the steps mhm so you can get to it every', 'time', \"that's right oh otherwise it's just\", 'randomly getting oh my gosh yeah that', 'makes sense oh yeah you have to know', 'what not to do in order to know what to', \"do so you're saying this meteorite and\", 'this meteorite can both get to', 'complexity level 15 because they both', 'formed in the void of the early Universe', 'the early solar system but without a', 'driving force yeah without something to', 'remember molecules that the meteorite', 'has made in the past and then build', \"further complexity on top of that can't\", 'do it so now you need some you need a', 'system to store information and DNA can', 'do that', 'yes famously yes H so is do well I guess', \"there's no way to know I was going to\", 'say is DNA because like all of', \"everything around us you know that's\", 'organic we all share this right so does', 'is that is that optimized in any way for', 'life do we look at that as a model that', 'is optimized I like that you because the', \"merchants and meteorite doesn't contain\", 'living molecules right all right so uh', \"if you're going to get what anyone would\", 'call', \"life why doesn't it select the same path\", \"because this is a question that's come\", 'up uh my colleagues in', \"geology pose the question and I didn't\", 'have a good answer it was an intriguing', 'question they look at multiple planets', \"and they're finding the same rocks this\", \"comes directly out of what you're saying\", 'they find the same rocks even though', \"it's a completely different planet yeah\", 'same rocks that is they understand the', 'bio the the the the The Rock chemistry', 'of what they the composition and the', \"like there's Basalt there there's Basalt\", 'here okay they came out of a volcano', \"volcano here volcanoes there why can't\", 'life have the same consistency that', \"geology does it's it it's because of the\", 'complexity well say that you have an', 'answer for that yeah you come out of', 'your assembly Theory with an answer to', \"that yeah that's right can you assemble\", \"something like DNA that isn't DNA that\", 'would be that would oh', 'oh watch out hello okay Sor you buried', 'the lead okay sorry okay oh my God okay', \"sorry all right all right so so that's\", 'amazing what prel can store information', 'for you and and go beyond your 15 Steps', 'that and do you have this thing locked', \"up that's that is what I I have to say\", \"I'm a theorist not an experimentalist so\", \"I haven't built these things myself but\", 'there I mean even but even in the Bas of', 'just synthetic biology people have', 'alternatives to DNA and RNA which are', 'the usual let me just remind people', 'synthetic biology is basically', 'genetically modified organism right', \"that's what that is it's got this new\", \"branding but it's that's what it's start\", 'we start

you figure out how you make the non', 'addictive molecule bind in such a way', 'that you get the result of the opioid', 'without y so you can look at the steps', 'to making both kinds of molecules

Perhaps', \"a misguided mission, but yeah, that's\", \"the goal. That's not No, that's a great\", 'mission. I mean, you know, yeah, the', 'internet is a cesspool of misinformation', 'and disinformation.

It's a good question.\", \"So, I think there's been the transition\", 'obviously from print to radio to', 'television to now social media. I think', 'it was that last gap which is really', 'democratized.

And now everyone can get', 'their information. They can get their', 'information out. Yeah.', \"And so there's been this big shift and\", \"of course it's now entertainment, the\", 'medical information on Tik Tok and', \"Instagram.

You'll find there's\", 'seven other people who think exactly the', \"way you do and there's a false\", 'affirmation.', 'So, how do you sort that out for people?', 'Yeah. So I mean that confirmation bias', 'is really confirmation bias really', \"really hard to escape and unless you're\", \"very thoughtful about doing so you won't\", 'escape it. You have to be intentional', 'and being intentional of course takes a', 'lot of mental energy which you may not', 'have.

Does it', 'still say let me go get more of this', 'information because that just makes it', 'even worse for you then. Yeah. So the', 'algor the way I think of algorithms is', \"really of people's attention like what\", \"is holding people's attention and so\", 'inescapably platforms seek to optimize', 'how long are people going to stay on our', 'platform and see more ads. the business', 'model.

I guess I', \"think there's truth to that. You can\", 'learn a lot about somebody just by', 'looking at 10 videos on their feed or', \"something. Probably it's one of the\", \"deepest ways to, you know, that's scary.\", 'Yeah, it is. It is. Yeah. But now I now', 'I just hit not interested because', \"although here's the problem. The reason\", 'I hit not interested is cuz I was', 'watching it. This stuff would come', 'across and I\\'d be like, \"Oh my god, is', 'it Tuesday?\" I just spent the whole day', 'watching people get the crap beat out of', \"them and I didn't want to.

Even if intellectually you', \"think it's not good for me. So, as an\", 'influencer, you need to be sensitized to', 'that so you know how to navigate it for', 'what you create and what you and what', 'your expectations are, right, for the', \"audience. So, Gary, why don't you give\", 'us a laundry list here? All right.', \"before we do because you're fighting\", \"this disinformation. You can't just go\", 'on to your platform and say, you know,', \"don't watch that, don't listen, you're\", \"dumb. No, you just there's because this\", 'is immediately causing a problem. So,', 'what are your strategies to actually get', 'across and and make this information', \"more acceptable to people who wouldn't\", 'necessarily want to know? Let me ask', 'that better, of course.', '[Laughter]', 'in English. Why should anyone listen to', 'your ass instead of anybody else if', \"you're both talking medicine online?\", 'Yeah. So, there is this tension of who', 'are you trying to talk to? Is it people', 'who already agree with you in which case', 'you may sort of go for sensationalized', 'approaches to a topic or is it people in', 'the middle who are undecided in which', 'case you may take a more nuanced', 'approach to discussion. If you want to', 'change minds, you have to do number two.', 'The problem with doing number two is', \"it's inherently less interesting than\", 'speaking to people who already agree', \"with. It's less It's not as good\", \"clickbait. It's not. So, you have to\", 'figure out strategies in the first half', 'a second, 5 seconds to kind of make it', \"entertaining whether it's and I've done\", 'some pretty embarrassing videos where', 'the whole theme of the video is POV', \"point of view. We're dancing at a party\", \"and I'm like dancing on screen while I'm\", 'exploring some medical topic. And the', \"only reason I'm doing these bad dance\", 'moves on screen is to keep it', \"entertaining while I'm discussing.\", \"Clear. They're bad dance moves, not\", 'badass dance moves. Well, just to be', 'clear, it depends on the video.', 'But there has to be something to get', 'people watching. Mhm. All right. So, so', \"there's some there's some common medical\", 'topics that people have strong opinions', 'about and have chosen their expert who', 'feeds them this information. So, you', \"compile the list. All right. Let's let's\", \"let's start off with the one that's\", 'obviously popular. Is there a cure for', 'cancer that they are keeping secret?', \"It's always they. The they. They. Yeah.\", 'They they being the pharmaceutical', 'companies and the government researchers', 'and the university researchers', 'collectively, tens of thousands,', 'hundreds of thousands of people. Cuz you', \"know, it's easier to make money off of\", 'the treatment than it is the cure. Yeah.', \"And I'm like, clearly you know nothing\", 'about pharmaceutical companies. Cuz let', 'me tell you something. If they had a', \"cure for cancer, it'd be like, yes, we\", 'have the cure. it is $1 million per pill', \"and that happens. That's part of the an\", \"there's there's a few ways to answer\", 'this question. One is the biology of the', 'cancer itself. One is from the', \"pharmaceutical company's perspective and\", 'one is from social media perspective.', \"But certainly like you're saying there\", 'are cures for some cancers, right? You', \"can't consider all cancer one thing.\", \"It's hundreds of different diseases.\", 'There will never be a treatment for all', 'cancers. But we have right now some', 'really really good treatments for', 'cancers where 50 years ago 70 years ago', 'survival rates were basically 0%. The', 'most common pediatric cancer acute', 'lymphablastic leukemia allliterally from', '0% in the 1950s. Today something like', '90% success rates with treatments. Wow.', \"And in the 10% of patients who don't\", 'respond well initially there are backup', 'treatments like CARTT cell therapies', 'which happen to cost hundreds of', 'thousands of dollars but are super', 'effective. Yeah. Yeah. And so the point', 'is, you know, over time research does', 'develop treatments for specific cancers.', 'When they work really well, you can', 'charge lots of money. And you can bet', 'that if pharmaceutical companies could', 'sell that treatment for all cancers and', 'multiply their market size by 30fold,', 'they would be jumping at the opportunity', \"to do so, right? So where's the ethical\", 'compass for a pharmaceutical company on', \"the pricing? Yes. Yeah. I believe it's\", 'the twisting of the mustache.', \"That's how the compass works.\", 'Yeah. So in that example of right or the', 'biting of the pinky,', 'you check the bank account balance and', 'notify the shareholders. Right. So part', \"of it is there's this limited period of\", 'patent exclusivity where you make as', 'much money as you can to try to justify', \"all of your R&amp;D that you've done up\", 'until that point and then you get', 'generics which are much cheaper. So', 'cislatin first testicular cancer', 'metastic testicular cancer used to be', 'super low survival rate then researchers', \"discovered cislatin this drug you've\", 'reduced mortality by something like', 'twothirds I think since the 1970s wow', \"it's generic now I think the cost of a\", \"vial I don't know exactly it's like tens\", 'of dollars hundreds of dollars so you', 'get this initial period where you can', 'make a lot of money off of a new drug', 'right and then everybody else gets to', 'compete with you in that drug you see', \"the how much time is it uh I can't\", 'remember the exact number maybe 10', 'years, 15 years. It differs for chemical', 'drugs or biologic drugs. But wait,', 'biology is just a extreme expression of', 'chemistry. Yeah. So, how do you', 'distinguishing chemical drugs from', 'biological drugs? So, chemical drugs', 'being like small molecule maybe a better', 'example biologics like antibbody drugs.', \"Um, where it's this protein that's been\", 'synthesized by cells. Dr. Vaccines would', 'come under that category. Vaccines I', \"think are biologics. Yeah, that's what\", \"I'm saying. Yeah. But you see stuff like\", 'metastatic melanoma used to have a', 'median survival time. And when I say', \"used to, I'm talking about the 2000s,\", 'like 2010, median survival time of six', 'to nine months. This is skin cancer.', 'Skin cancer that has spread to your', 'lymph nodes and maybe other places in', 'the body. Horrible prognosis until', 'people developed what is currently a', 'very expensive treatment. Melanin', \"and the reason it's expensive is cuz\", \"it's hard as hell to be black.\", \"Tell me I'm lying. Well, a warning for\", 'sun suninduced skin cancer. Yeah. Okay.', \"So you can't totally discount risk of\", 'skin cancer. Of course. Right. So just', 'to be precise, the evidence that I know', 'says that white people are 25 times more', 'likely to contract skin cancer than', 'black people. All because of the', 'melanin. But the risk not zero. No. Bob', 'Marley died of skin cancer. Yeah. He was', 'light-skinned though. No, stop. No. No.', 'It was on the bottom of his foot. It', \"wasn't sun induced. Wow. It wasn't sun\", 'induced. It was just Yeah. Yeah. back to', 'your your Yes. Anyway, the cure for that', 'metastatic melanoma 2010 median survival', \"time 6 to9 months. Wow. Today it's I\", \"think it's almost 10 years. Wow. And so\", 'the difference is that people have been', 'doing all this basic and translational', 'research. Now we have drugs called', 'checkpoint inhibitors that modify your', 'immune system. So your immune system can', 'now go attack the cancer better. Right.', \"And they're very expensive. Yeah.\", 'Hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yeah.', \"They're currently on patent. I think\", \"most of them are on patent. They're\", 'going to become generic. They will', 'become less expensive, but I can tell', 'you the companies that make them right', 'now would love to sell them for every', 'cancer out there if they had data', 'showing it worked for every cancer out', 'there. Also, you get to re-up the patent', 'for the different uses. So, if like if', 'you can modify the drug in any way to', \"treat something else, that's a brand new\", \"patent. There's a downstream effect of\", \"these drugs to find out they've got\", 'other applications. Exactly. So it has', \"to be a meaningful you can't just tinker\", 'with it and try to be cute and then say', 'we got a new patent because what people', \"will do is say well that's not a\", \"meaningful difference. We're still just\", 'going to use the generic of your first', 'drug. It works just as well. So you', 'really do have to make you really got to', 'make a it has to be a true alteration.', 'Right. Ah okay that makes sense. Does', 'big farmer suppress natural remedies', \"because they aren't profitable? Which\", \"kind of touches on what we've just been\", \"discussing. Yeah. I shouldn't say yeah.\", \"I should say no. That's the start to\", \"that question. There's actually a huge\", 'number of drugs that have natural', \"origins. And I'll think of a few\", 'examples. Aspirin is a good example from', 'I think willow bark for thousands of', 'years. People took it and turned it into', 'salves or ointments or whatever it was', 'for the same properties. A chemist', 'figured out. I forget what year, but you', 'know, this is the active compound in', \"willow bark that's having these effects.\", 'If we modify it a little bit, it reduces', 'the gastrointestinal side effects. We', 'sell that now as aspirin. And clearly', 'aspirin is not very expensive. No. yet.', 'Or should that be the buffered aspirin', 'that protects your stomach lining? Uh,', 'right. Cettoic acid. Yes. Versus', \"salicin. I'm not a chemist. Okay. Okay.\", 'Um, sound like one.', \"But go ahead. But basically, and that's\", 'one example. I think like I forget the', 'number 30 40% of all drugs FDA approved', 'drugs do have a natural origin either', \"directly from nature or it's been\", 'modified a little bit and then used as a', 'and how much of that was studied from', 'indigenous cultures that had long', 'traditions some of healing was like if', \"there's the story of people have used\", 'this plant for hundreds or thousands of', 'years researchers take it isolate all', 'the compounds put it in this huge panel', 'against a cancer target for example and', 'you get a psychedelic', 'those were found every every culture has', 'found that without doubt in the plants.', 'So, the misconception I think is if it', \"looks like a pill, it's not natural. But\", \"it's very possible that the molecules in\", 'there came from the bark of some tree.', 'Absolutely. I I I I hate when I hear', 'people say, \"Oh, it\\'s not a natural', 'remedy.\" And I\\'m like, \"Here\\'s the', \"thing. Everything that's happening in\", 'your body is happening on a molecular', 'basis.\" So, these people have found a', 'way to figure out a way to isolate the', \"molecular compounds, and it's the same\", \"thing. So now you don't have to eat a\", 'bushel full of weeds. You can just take', \"a pill, dummy. It's called progress.\", 'Anyway, sorry. Okay, so progressing. Are', 'raw diets, i.e. raw milk, raw meat,', \"healthier because they're more natural.\", \"And then we've got a caveat here. What\", 'about pink Himalayan sea salt versus', 'regular table salt? Great. Both very', 'closely related. The answer is no. Watch', 'where you step there. I have Himalayan', 'salt and I spent a lot of money on it.', 'People will claim, you know, the pink', 'salt has 400% more of this mineral', 'compared to regular table salt. If', 'neither of them in the first place were', 'supplying a a meaningful amount of that', 'nutrient or mineral to your health,', \"right? It's not a difference. And so the\", 'risk is actually if you think what', \"you're saying is 400 times a small\", 'number is still a small number. Exactly.', \"Right. It's 1% versus 4% of your daily\", \"intake and you're getting more from\", 'eating a mango or whatever it might be', 'otherwise. And so the risk is if people', 'think pink Himalayan sea salt is healthy', \"for me, now you're using more of it on\", 'your food. And the real health impact is', \"second order. It's now you're eating\", '3,000 milligrams of salt per day instead', \"of 1500 because you think it's giving\", 'you these health effects, right? And', \"then you'd have risk for hypertension or\", 'whatever. And the number one contributor', 'to hypertension is salt intake. So I', 'mean aside from heredity, like you know,', 'so first is yeah, all that kind of but', \"first is being black. Then, let's be\", \"honest, okay, let's you black, you gonna\", 'get high blood pressure. Uh, but then', \"it's your lifestyle and then sodium\", 'intake, you know. Yeah. And the raw milk', \"is similar. Um, there's no meaningful\", 'benefits to consuming raw milk or raw', 'meat compared to the pasteurized', 'version. And so, people will blow this', 'weight up proportion. I think this is', 'where people get tribalized on social', 'media. You have people who very', 'passionately only drink raw milk or who', 'otherwise say if you do drink raw milk', \"you're going to die or something. Oh, so\", \"that's the polarization of that\", \"decision. Exactly. And so people's lived\", 'experiences are well I drink raw milk', 'all the time and so do my friends and', 'none of us have died. What are you', 'talking about? Right. And realistically,', 'you know, maybe hundreds or a couple', 'thousand people may be hospitalized per', \"year from doing it. It's not a big risk,\", \"but it's an unnecessary risk because\", \"there's no benefit from drinking raw\", 'milk compared to pasturized. But the', 'people who say there is a benefit, what', 'reasons are they giving? Yeah. And what', 'and what what are the supposed benefits?', 'Cuz this is this got really big a couple', 'of months ago. It got huge. It was a', \"movement. And it's because of this polar\", 'people like identify as raw milk as an', 'anti-establishment statement almost. And', \"there are proposed things like it's got\", 'these undenatured proteins or enzymes or', 'live bacteria in it. Okay. Which', 'mechanistically we think will help your', \"health. I haven't seen any evidence to\", 'support any of those actual benefits as', 'being truly beneficial. But somebody', 'came up with it. Yeah, they did to', \"assume that it's true. Right. And I know\", 'who that guy was.', 'Okay, moving on. But are GMO foods bad', 'for your health?', 'For your health, no. I have no concern', 'eating a genetically modified food. M', \"the fact that there's a modified gene in\", 'there or leading to a modified protein,', 'you digest it just like any other', 'protein or DNA in all the food that we', 'eat. There is though sort of a second', \"level of effect. It's not bad from you\", 'eating the modified corn or whatever,', \"right? And I'm not an expert on this\", 'part, but what are the environmental', 'impacts of now having this monoculture', 'and having companies being in control of', 'the seeds that are used to make that', 'particular product uh or different', 'pesticide use that are specific for', 'those modified things? Those are all', 'separate questions from if I eat this', 'modified soy or corn, is it going to', 'directly harm my health? To that part,', 'the answer is very clearly no. Right?', \"So, what you're saying is that there are\", 'separate arguments that you can make', 'against GMOs, but not the one that talks', \"about whether or not it's harmful to you\", 'physiologically. Right. Right. And', \"there's quite a lot of, you know,\", 'decades of research from very large', \"populations showing there's not health\", 'risks from eating the modified version', \"of this. And by the way, aren't isn't\", \"most aren't most crops monocrops? Yeah.\", \"I mean, whether or not it's GMO, I mean,\", \"isn't I don't know the answer to that. I\", 'know for like corn and soy and stuff, I', 'think like 90% plus are GMO, right?', \"Okay. So, if you're eating any cornbased\", \"product, um, and maybe there's something\", 'to be said there. If the process of GMO', 'makes corn more available in our diet', 'and that meaningfully shifts the overall', \"food profile that we're eating, maybe\", 'that shift has an impact on our dietary', 'intake overall as a culture. True. has', 'nothing to do with the corn itself', 'versus an unmodified corn, right? And by', \"the way, I don't know if you've ever\", 'seen heirloom corn, but screw that crap.', \"Okay. Like the corn that's modified is\", 'juicy and delicious. Yeah. Sweet and', 'everything. Like not this pink and', 'purple and blue shriveled up little', 'thing that you know they call corn.', 'Yeah.

These types of', 'broader public health initiatives, if', \"you take them away, it's not going to\", 'harm everyone equally, assuming there is', \"a benefit. Interesting. Who's it going\", 'to most deeply impact? The people who', 'have least access to dental care, who', 'have least access to fluoridated', 'toothpaste and regular toothbrushing,', \"right?

That's a major red flag. So,\", 'if you see somebody telling you, \"Oh,', 'this autoimmune disease and this cancer', 'and this heart disease are all due to a', 'deficiency in these three vitamins,', 'which if you go to the link in my bio, I', 'happen to be selling in a in a vial for', '$90 per month.\" Can you really trust', 'that these very broad statements? First', 'of all, making broad statements like', \"that, there's a reason why people see\", 'individual nutritionists and dietitians', \"and doctors. It's because you can't give\", 'prescriptive advice like if you take', 'more vitamin D, you can solve your', \"autoimmune disease. That's simply not\", \"true. But if you're selling a vitamin D\", \"capsule, you're very motivated to make\", \"that type of statement. Okay, so that's\", \"that's another red flag there. However,\", \"just because they're selling it to you\", \"doesn't mean it doesn't work. Correct?\", 'So, this would only mean you just want', 'to be a little more cautious, right?', \"Right. But it's not an immediate\", 'disqualifying event. Exactly. So, I', 'would start from a place of skepticism', 'to start. And then if you see, oh,', \"there's conflict of interest and they're\", \"presenting only anecdotes and they're\", 'being sensationalized and exaggerating', \"and they're claiming that this one\", 'particular treatment is helping with', \"five different diseases and they're\", \"really charismatic and they're really\", 'charismatic, uh, then your guardrail', 'should be almost at the roof.

If', \"somebody's selling you something and\", \"they say you've got autoimmune disease\", \"or heart disease or cancer or you're\", 'feeling depressed, maybe you need more', \"of this thing that costs $100.

You're not just paritting\", 'data from a research paper with a with a', 'lab coat. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, the most', \"memorable DM I've ever received, this is\", 'back in 2021. Everyone had questions', 'about the COVID vaccine. So, I was', 'talking about that for 99% of live', 'stream. I come to the very end of it and', 'I say, \"I\\'ve got to go. My wife is', \"almost home from the hospital. I've got\", 'to go cook her dinner.\" And then I end', 'the live stream. Cool. And then all the', 'comments were about that.

I don't\", 'know if I can trust science until you', 'said the reason you were leaving was to', 'go cook dinner for your wife and I', \"realized like you're just a normal\", 'person. Right. Right. So, what is the', 'best strategy for viewers who want to', 'know rather than absorb information from', 'someone who is very entertaining and', 'very personable but may not be the right', 'source. Where do they go? Is it do your', 'own research? Have you done the', \"research? Neil's talked about it. You've\", 'got this confirmation bias.

And there are people who', 'spend a half hour in an afternoon', 'saying, \"I did the research. I did the', 'research.\" Yeah. Which could be', 'listening to a podcast. Right. Could be', 'watching a YouTube video. And so the', 'short answer is realistically I think', \"most people can't do their own research\", 'in the way that I would interpret doing', \"one's own research on a topic. And so\", \"what you're in fact half of graduate\", 'school is learning how to be a graduate', \"student, right? It's really it's complex\", 'not just to find the relevant research', 'papers, but to critically interpret', 'their study design and the results in', 'the context of the broader literature.', \"You're talking hundreds of hours of just\", 'time spent reading in a given topic', \"area. No one's going to do that.\", 'Certainly not after watching an', 'Instagram video and then questioning, is', 'this medically accurate?

I trust them to', 'come up with the right answer.

I think I think', \"that's a big part of it is really\", 'humanizing the process of how do we come', 'to these recommendations in the first', 'place and then do we trust your', 'recommendation because we know the', \"process you've gone through. People are\", 'never going to sit down and do 300 hours', 'worth of research on a topic. As someone', 'with a PhD in pharmarmacology and I will', 'mention immunology, explain the actual', 'science of how vaccines work and how the', 'body then goes to create the necessary', \"antibodies. It's actually the same\", \"process as when you're infected with a\", \"virus, right? And so it's the same\", \"answer for both. I'll answer from a\", 'vaccine standpoint. You get the', 'injection in your arm, right? What have', 'you just injected? Most often little', 'pieces of the pathogen. So what happens', 'in your arm tissue, pretty much nothing', \"right there. You've got one big immune\", 'cell that comes in and scoops it up. It', 'takes it to your draining lymph node is', \"what it's called. So it goes through\", 'this whole separate pathway in your', \"body. You've got your blood circulatory\", \"system. Most people don't know you\", 'actually have a separate almost', 'circulation system called lymph', 'lymphatic system. So the white blood', 'cells travel from wherever you got the', 'injection. It carries it back to a lymph', 'node and it starts showing it to all', 'these other immune cells and it says do', 'you recognize this? No. Do you recognize', \"this? No. Until it finds one. Oh, it's\", 'like a lineup. It is. And and the the', 'neat part is all of those cells that are', 'just sitting in your lymph node waiting', 'to be shown something they recognize.', \"They'll sit there like this. They\", 'exactly like the guy for the car at the', \"airport. If they don't recognize it,\", 'then what? Nothing happens. And then', 'they and the the one lymph node is just', 'like, \"Take your time. It\\'s okay.\"', 'Exactly. The immune cells getting tired', 'walking along.', 'But all of those cells were randomly', 'generated in advance. Right. So before', 'CO ever existed, you had in your body T-', 'cells and B cells that recognized COVID.', 'And then when you eventually got', 'infected for the first time or got your', 'vaccine, it was like their time to', 'shine. Basically, like, oh, hey, I know', 'that one. When that happens, that cell', 'gets activated. It multiplies,', 'multiplies, multiplies. It starts making', 'antibodies, right, that go back to your', 'site of infection. Go throughout your', 'whole body. It also activates TE-C', 'cells. So T- cells are the ones that', 'recognize, oh, that that friendly cell', 'is infected with a virus. I better kill', 'that cell. Have to kill that cell.', 'Right. Right. Exactly. So you get this', 'combination of antibodies that are', 'floating around to neutralize the virus', \"when it's in between cells and T-C cells\", 'to kill the ones that are incubating', 'virus actively. And that same process', \"happens whether you've been infected\", 'with a virus. it still takes the piece', 'of virus and goes to the lymph node and', \"activates the BNT cells. Here's\", 'something I never understood. Uh there', 'are people who had pretty serious side', 'effects to the COVID vaccine. Uh if the', 'vaccine is doing what CO itself would', 'have done, does that mean they would', 'have had those same side effects had', \"they gotten CO straight up? I don't\", \"think so. I don't know of data to say\", 'one way or the other. If the severity of', 'your vaccine response is predictive,', 'know the data one way guys honest', \"honest but boring. That's\", 'I can cope with that. No, I just want to', 'call out that when a scientist is', \"speaking and they're honest about their\", \"work and then all people say I don't\", \"know one way or another. That's honesty.\", \"I'd rather that right? Yeah. You could\", 'lie to us and be really confident and', 'then we do what you say. Yeah, man. If', 'you got a bad fever after the injection,', 'you would have died from CO.', \"Uh I don't know one way or the other. I\", \"my suspicion is that there's probably\", 'not much of a link between the two and', 'also that it would be very hard to test', 'because obviously once you are', 'vaccinated then when you get infected', \"it's going to be and by the way your\", \"infection if you do get it it's going to\", \"be lessened by the fact that you've been\", \"vaccinated right which so yeah it's uh\", \"it's like trying to get toothpaste back\", 'in the tube. Yeah. Yeah. Not happening.', \"Let's talk about the less extreme\", 'misunderstandings about vaccines', 'starting with can you have too many', 'vaccinations? Hm. The short answer is', 'no. There comes a point where if you', 'keep vaccinating against a certain', \"pathogen, you don't get additional\", \"benefit. There's actually really big\", 'results just published for HPV vaccines,', 'one dose versus two doses, the human', \"papilloma virus. That's right. The one\", 'that causes cervical cancer. Going from', 'one dose to two doses is not that much', 'better than one dose. But very important', 'to know that, right? Critically, but but', 'that has to be trials have to reveal', \"that otherwise you wouldn't know. Yeah.\", 'No, this is the result of decades of', 'clinical studies. Maybe to your question', 'though of in general like people talk', \"about oh my child's going to receive x\", 'number of vaccines over y number of', 'years to that one the answer is', 'definitely no. If you consider the total', \"number of pathogens we're exposed to on\", 'a daily basis. Think about your entire', \"gut. It's constantly being sampled for\", 'bacteria and viruses and everything and', 'then your immune system is secretting', 'antibodies into your gut to regulate', 'your gut microbiome. An additional one', 'or 10 pathogens from a vaccine is a drop', 'in the bucket compared to compared to', \"everything that's happening inside your\", 'body all the time. And by the way, I', 'cannot emphasize enough that the', 'comparison he gave is very common in', 'science. You can say, \"Will this harm', 'me?\" Right? And yeah, but look at the', \"all the other things you're doing and\", \"you're not worried about that harming\", 'you and those risks are 10 times as', \"high. Right. So it's not a harm. That's\", 'very important comparison to make and', \"it's a statistical comparison that I\", \"don't think people are comfortable or\", 'have experience doing. Yeah. Well,', 'because the the way they intuit it is', 'intuition is f is is false. They intuit', 'it wrongly because they say well if I', 'took this vaccine and this vaccine and', 'this vaccine and this vaccine all at the', 'same time my body must not be able to', 'handle that and that is what is causing', 'this disease or this condition or what', 'but the truth is your body is responding', \"to it because it's responding to that\", 'all the time. Yeah. And separately in', 'parallel, this goes back to the fact', \"there's all these cells sitting in your\", 'lift node waiting for their target,', 'right? Just because you activate this', 'one, this other one is still available', 'just waiting for its target. You can', 'activate both at the same time. At the', \"same time, they're doing they're doing\", \"different things. They're they're\", \"fighting different things. It's not like\", 'one is stepping on the other, right? You', \"know, they're both going it's like a\", 'five alarm fire. One fire station is', 'called, then a second fire station is', \"called. They don't cancel each other\", 'out. They help each other do their', 'thing. You know, one takes one part of', 'house, one takes another. So, yeah. All', 'right. Couple of other less extreme', 'misunderstandings to go through. Uh, can', 'you firstly overload the immune system', 'or can you boost the immune system? Oh,', \"great question. That's wow. You both\", 'cannot boost your immune system in the', \"ways you're thinking of, nor do I think\", 'it would be a good idea to boost your', 'immune system. You want balance your', 'immune system. Actually, if you get too', 'much immune activity, you know what? you', 'end up with autoimmune disease, right?', 'If you get too little immune activity in', 'your body, that increases your risk for', \"cancer, right? And so it's this balance\", 'between having just enough immune', 'activity to respond to acute infections', 'and stuff, but even if you could boost', 'your immunity by taking some supplement,', \"I don't know that you would want to do\", \"so, right? Um, there are certainly, it's\", 'funny because when we start out in life,', \"that's the whole idea is not to keep\", 'your child away. Just let them go, do', \"whatever because they're going to\", 'encounter these pathogens naturally and', \"then they're going their body, their\", 'immune system is going to develop', 'accordingly. Yeah, I should say there', 'are things you can do to reduce the', 'function of your immune system. So, you', \"don't want to be not getting enough\", 'sleep, right? I should say it in the way', 'that you should do it. You should get', 'high quality high double negative the', 'thing. Yeah, confusing myself. So, get', 'proper sleep. Sleep, nutrition, physical', 'activity, right? Low stress over time.', 'These things are boring. They do', 'meaningfully impact your immune', 'response. If you sleep deprive someone', 'before giving them a vaccine, you can', 'measure differences in the tighters', \"they're going to develop like in the\", 'days leading up to and after a vaccine.', \"But in the what that they're going to\", 'develop, uh like the the antibbody', 'responses to that vaccine will be worse', \"if you've sleep deprived them for the\", 'days leading up to it. Look at that. So,', 'the basic lifestyle stuff like is that', \"an experiment someone's conducted? It\", 'is. Yeah.', 'Volunteered for that. Exactly. So if', \"you're doing those every year and I took\", \"the vaccine. No. Got it. Yeah. If you're\", 'doing sort of the basic lifestyle stuff', 'that you know already for every other', \"disease on the planet. Um that's\", 'basically the extent of what you want to', 'do to be caring for your immune system.', \"It's also going to help you with\", 'everything else. Before we go on and', 'bring on my next guest, why is it that', 'some vaccines need to be boosted later', 'on?', \"Whereas whereas others don't. Great\", 'question. So So in other words, you can', 'be immune. You can be vaccinated for', 'life with one kind, but another one you', 'need you need a measles is like that. Is', 'that right? Yeah. If you got a measel', \"shot as a child back in the 60s, you're\", 'probably going to need a booster right', \"now. There's two levels of variability\", 'here. One is across different pathogens.', 'Mhm. Some pathogens are capsular and', \"it's harder to get longerlasting, you\", 'know, antibbody responses against what', 'you need to get responses against. You', 'just need to get boosted. Those', 'infections, if you get them, maybe you', 'get infections more recurrently with', 'rhino viruses or different corona', \"viruses. It's not like you get infected\", 'once in your life and then you never get', 'that pathogen again. Right. Over time,', 'maybe your immunity waines for whatever', \"reason. So there's differences across\", 'pathogens just based on their structure.', \"Oh, there's also big differences. When\", 'you say structure, you mean their', 'physical, how the molecules would ever', 'connect. Yeah. And how how that primes', 'your memory immune response to be either', 'longerlasting or not. Interesting. But', \"then there's also huge differences\", 'across people in the variability of both', 'the potency of your immune response and', 'the duration that it lasts. Okay? And', \"you can't tell based on how you feel.\", \"And so that there's two levels of\", 'variability there. Over a population, it', 'works great. But at any given person for', 'any given pathogen, you could see hugely', 'different persisting antibbody levels 20', '30 years after vaccination. I heard this', 'saying, no medicine is good for', 'anyone until it has been tested on', \"everyone. Wow. Yeah. So there's some\", 'truth to that, right? Absolutely. So So', \"you can't test it on everyone because\", 'you have sample sizes. But if you test', \"it on a thousand people and there's a\", 'one in a million reaction that someone', \"might have to it, you won't know that in\", 'that sample of a thousand, right? Which', 'is the whole value of doing post', 'marketing surveillance, uh, which is', 'done very surprisingly. Word', 'surveillance. Come on. Please best post', 'followup. Post marketing followup. Yes.', \"Where you've got these databases looking\", 'out for signals of potential risk. And', \"if one pops up, you know, that's\", 'probably anecdotal, but it serves as the', 'basis for a rigorous investigation that', 'you go do then afterwards. Got it. And', 'so tell me, and just to end it here,', 'tell me about the vaccine', 'adverse event reporting system. Adverse', 'effects reporting system. Theirs.', \"Theirs. Yeah. What is that? So it's\", 'exactly that type of monitoring system', \"where we've tested these vaccines in\", 'this number of people. It looks good in', \"that number of people. we're not going\", 'to test it in 300 million people before', 'we release it. So you release it and', \"you're getting safety signals if the\", 'same thing starts to pop up over time.', 'You say, \"Well, we should go do a formal', \"study and look if that's actually\", 'associated with the vaccine.\" Gives you', 'an excuse to focus in, right? For things', 'that could be very rare that you would', 'never see in a typical clin clinical', 'trial, even if you had 10,000 20,000', 'people in the clinical study because', \"it's one in a million or one in 10\", \"million, right? And so there's some\", 'noise because these things are', 'voluntarily reported and sometimes', \"things do happen by coincidence. That's\", 'what the V stands for. Volunteer. Look', 'at that. No, no. V stands for vaccine.', 'Yeah. Vaccine adverse event reporting', 'system. So this relies entirely on', 'someone knowing it exists, logging on', 'and typing in some effect, right?', \"Adverse effect. It's often healthcare\", \"providers who will log it. They'll say\", 'the person got this vaccine. Oh, good.', \"So there's a professional in the loop.\", 'Correct. Very good to know that.

People will\", 'say, \"Look how many reports there were', 'in the system.\" But of course, what', 'happens if you vaccinate 30 million', 'children? Some of those children are', 'going to have other things happen to', 'them that are', 'unrelated that might be related or they', \"may not. There's the some rare other\", \"thing that it's time coincident with and\", \"there's not a cause and effect. Right.\", \"And so it's critical to have to identify\", \"when there are true signals. You can't\", 'rely on it to show that vaccines are', 'dangerous for XYZ, right? Yes.', \"Interesting. Tell me if I'm wrong here.\", 'When the COVID', \"vaccine arrived and it wasn't yet enough\", 'for everybody, so they did first', 'responders and then teachers. I think', 'that roll out felt sensible to me.', 'All of us who remembered things like the', 'polio vaccine and the smallox vaccine', 'fully expected that once you got that', 'vaccine you would never get co again.', 'But that is not what happened.', \"And then well there's a new strain and\", \"there's new this and then people got it\", 'twice. Some people got the same strain', 'twice. So it seems to me that fact', \"undermines certain people's confidence.\", 'Yeah. that that was either the right', 'vaccine or an appropriate vaccine or', 'whether people even knew what they were', \"talking about. We all know people who've\", 'had COVID three four times. I I was no', 'vid until like 3 months ago I would say.', 'Yeah. So I think this is a misalignment', 'of expectations versus reality. We know', 'looking at other corona viruses because', 'there are seasonal corona viruses that', 'mostly now cause the common cold. People', 'get reinfected all the time. Yeah. And', \"so there's every reason to expect with a\", 'new corona virus you have immunity now.', \"That doesn't totally preclude you from\", 'infection later. Yeah. But if I had', 'small pox, I expect no small pox. Right.', \"And so there's huge variability across\", 'different pathogens. Nobody told us that', 'when the vaccine came out. Exactly. So I', \"think that's the shortfalling of\", 'communication. Did they know that that', 'was something they could have', 'communicated at the time or was it still', 'on the frontier of learning of the', 'progress of the novelty of the virus?', \"There's a big part of that too is being\", \"honest and we don't know for sure yet.\", 'This is a new virus right now if you get', \"the vaccine, you're not going to get\", \"infected or it's a 95% reduction in\", 'risk. Uh or your risk of severe disease', 'is reduced by 90%. But how that will', \"change 3 years from now, you can't be\", 'totally certain. If they knew that, they', 'needed to be honest about it, I think.', \"Yeah. Because that's how science works.\", 'You know what you know at any given time', 'and you give the best available', 'information. So, uh, we want everyone to', \"watch your postings. Dr. Knock. That's\", \"right. Dr. Knock. That's right. Dr. And\", \"that's on Tik Tok. And are you call that\", 'also on Instagram? Tik Tok. Instagram.', 'Yep. Same name. Excellent.

When\", 'we come back, Scott Hamilton Kennedy', 'will tell us about his film, his', 'documentary Shot in the', 'Arm on the subject of medical', \"misinformation. We can't call that topic\", 'complete without venturing into the', 'world of vaccine', 'hesitancy, vaccines in general. And', \"there's one person who's at the front of\", \"that conversation, and it's my friend\", 'Scott Hamilton Kennedy. Scott, welcome', 'to Star Talk. Good to see you, Neil.', \"Hey, dude. You're a filmmaker. I am a\", 'filmmaker. Storyteller. A documentary', 'filmmaker. Yeah. Storyteller. Because', 'not all documentaries tell stories. They', \"try. They're just informational. They\", 'can be a little laundry listy. Yeah.', \"When you're laundry list, it it's less\", 'compelling, I find. Agre. Agreed.', \"Because you know deeply, I'm guessing\", 'that people love to have stories told to', \"them. And why? Yeah. What's the origin\", \"of that? I would say you've all hari\", 'said it so beautifully in his book', 'sapiens that he said that storytelling', 'is the best tool we have available to us', 'as human beings to get along to agree to', 'change things he really put it into such', 'an amazing context that it is the art of', 'storytelling that we can use to convince', 'each other to make this world a more', 'functioning place. So, you made a film', 'called Shot in the Arm, which I actually', 'had something to do with. You invited me', 'as a script consultant. Not that I am an', 'expert on vaccines, but that I do think', 'deeply about how people learn science', 'and what may convince them one way or', 'another. So, thank you for inviting me.', 'I would call you my mentor, sir, if I', 'can. Uh, so where did that film come', \"from in your head? Yeah. So, uh, I'll go\", 'all the way back to 2018. I was talking', 'to a wonderful doctor uh Dr. John Were', 'viruses invented in 2018 yet', 'in 2018. Well, you know Dr. John', 'Schwarzber because we got to do another', 'film together called food evolution.', 'That was a reset of the conversation on', 'GMOs. And Dr. John Schwarzber runs the', 'Berkeley Wellness Letter, this fantastic', 'letter out of Cal Berkeley that has', 'doctors vet scientific information and', 'then bring it back to the public in a', 'consumable way, not consumer. When you', 'say doctors vet the scientific', 'information, it means they read the', 'journals and bring journal information.', \"That's right. To the people. That's\", \"right. So the people don't have to read\", \"the journals. That's right. They're\", \"interpreted. It It's wonderful. It's\", 'such a simple, beautiful and very much', \"of your world, too. Right. That you're a\", 'wonderful translator in a way of', 'complicated science. And he said to me,', \"um, Scott, what's your next movie going\", 'to be on? You should take on these', 'antivaxers. This is fall 2018. And in my', 'wisdom, I said, um, oh no, why would I', \"need to touch them? They're going to go\", \"away. They're going to burn out. Genius\", 'as always. Cut to spring 2019.', 'Record-breaking measles outbreak. A', 'state of emergency here in New York City', 'in the Orthodox Jewish community or', 'measles. Measles outbreak after it had', 'been declared defeated. We were on the', 'road to eliminating it in 2000. We were', 'World Health Organization. Did they make', \"these declarations? That's right. That's\", 'my lazy research I did when this when I', 'saw the state of emergency in New York', 'City is I did a little research and I', \"saw that we're about to eliminate it\", '2000. So, what the heck is going on', 'here? Why would we have a state of', \"emergency if we're so close? And I\", \"called Dr. Paul Offett, who's a big part\", 'of the upsh shot in the arm. And he', 'said, \"Scott, it\\'s not very complicated,', 'but it is nefarious that there are', 'people out there that have become to be', 'known as antivaxers who scare and', 'convince parents to not vaccinate their', \"children.

It can stay in a', \"room. I think it's 2 hours after\", 'floating in the air. Floating in the', \"air. Yeah. That it's that contagious. So\", 'that I thought was enough to begin a', 'movie. And so I began this movie in', '2019. My first day shooting was at the', \"CDC's ASIP meetings where they confirm\", 'the next vaccines that are coming out.', 'And I had Paul Offett there and I had', 'one of the top antivaxers there, Dell', 'Bigree, who went on to be a dear friend', \"of Robert Kenny Jr.'s went on to be\", \"Robert Kenny Jr.'s uh communications\", 'director during his presidential run,', \"but we'll come back to that.

So', 'we thought we had a pretty important', 'movie in all of those elements and then', 'co happened and it went to another place', 'where we had to film from lockdown. I', 'included my family a little bit as like', 'the all of us and uh for a minute we', 'thought the anties might god forbid go', 'away when you have a once in a century', 'pandemic but they got stronger and more', 'nefarious.', 'How does someone judge in your cinematic', 'world whether or not your film is', 'propaganda? Great. Vet it, right? Vet', 'it. Go vet it. Yeah. Look look at the', 'experts that I have in the film. Look at', 'the scientific studies that we point out', 'in the film. We put we put them right up', 'on the screen and we have them on our', 'website and all those all. And I will', 'add the experts you do interview,', \"they're not saying listen to me because\", 'I alone have this one answer. Correct.', \"They're representing a scientific\", 'medical establishment. Correct. Right.', 'And and at some point we have to reclaim', 'the importance of the word', \"establishment. Yeah. It's become a bad\", 'word. Are you from the establishment?', \"That's right. Oh, that's bad. Yeah. No,\", \"there's a reason why an establishment\", \"exists. That Yeah, it's the level of\", 'cynicism is very very depressing. But to', 'back to your point, your question about', \"the film, vet the film. Don't take my\", \"word for it. Don't take the fact that I\", 'have the wonderful Neil Degrasse Tyson', 'as my executive producer, which is a a', 'great honor and should make them say,', '\"Hey, if Neil vetted it, that should', 'mean something.\" That\\'s fine. But vet', 'the film and vet the words coming out of', 'the people we refer to as anti in the', 'film. It it is true that most propaganda', \"films don't invite you to vet it. That's\", 'right. But again that goes back to my', \"I'm trying to wrap it up but but the\", 'tools that we could have on Star Talks', 'website on Black Valley Films website on', 'Shot in the Arms website that Black', \"Valley Films is your production. It's my\", 'production. Thank you. Is that says here', 'are the tools we use for vetting. Right.', \"They're right there. here are the tools\", \"we use for vetting and it's transparent.\", 'So it needs to be more and say hey you', 'trying to poke a hole in me do you have', 'those tools on your website? Yeah.', 'Right. So that empowers people to', 'verify. Yeah. In some way or another. So', 'Scott, what does your film shot in the', 'arm have to say about our responsibility', \"to each other because that's seems to be\", 'deeper than just any conversation about', \"medicine, right? It's a it's a social\", 'contract contract. Tell me about that.', \"Yeah. Um, no, it's a great it's a great\", 'point that uh this social contract', 'became part of the film through um a few', 'different characters in the film that', \"reminded me of it. I don't remember the\", 'last time I probably talked about it', 'outside of making this film. Was it in', 'grade school or something? So, civics', 'class. Yeah. A simple definition of the', 'social contract are these norms that are', 'written or sometimes not written that', \"have become norms. Don't drink and\", 'drive. Take out your trash. Be a decent', 'neighbor. be a good citizen in your', \"community, don't harm your children,\", 'feed your children, all these different', 'things. And vaccines could be is part of', \"that, right? That you don't necessarily\", 'get a vaccine. You do get a vaccine to', 'keep yourself safe, but sometimes you', \"don't get a vaccine necessarily for you\", 'to stay safe. You get a vaccine so you', \"don't pass something on to somebody\", \"who's more vulnerable than you. And\", 'sadly during CO we saw it was building', 'up long before CO but during CO we', 'really saw kind of a bit of a disaster', 'around our social contract that people', 'leaned into what they would call freedom', \"but it's really a version of\", \"selfishness. I'm sorry to say it's a\", 'tough word but wait so you explored in', 'the film that the original sort of', 'antivaxers was a community deeply', 'embedded in liberal voting factions. Y', 'and only under co was there a right', 'leaning faction that were not so much', 'anti-farma which is the common battlecry', 'in the left but they were just pro-', 'freedom right and so their notion was', \"you can't inject me if I don't want you\", \"to. That's right. So why don't we just\", 'still allow that but then deny them', 'access to places where they could spread', 'the disease or we could give them their', 'own', \"island. It's hor it's terribly cynical\", 'and maybe even mean. But if we had an', 'island, all these people say, \"I want my', \"freedoms. Don't tell me what drugs to\", \"take. Don't touch my food. Um I don't\", \"want my milk to be pasteurized. I don't\", 'want fluoride in my water.\" Okay, fine.', \"Here's the island. You guys go start\", 'over again. I think somebody may have', 'written a book that may have touched on', 'this but not everything in that list is', 'equal course. So for example if your', 'water supply your personal water supply', 'you remove the fluoride right no one', 'else is affected by that. True. But if', 'you are not vaccinated and you catch the', 'disease and you infect others then they', 'are affected. Correct. Okay. So not all', 'the reasons why you might ship people to', 'this island are equivalent. No, I just', \"want to ship the ones I don't like. I'm\", \"not I didn't say that this was I didn't\", 'say this was a kind decision, Neil. This', 'is a frustrated This is a decision.', \"Okay. So, there's been a failure on the\", \"civics front and that's what you're\", 'really getting at and individual', 'individual front that we did. We did we', \"remember that there's a thing called the\", 'social contract. Do we want No, I never', 'learned it about it that way. But in', 'fifth grade, I did have civics class. I', \"don't think I even had civics class.\", 'Yeah, I had a civics club. I had a', 'button called you were in the civics', 'club. Nice. And I might still have that', 'button actually. And we did things like', 'we held elections and campaigning.', 'People be ran for president of the class', 'and things that were microcosms of the', \"larger society. Yeah. We didn't pretend\", 'someone had been vaccinated or had a', 'disease, but but it forced you to think', \"about other people. That's it. And maybe\", 'that was undervalued in the kindergarten', 'through 12 curriculum. It might be', 'another one of those things that we took', 'for granted in a bad way that we took', 'for granted that we have these systems', 'and maybe our kinder people in our', 'family were making those systems work.', 'If it was our grandparents who were', 'teaching us to be polite or whatever the', 'different things were, right? So, how do', 'we fix it? Again, this is the not', \"quickly. Let's start there. Not quickly.\", 'Um, the quick part would be to say, is', 'there a problem? I might make a', 'comparison to', 'uh alcohol and and addiction, right? We', 'may we probably all have some family', 'member that has been addicted to', 'something like alcohol or a drug and we', 'wanted to help them and we might want to', \"say stop. It's not going to work. What's\", \"the first step that's going to get them\", 'to actually go down the road admitting', \"their addiction? So I think we're living\", 'through a time where people are not in', 'the place to admit that they might have', 'a problem about being cynical about', 'science. They might have a problem about', 'humility. They might have a problem with', 'their relationship to the social', 'contract. And we have to admit that', \"problem. Yeah. If you're an alcoholic,\", 'you might go into therapy. Do you go', \"into therapy if you're not admitting\", 'that science matters in your life? But', \"you usually don't you usually don't go\", \"to therapy unless you've until you've\", \"admitted it. You don't go to dry out.\", \"You don't Yeah. You you you might have\", 'an intervention, but besides the', \"intervention, it's you the first step\", \"has to be and it's still even within\", 'intervention. They can leave the uh the', 'drug rehab place, right? They have to', 'admit that they have a problem. So, can', 'we as a society admit that we have a', 'problem about cynicism, that we have a', 'problem about selfishness, that we have', 'a problem about what is expertise and', 'who we should be listening to? That I', \"think is Yeah. But you're the filmmaker\", \"and there's nothing more influential in\", 'American society than a well-made film', 'that everyone sees and is deeply uh', 'affecting them. Did you just take us in', 'a time machine prior to social media?', 'Yeah,', 'I would agree with that statement except', \"for and I love films. They've been in\", 'you know after the movie Ghost with you', 'know Whoopy Goldberg and and Demi Moore', 'and Demi Moore. Yeah. After that film', \"polls on people's belief in ghost went\", 'up. There you go. Just because of the', 'film. Yeah. that they somehow made it', 'more real because it was a story well', \"told without question. And so so I'm\", \"just a scientist and you're the\", \"storyteller. You're you're the\", 'timehonored storyteller. Yeah. Whose', 'craft predates science. Nice. Nice.', 'Beautiful. The storytelling predates', 'science. Yes. And I am an independent', \"documentary filmmaker. So that's\", 'documentary filmmaker and independent', \"means that I'm a little bit on the\", 'outside.', 'What do you do if someone notices in', 'your funding stream that you get money', 'from like the enemy? You get money from', \"pharma and you're trying to say that\", 'farmer is good. Sure. I do everything in', 'my power to not take money from a', 'conflict of interest in the making of', 'the film in the distribution of the', \"film. I don't care who gives me money\", \"because I I finish the film and it's\", \"locked and it's hasn't it hasn't been\", \"influenced. So yeah, but that's another\", 'just because there is a possible', \"conflict of interest doesn't mean there\", 'is a conflict of interest. There is', \"people have come to assume it. That's\", 'right. So Scott, we previously', 'collaborated on a film food evolution,', 'which explored misinformation regarding', 'genetically modified organisms, GMOs.', \"And in both of these films, you're\", 'exploring things that in the', 'left-leaning community', 'Some of them are hold sacred and you are', 'dismantling some of their beliefs within', 'this. And you had a phrase and I never', 'remember it exactly. What was it? The', 'limitation of well-intentioned liberals.', 'The limitations of well-intentioned', \"liberals. Yeah. Where it's an idea that\", 'wants to be they want to promote then', \"they overstep. That's right. In what\", 'they think is true regarding the idea.', \"That's right. And but they think they're\", 'right. Yeah. But confirmation bias', 'rabbit hole. Okay. Yeah. And so this has', \"been your this is your thing. It's a\", 'piece of the pie. It was different prior', 'to COVID because now then everything', 'blew up and and there was all sorts of', 'people with their limitations of of of', 'good intentions. But yes, I as a born', 'and raised diehard liberal, I came to', 'question my liberal brothers and sisters', 'through that through that lens that it', \"isn't just good intentions are not\", \"enough. You've got to have data. You\", 'have to have evidence. You have to have', 'repeatability. You have to check', \"yourself every so often. So, yes, it's a\", 'Yeah, my point was that often the', 'liberal left will declare that the', 'conservative right is anti-science,', \"right? And and they'll cite very obvious\", 'examples such as denial of climate', 'change and in some cases denial of', 'evolution. But the the statement is made', \"as though they're up on high looking\", 'down looking down. Whereas you part the', 'curtains in the liberal community, you', 'get things like homeopathic medicines,', 'you get crystal healing, feather energy,', 'you get these things. The only way you', 'can embrace these ideas and philosophies', 'is to reject', '[Music]', 'the science that either comes from part', 'or all of mainstream science that denies', \"it. That's right. And so that puts you\", 'in a weird place as a storyteller. You', 'did a beautiful thing on the poster for', 'food evolution and you signed it saying', \"to Scott who's not afraid of what is\", 'true. Did I say that? Yeah. Okay. I may', 'have forged it. Yeah. And I thought it', 'was such a It took me a little while', 'actually, Neil, to come back to it and', 'go, \"Oh, that\\'s what that means.\" Cuz', \"I'm not afraid of what is true, right?\", \"I'm afraid of what's been manipulated.\", \"Yeah. There's a group think thing that\", \"you don't even know you're in a group\", 'think or somebody lying to me, right? I', \"Somebody tells me the truth, I'm going\", 'to deal with the truth, right? Somebody', \"tells me something that's Can you handle\", \"the truth? That's right. Somebody tell\", \"me tells me something that's scary and\", \"it's not true. Oh my god, it's a\", 'disaster, right? Let the the truth is', 'complicated enough, but I to go to get', 'back to like why I joked earlier about', 'could we have a beeper on our phone that', 'says full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] full of', '[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right?

So, I don't teach right now,\", \"but in a couple years, I'll be teaching\", \"science communication courses. So, we're\", 'going to build a science communication', 'minor and hopefully turn it into a', 'major. So,', 'good. Will this be in collaboration with', 'the communications department a little', \"bit? So it's a partnership journalism\", 'department. Yes. So the art the arts and', 'letters program. So both of our colleges', \"are going to come together and so we'll\", 'take their expertise and the actual', 'communication our expertise with science', 'and kind of blend it together. And I', \"think it's going to be so badly\", 'journalism is so broken and science', 'might be a way to sort of stitch that a', 'force to help stitch it back together.', \"Well, you know, I'm not even sure if\", 'journalism is as broken as we think. I I', 'believe that people have siloed to an', \"extent where they can't accept whatever\", 'journalistic uh point of view is being', \"put forward cuz they can't think crit\", 'critically. So they could just go what', \"the hell man that's not cool what you\", 'just said there because you know uh I', \"don't agree with you and that that\", 'becomes the whole argument. Well you', 'need somebody to fix that right you know', 'but I think science is a way of of of', 'actually bridging the gap. Yeah, because', 'when people learn how science works as a', 'way of thinking, it changes their entire', 'life%. So if you got the journalism', 'department involved, very good. And they', 'So are you teaching scientists to be', 'better communicators or journalists to', \"be better scientists? Both. That that's\", 'clutch, right? We have to do both of', \"these. That's amazing. So for the\", 'scientist, excuse me, did that word get', 'bring come into being?', 'That is I thought it was so fetch, but', \"I'm just getting past fetch. It's\", \"important. It's so clutch. I love it.\", \"All right. It's necessary. We have to\", 'teach the scientists how to communicate,', 'right? And that could be a number of', 'different mediums like podcasts, books,', 'written, right? Journalism because', \"because in the science degrees don't\", \"care about that. They don't. We're not\", 'trained in talking to the public in any', \"medium. We're really not. We're taught\", \"to talk to each other, right? And we're\", 'taught to write in in passive voice,', \"which I don't know if you've ever read\", \"passive voice. It's boring. It's super\", \"boring. So, if you're trying to connect\", 'with the non-scientist, passive voice is', 'not the answer, right? You know, but', 'both are necessary that to be able to', 'talk to scientists but then be able to', \"translate to the lay person is what's\", 'really important. And for some reason', \"it's I don't know how can I put it. Um I\", \"I I don't want to say that it's that\", \"it's counter to the way scientists are\", 'as people. Like my son is right now', 'studying to become a molecular', 'biologist. Nice. Okay. When did that', \"happen? You didn't tell me that. Yeah.\", \"That's what he decided, you know, and he\", 'got a full ride. Yes. You was a father', 'and he wants to be in molecular biology.', \"How'd that happen? That's why he wants\", 'to be in it. He looked at my life and', 'was like, \"Oh, no. I I I need something', 'to get Let me tell you something. Comedy', 'is not the way to go.\" But I told him, I', 'was like, \"Dude, that\\'s great.

I don\\'t want to', \"talk I don't I don't want to talk to\", 'people about it. I just want to do it.', 'And I think a lot of scientists feel', 'that way. Yeah. I just want to go in the', \"lab. I just want to do it. I don't want\", 'to talk about it. Yeah. Shut up and get', 'back to the lab. Exactly. Right. Well, I', 'mean, as scientists, we have three', 'categories. The first thing we do is we', 'ask a question. The middle thing we do', 'is we seek the answer. We do our', 'research. And then the last thing is', 'actually sharing it with the public.

And you also have to', 'have a thick skin. People will come', 'after you for what you say. Yeah. Yeah.', 'Yeah. Yeah. So, so what what we are here', 'in my office at at the Hayden', 'Planetarium. What brings you to New', \"York? Oh, I'm here for a spot on the\", 'Today Show', \"and so so we're just like it we just\", 'squeezed us in to the', 'We are a straight up booty call.', 'You answered.

I think that was kind of the', \"question. It's different, right? So the\", \"Today show you're talking to a certain\", \"audience. It's the American public,\", \"right? And they're usually people who\", \"aren't necessarily signing up for a\", 'science lesson.', 'Nice idea. You just called our audience', \"smart. They they are smart. They're\", \"science enthusiasts, right? Wouldn't you\", 'say so? No. No. No. So, no. Very', 'important point here. We already know', \"our audience and it's a science\", \"audience.

Yeah, they all know you. So,', 'yeah. So, just a couple of fast ones', 'here. When you were a kid, did you like', 'burn holes in the carpet and and and', 'explode the kitchen? Like science,', 'mommy? What What What kind of were you', 'like girl nerd where this is I got to do', 'this? Yes and no. U so I was more of an', 'athlete. I was a soccer player. So, that', 'was the true love. I was a very uh one', 'who asked a lot of questions. So, my', 'parents would count the number of', 'questions I would ask in a car ride cuz', 'it drive them nuts. Um my mom was more a', 'helicopter mom, so there was no', \"blowtorrch anywhere near me. There's no\", 'chance I would have ever been able to', 'set something on fire. Wow. Wow. Okay.', 'But I could see this in a sitcom. the', 'over curious kid just and mommy daddy', 'how about daddy and then the car and', \"then the next scene you're just out on\", 'the street', \"going just leave you I'm sure they\", 'thought about that I am positive more', 'more kindly they drop you at a museum', 'somewhere and then they keep driving on', \"yes that's perfect okay but so how did\", \"if she's a helicopter mom what freedoms\", 'were did you still have to express', 'yourself okay so this is where I really', 'appreciate what she did when I was', 'younger so she made one bathroom safe', 'like there were no chemicals like you', 'know like cleaning chemicals, I should', 'say. But there was food coloring, there', 'was shampoo, bath soap, uh bubble bath,', \"stuff that can't kill you. Stuff that\", \"can't kill you. Put it in this.

Very recently, I had something', \"go wrong. I just made that up. You're\", 'saying that actually happened? It Oh, it', 'happens all the time. I did this one', 'experiment where I intentionally cover', 'myself in soapy green bubbles. Um, and', 'it comes right off in the shower. Just', \"two face washes. You're good. Okay. All\", \"right. I ain't doing that.\", \"I am. You are. I'm willing to. That's\", 'why you are Kate the chemist. Yes,', \"that's right. I like it. So, Chuck, give\", 'us give us some of our cosmic curiosity.', \"Let's get right to it then, shall we?\", 'This is Shawn Browning and he says,', '\"Hello, this is Shawn Browning. I\\'m', 'coming from Hood River, Oregon.\" Hood', 'River. Yeah. Why does seesium have such', 'a violent reaction when exposed to', 'oxygen? And what are some of its', 'practical uses that the average person', 'would not know about? Okay, in the', 'periodic table, the periodic table is', 'kind of shaped like a U. And so cesium', 'is in the bottom left hand corner. And', 'so the bottom left hand corner is where', 'your biggest atoms are. And so cesium is', 'really big. And what that means is it', 'has a very very positively charged core.', 'its nucleus, but its electrons are very', 'far away. So, it can barely reach the', \"electrons. And so, because it's so big\", 'and their charges are so separated,', 'oxygen, which likes to take electrons', 'from a neighbor, it is exactly it loves', 'to steal electrons. It will steal the', \"electrons. That's a book title, the\", 'electron. The electron thief. I like', \"that. That's your next book. Okay. We'll\", 'write together.', \"Yeah. So, it's so it's so big. And so\", \"that's oxygen can come in, grab the\", 'electrons, and the electrons gladly jump', \"to oxygen because it's much much smaller\", 'and it can eas', 'I can see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There it', 'is. There it is. Okay. So,', 'so now it reaches for oxygen. What is', 'the result of that chemical reaction? Is', 'it exothermic? Endothermic what?', 'Probably exothermic would be my guess.', 'It really depends on the situation and', 'like where their energy levels are. It', 'will form an ionic salt and so it either', 'forms seesium oxide or cesium super', 'oxide. So just either two cesiums and', 'one oxygen or two oxygen and one cesium.', 'Um and it forms these two two products', 'and there that in itself is quite', 'stable. The oxides usually are. Okay. So', 'what does it look what does this because', 'he said violent what does this violent', \"reaction look like? So my guess is he's\", 'thinking about when you throw these', \"group one metals into water. So we've\", \"seen this with sodium before if you've\", 'googled that. Love me some sodium and', 'water. Oh my gosh. So sodium you can cut', \"it with a knife. It's a metal. Cut it\", 'with a knife. Toss in water. It', 'basically blows up essentially', \"definitely. But it's but that's reacting\", 'with water. It is. Or is it the', \"dissolved oxygen that it's reacting\", \"with? It's the same process is\", \"happening. It's the electrons being\", 'pulled from the group one metal. Got it.', \"All right. Yeah. And then it's a it's an\", 'exothermic process like you said. So', 'that will throw it in water. Mhm. So the', 'other part of the questions you asked', 'about like what are some things that', 'people might not know about cesium and', 'so a cesium 133 I think is used for an', 'atomic clock and so what happens is you', 'basically disturb these atoms they give', 'off a frequency and you can use that', 'frequency to to measure time and how how', \"are you exciting the atoms so that it's\", \"a disturbance so usually it's like a\", 'push you want to get it to vibrate and', \"so it's just you just have to move it a\", 'little bit and that frequency is then', 'mapped out to keep track of time and', \"it's so So is it so consistent that it's\", 'you can easily use it like you can set a', 'clock by it.', 'Exactly. In fact the duration of the', 'second is defined by how many cycles of', 'the cium atom. Okay. So how many', 'vibrations do you get in a second with', \"cesium? It's like nine decimal places.\", \"I'm sorry. Oh. So it's that that's why\", \"it's an atomic clock and it's why it's\", 'very precise, right? Because if you got', \"nine decimal places in 1 second, that's\", \"pretty damn accurate. Yeah. You you're\", 'good for all time. No pun intended.', 'What? Chuck, stop it.', \"He's on a roll. He's on a roll. You want\", 'to know how precise this is, right? For', 'that vibration, for the vibration the', 'chemist tells us about it is 9', 'bill192,631,770 cycles of that', 'vibration. So that vibration is the', 'exact definition of a second. Of a', \"second. Yes. There you go. That's cool.\", 'And if I can add to that, if I may,', 'until that was defined with that', 'precision, the second was a predefined', 'fraction of the year 1900. Okay? And so', \"that involved Earth's rotation around\", 'thing, the rotation of the earth was', 'built into the definition of the second.', \"Why wouldn't it be? Because there\", '60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes, an', \"hour. Okay? Why wouldn't it be? Why\", \"wouldn't But that meant if Earth were\", 'slowing down or speeding up, right?', \"There'd be no way to know that. Exactly.\", \"Because the mechanism that's giving you\", 'the second is changing. So you offload', 'it onto your CCM atom. Now we say, \"Yo,', 'Earth, what? What?\" And so since we', \"don't need you, Earth, we totally don't\", \"need. Not only that, you're acting up.\", \"So since 19 plus you're slowing down\", \"anyway. Since 1972, we've had to add 20\", 'some 57 leap seconds, right? just to', \"account for Earth slowing down. It's all\", 'because of your cesium, Adam. Look at', 'that. My cesium. I love it. I love it. I', \"don't know any other uses, though. Is\", \"there? Not really. I mean, I'm sure\", \"there's other ones. Uh I mean, let's be\", \"honest. That's enough.

I'm glad to know\", \"that it's there. Yeah. Uh, he says,\", '\"Most gracious, thanks for using my', 'question. You probably had this question', \"a billion times, but I've never heard an\", 'answer to it.\" So, here it is. We\\'ve all', 'heard by now that the Mentos and Diet', \"Coke thing. Okay, cool. One, what's the\", 'history and who thought of that? and', 'two, what causes the chemical reaction', 'that everybody puts on YouTube to make', 'the video. Yes, the soda geyser. Okay,', 'so that went back to about 1910. It was', 'originally done with those winter green', \"lifesavers. Say we didn't have Mentos in\", \"1910. We didn't. No, we didn't. So, it\", 'was originally done with the winter life', 'winter green lifesavers green. I', 'remember that. Oh, apostrophe green.', 'Savers are that old. They are. Yeah,', 'there are. And so they go into the soda', 'like a soda pop, right? And so it had', 'that little hole in the center and so it', 'would make this really neat geyser and', 'it would come out. But then through the', 'hole in the middle of the of the', 'lifesaver. Yep. But then in the 1990s,', 'the lifesaver company changed the size', 'of the lifesaver. The science teachers', 'were upset and they said, \"All right,', 'throw this experiment to the students.', \"Let's figure out how to replicate this\", \"now that the lifesaver doesn't fit in\", 'there.\" They did a science some', 'committed chemist right. Awesome though.', 'I can totally see high school teachers', 'just grabbing their students and', 'grabbing all the candy, all the soda,', 'and say, \"All right, figure out what is', 'experiment.\" Exactly. So, what\\'s special', 'about the surface of a mentos cuz it', \"doesn't have a hole in it, right? And if\", \"I remember correctly, there's they're\", \"they're solid candies, right? It's solid\", 'candy, but it has these nucleation', 'sites, these like little divots, and', 'they attract on the surface. And so, it', 'attracts the carbon dioxide in the soda.', 'The carbon dioxide slams into each', 'other, builds up pressure, and it just', 'shoots out the top. And then they found', 'that diet coke has the best reaction cuz', 'it has the highest carbonation. Okay. I', \"thought, however, that that's not why\", 'they use diet coke. Oh, please tell me', \"then if it's otherwise. Okay. I didn't\", \"think that was why. There's part So, one\", \"part is that it doesn't have the sugar\", \"and so it's not as big of a mess for\", \"it's a mess, right? Diet Coke you just\", 'hose up. But sugar then it the the Coke', 'evaporates and everything is gummed up.', 'I thought that was the main reason. It', 'is one of the main reasons. But if you', \"are on a flight, I don't know if you fly\", 'commercial still, but if you are on a', \"flight, what are you? Excuse me. I'm on\", 'a subway to get', \"here. Commercial fancy. I don't know\", \"what you're doing commercial. Okay, for\", 'the rest of us, when we have a flight', 'attendant go down in a plane, watch', 'them. When somebody orders Diet Coke,', 'just watch how they pour it. It takes', 'way longer for all that carbonation to', 'sink and for them to top it off. So you', 'can actually watch it happen right on a', 'plane ride compared to a non diet like a', 'like a Mountain Dew or a Coke or', 'anything. It just has that experiment', 'that plus at the lower pressure in a', \"plane there's there's less to press down\", \"on the CO2 anyway so that there's more\", \"bubbling action regardless. Yeah, that's\", 'a good point. I will check that out.', 'Okay, please do. Please do. All right.', 'So that means if I have a a a soda maker', 'machine, a carbonator, whatever those', 'machines are called, if I cuz I have I', 'do own one, but I have there are three', \"settings. There's low, medium, and high.\", 'If I go to high and then repeat that', \"three times, that's the liquid you want\", \"probably for your experiment. I'm also\", 'going to blow apart your kitchen.', 'You just made a bomb.', 'Thank you for saying that. Okay, next.', \"Andy here from Thousand Oaks. I've heard\", 'the human nose is an incredible chemical', 'sensor that not only detects very faint', 'traces of a molecule, but also tens of', 'thousands of types of molecules. My', 'question is, do you use this fact in the', 'science of chemistry to aid in your work', 'in any way? Or do you generally avoid', 'smelling experiments due to unknown', 'noxious effects? I love that. Remind me', 'because chemistry for me was a long time', \"ago. You don't actually stick your\", 'nostril on top of the the test tube', '100%. So, but there is', 'this thing so that can dilute it to a', 'level that you can know whether you', 'should get closer. Exactly. Yes. So, the', 'rule number one is do not eat anything', 'or smell anything or drink anything in', 'lab. Rule number two is okay, we know', \"you're going to smell it, so let me\", \"teach you how to do it safely. Yep. It's\", \"wafting. You're pushing the molecules\", 'towards you. If some of the molecules,', 'yes, some a small portion of them. Um,', 'but I think part of the question is', 'asking like, \"Do you ever do this and do', 'you ever use your nose?\" I did something', 'just recently where I had to do this', 'where people helped me by bringing two', 'beers out to my my performance stage,', 'basically my stage table, and they', \"weren't labeled. One had water, one had\", 'vinegar, and I immediately just stuck my', 'nose right in there because we can tell', 'the difference between it, and then I', 'was able to do the experiment without', 'any doubt or anything. But you use it,', 'you use your nose to protect yourself.', \"It's a way for us to know whether or not\", 'chicken is bad or good or anything like', 'that. So, it is a tool that you can use', \"if you're safe about it in the chemistry\", 'lab. Is there anything that smells good', \"that will also kill you?

I am sure there', 'is something that smells good that will', \"kill us. I can't think of anything off\", 'the top of my head right now. Do you', 'have one in mind? No, but I have the', 'opposite, which is we know that hydrogen', 'sulfide, okay, is especially deadly at', 'some level well below the level that we', 'can detect it. So when you smell it, you', 'say, \"This is nasty. I\\'m going to go in', 'the opposite direction.\" It was still', \"far from killing you, but anyone who's\", 'But you know what?

I listen that', \"that's the first time I got in trouble\", 'in', 'chemistry, right? We made we made we had', 'hydrogen sulfide and we and I took it', 'and put it in a eye dropper and went', 'around and putting it on people so they', 'would smell like farts. You did that? I', 'did.

So, there's a uh there's a\", 'suspicion in our evolutionary past that', \"uh there's a there's an idea that\", 'hydrogen sulfide can build up in the', 'bottom of the ocean if the ocean uh', 'oxygen cycle stops. Then you have', 'anorobic life forms, okay? And hydrogen', 'sulfide is one of the byproducts of', 'them. And if it builds up to a big', \"enough bubble, it'll come up.

Give', 'me some more. This is John. He says,', '\"Hello, Dr. Tyson. Dr. Kate Lord Nice.\"', 'John here from Arkansas. I used to teach', 'high school chemistry, but I still All', 'right. Teacher applause. Uh, but I still', 'struggle with electron configurations,', 'especially in the transition metals.', 'What is it about that section of the', 'periodic table that makes it so dogone', 'convoluted? Yeah. And why are they', 'called transition metals? Cuz the edges', \"we they they're pretty clean clean. We\", 'can understand them. You got the gases,', 'the noble gases, and you got the, you', 'know, and you go to the middle and the', 'the their representation on the table is', 'different. Yes. Right. And you have and', 'these others that are a series, then', \"they pull those out. What's What's up\", \"with that? What's up with that? So, one\", 'of the reason make that cleaner for the', 'rest of us so we can learn it. I can', 'try. Um, so one of the reasons why', 'transition metals are called transition', 'metals is because they go through', 'different color changes. And so you can', 'actually see them transition through', 'their oxidation states. And so maybe', \"they're a plus two or a plus three. You\", 'can see the color change across the', 'table. Okay. Yeah. So you could just sit', 'there and watch your reaction go from', \"I'll just make up some colors. some blue\", \"to green to red and you're watching it\", 'go through different oxidation states so', 'you can actually monitor it. So in', 'organic chemists, which is what I do, we', \"usually like color changes and that's\", \"one of the reasons why we're drawn to\", 'that field is because we work with', 'transition metals in high school and', 'also what I taught which is general', 'chemistry. So the first year of college', 'chemistry um we do general trends and so', 'we say if something is like this it will', 'operate like this. We just try to', 'identify trends and so the S block and', 'the P block so the outside areas of the', 'periodic table they really follow these', 'trends but the middle the D block the', \"transition metals don't really follow\", 'the trends. sound like prison. Are you', 'in D block? What are you getting now?', \"Okay. And so and so that's what's hard\", 'about teaching it, especially in high', 'school, because there are no like', 'typical trends you can go by. Gotcha. No', 'general rules. So there are general', 'trends that you can go by. Um and', \"there's certain ones that always break\", 'rules like your jewelry metals. So', 'copper, silver, and gold will always', \"they're I'm going to nerd out on you,\", \"but they're usually D9, but because of\", 'the way the electrons fall, they go to', 'D10. And so they can just redistribute', 'their electrons. I cannot get as excited', \"about that as I'm sorry, but it's it's\", 'an explanation of why sounds like a boy', 'band, right? Oh, it does. I used to be', \"in D9, but now I'm in D10. No, it's the\", 'inorganic flaring. We talk about our d', 'orbitals and where our electrons are.', \"And so, I just love that part. And it's\", 'just where your electrons sitting. They', 'move around to be stable. If you have,', \"let's say you have five orbitals,\", \"there's 5 d orbitals. If you have two\", 'electrons in each one, we all knew that', 'five d orbs. You all knew it. Yeah, we', 'totally knew that. If you have two', 'electrons in each one, that provides', 'stability. But if you have two two two', \"and then one, it's less stable. And so\", 'what it does is it takes another', 'electron and move it over here to', 'provide stability. And so these specific', 'atoms like copper and silver and uh gold', \"will do that just naturally. And that's\", 'why it can be confusing for high school', \"students because you don't usually teach\", 'these exceptions. And for grown-ups. And', 'for grown-ups. Yeah. For everybody.', \"True. But he's a high school teacher. So\", 'there pull it back. Yeah. Okay. Cool.', 'Cuz in', 'astrophysics, nine out of 10 atoms in', 'the universe is hydrogen. Yeah. And', \"there's nothing easier than the hydrogen\", \"energy levels. And we don't even have to\", \"think about orbitals. There's just\", \"there's just a layer. Just there's just\", 'levels and the electron moves back and', 'forth. But when you have all of these', 'electron clouds, it gets way more', 'complicated.

Are they going to be', 'complimentary? Will it be bonding,', \"non-bonding, antib-bonding?

What', 'kind of properties do you think we might', 'be able to expect from atoms in it? Oo.', 'So, were you talking about the island of', 'stability, Neil, or or they just wanted', 'to point out that they saw you a couple', 'weeks ago? Yeah. So, this is something', 'that I think is really interesting', \"because as a chemist, I'm familiar with\", 'the band of stability, but the island of', 'stability is a little bit outside of my', 'reach. So, can I do band and then I', 'throw to you for island? Sure. Unless', \"they're the same thing and we just call\", \"them something different. Yeah. What's\", 'your band of stability? So, the band of', 'stability basically, which is another uh', 'boy band name. We The band of stability', 'actually that would be Cold Play. Okay.', 'All right.', 'Okay. Kate, got it.', 'The band the band of stability is all', 'about um figuring out what ratio of', 'neutrons to protons makes an atom most', 'stable. And so if you have 20 protons or', 'fewer the ratio is 1 one. If you have', 'more than 20 protons that number alters', 'a little bit. And so for uh chemistry', 'specifically atoms you have 1.5 neutrons', 'to every one proton. That gives you your', \"most stable atom. So that's how I think\", 'about it. Where does the island of', 'stability come in? Is that an extension?', 'Oh yeah. So okay so uh I can only tell', 'you how I have come to learn it and we', 'can maybe dovetail with what you', 'described above a certain atomic number.', 'Mhm. The nucleus is so large and every', 'one of them are unstable. You can ask', 'well what makes a stable element? Is it', 'stable forever or or just for a few', 'years or a few minutes? Right? So there', 'might be some practical definition of', 'what we call stable but for our purposes', 'all those big atoms do not live for long', \"and the ones we're discovering you know\", '101 102 103 which is the limit of the', 'table when I was in school uh 103 was', 'laorencium I think it was or still is', 'still is still thank you it turns out', 'that the calculations for the stability', 'of the nucleus when you go beyond the', \"ones we're currently discovering into\", 'the 120s 30. Somewhere in there, and I', 'forgot the exact range, somewhere in', 'there is an island of stable, very heavy', 'elements. Oo. And so you have to get', 'past the unstable ones. Typically, you', 'make another element by cramming protons', 'and or neutrons into a pre-existing', 'Californiaifornium. You you slam', 'California into a different other one.', \"Yeah, exactly. You're slamming unstable\", 'elements into other unstable element.', 'See if another unstable element shows', 'up. And some of them live for thousandth', 'of a second. So if you if you slam', 'californium into Alabama,', 'you definitely going to come up with', 'something', \"unstable. Bam. I tell you, I can't\", 'believe they came over here like they', 'did.', 'Alamium.', 'Oh, you got me with that one. Yeah.', \"Well done, liberals. I tell you, it'll\", 'be the color purple, though.', \"See, that's how you get out of that. So,\", 'so this has been described in physics as', 'an island of stability which we are all', 'just our appetite is wetted for it', 'because if you have a new element that', 'is stable what are you going to do with', 'it? What how how what properties does it', 'have? And that all happens to in the on', 'the chemical side not the physics side.', 'Yeah. Right. So with the island of', \"stability then are we saying that it's\", 'because I know like or whatever lasts', 'for less than a second right? So are we', \"saying so organisms? So that's the 118.\", \"18. That's the highest one we know about\", 'right now. The highest numbered one.', \"Yeah. Um so I guess what I'm curious\", 'about is then would these atoms then', 'stay around for are we talking seconds?', 'Are we talking years? Like what do we', 'think? My again my understanding is that', \"they're permanently stable. But what it\", 'would mean is your your rules either', 'have a new manifestation in those', 'heavier nuclei uh or somehow that rule', \"shows up again. Okay. But I we're all I\", \"can't wait till we get there. Right. I'm\", \"really intrigued by that cuz I'm curious\", \"if it's just like relative stability\", 'where it lasts maybe a second still or', 'instead of a thousand of a second.', \"Right. Right. Yeah. You couldn't still\", \"have a wad of it in your hand. That's\", \"what I'm curious about. Right. As am I.\", 'as am I. Have you ever wanted one of', 'your questions on the universe answered?', 'We all have questions about the', 'universe.

I'm probably the only person here\", \"who hasn't been to Dubai. I haven't been\", \"to Dubai. Okay. Okay. I've been several\", 'times. Well, we knew that.', 'Well, D.', \"So uh in space where there's no oxygen\", 'and gravity is minimal, how do chemical', 'reactions, especially combustion change', 'at the atomic level? Could studying', 'these reactions in a vacuum reveal new', 'insights into quantum effects like wave', 'function behavior in molecule bound', 'bonding or energy transfer? And quantum', 'mechanics says everything is', 'probabilistic. Is there a tiny chance my', 'candle would light just to mess with me?', 'Thank you, Neil. And I love you. And by', \"the way, that's the different kind of\", 'probabilistic. So go ahead. So we should', \"separate into two areas. There's what\", 'are you doing with no air, but you have', 'two molecules that might perhaps know', \"about each other's existence quantum\", 'mechanically through through', 'entanglement. Maybe that was a little', 'bit in there. The other one is just in', 'zero G. In zero G combustion is fun.', \"Tell tell us about that. Well, what's\", 'interesting about in zero G is that all', 'of our reactions behave like gasphase', \"reactions because we don't have gravity,\", 'right? And so we are we get to kind of', \"do stuff that we couldn't do on Earth,\", 'we can do it up in space because you can', 'move things around. They expand more.', 'Like a a pencil would never float around', 'here on Earth. It would stay at the', 'bottom of a beaker, right? Same thing.', \"Whereas if you're trying to put pencils\", \"in beers, well, I'm just I'm just trying\", 'to give a solid because if I give just a', 'random molecule, people might not know,', 'but you can visualize a pencil in a', 'beaker, right? Pencil molecule. a', \"pentlecule. Yes. It's staying at the\", \"bottom of a beaker. We know where it's\", \"going to sit. It's going to be at the\", 'bottom. It will have interaction. Yeah.', 'The whole time. But when we go to space', 'now, it moves around. So, we have solids', 'that essentially get to behave like a', 'gas. And so, the chemistry is just', 'different and you get to look at it. Um,', 'my question is, do we have combustion', 'reactions outside of Earth and outside', 'of the International Space Station? I', 'mean, do we we have to have oxygen to', 'have combustion, right? Yeah. Yeah. So,', 'so I guess um what I was really', 'referring to, which was accurately', 'portrayed in the movie Gravity, okay,', 'there was a small fire that began. Mhm.', 'And they just let it go and it', 'extinguished', 'itself because normally on Earth where', \"there's\", '1g, the heated gas rises, right,', 'bringing fresh oxygen in to continue the', \"combustion create. Yes. But here it's\", 'just it ate up the oxygen. No more', 'oxygen in town and the the this the CO2', \"whatever the byproducts can't feed the\", 'flame and it snuffed it out. Wow. So you', \"can't burn a candle in zero G is the\", 'point unless you have a gentle breeze.', 'Right. You have to have something moving', 'more uh oxygen molecules that way into', \"it. Right into it. That's so cool.\", 'Right. Right. So So that means I did not', \"know that. So you didn't know that. I\", 'love that. Which way? That is so you', 'cannot be romantic in space.', 'So, so anything that combusts it, it', \"assumes that it's just moving through\", 'the material to burn the whole thing,', 'right? A piece of paper burns the whole', \"and it's and we take it for granted.\", \"It's relying on hotter gases being less\", 'dense and rising. Yeah. Right. So, do', 'you ever try to think about those', 'experiments? I have not really thought', 'about it because all of my chemistry', \"happens on Earth and I'm terrified of\", \"leaving Earth and so that's usually\", 'where I stop. I just love that chemistry', 'I do is on Earth. Okay. No, but if we', \"needed you for space to consult, I'd say\", \"call someone else there. It's not\", \"happening. There you go. I don't do\", \"that. That scares me. I wouldn't go to\", \"space. No. No. I don't know why that's\", \"my line. It just scares me. I don't want\", \"to. I don't want You're flying in a\", 'plane. You\\'re like, \"Oh, halfway to a', 'rocket.\" I don\\'t I don\\'t know. No, no,', 'but in plane, you still have one G,', 'right? Okay. All right. What I think', 'about though is how you could do', 'different experiments in space. Like you', 'can do the experiments of a womb because', 'you can kind of replicate that and how', 'how the baby moves around with not in', 'zero gravity, but they have that vibe,', \"right? They're able to float around. So,\", 'you can do those type of experiments in', \"space. That's what I think about, right?\", \"Okay. And so, there's some reactions.\", \"What's a reaction that could only happen\", \"in in in zero g? I'm curious. Well, not\", \"only, but there's certain ways you could\", 'do it because I could think about taking', 'two different like solutions and have', 'the drops come and collide with each', \"other that you wouldn't be able to do on\", 'and create these many reactions right', \"there as they're floating. That's\", 'amazing. And just what have that unfold', 'right in front of you? So, solid', 'rockets. Could you do it inside like', \"what what's in the solid rockets? Solid\", \"fuel. No. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. It's\", 'a combination of No, no. The solid', 'rocket boosters. Yes. You can go in', \"there and like bang on the fuel. It's\", \"It's solid. That's why it's called solid\", \"rockets. That's why they call solid\", \"rockets. No, but generally there's\", \"another tank that can be That's what I'm\", 'talking about. That Oh. Oh, okay. That', 'tank. Yes. That has hydrogen and oxygen,', 'right? So, liqufied, which is way denser', 'than air. Okay. And then you take the', 'hydrogen, oxygen, and so now take us', 'from there. I got a tank twice as big', 'holding liquid hydrogen and half that', 'size holding liquid oxygen. And you got', \"to keep it really cold because they're\", \"liquefied, right? And that's why if you\", 'ever see the launch, you ever see you', 'ever see slow-mo rocket launches from', 'Florida, you see this chunks of ice', 'falling off the rocket that Florida is a', 'moist environment and the rocket is cold', 'and it just all the moisture gathers on', \"it. If you do that in a desert, you're\", 'not going to have condensation freezing', 'on it. Right. Cool. Okay. So, tell me', \"what's happening when you combine\", 'because in the subject of space, you', 'have liquid hydrogen to liquid oxygen.', 'And I just wave my hands and say yes, it', \"makes water and there's energy. But take\", 'me into that. So, a traditional', 'combustion reaction, traditional, not', \"what you're talking about, has a source\", 'of fuel that has carbon associated with', 'it. You treat it with oxygen and you', \"produce water and carbon dioxide. What's\", 'really neat about that would give you', 'energy. Yeah. And it releases energy.', \"It's exothermic. That's anything that\", 'burns basically. Anything organic that', \"burns. Yes. And that's why it turns\", \"black when it's done because it lays\", 'bare the carbon. Yes. Yes. Okay.', 'Perfect. But when you remove the carbon,', 'you can have a combustion reaction', \"that's much cleaner. And so that's when\", \"you what you're talking about. So you\", 'have hydrogen plus oxygen will give us', \"water. It'll still be combustion. Still\", 'be combustion. But but that that more uh', 'a cleaner kind. So that the exhaust of', 'that rocket is', 'Water. Water. There you go. There you', 'go.', \"We did it. That's awesome. That's very\", 'neat. So, do you think in quantum', 'physics two molecules can see each other', 'before they make contact? See each other', 'in a way that they say, \"I want to get a', 'little closer to you.\" I mean, I always', 'I the music', 'I in my mind all chemistry is driven', 'around the rearranging of atoms and', \"that's all driven by electrons either\", 'electron repulsion or attraction. So', \"that's how I think about interactions is\", 'where are the electrons? Are they', 'attracted to each other? What would be', 'cool is if two entangled particles', \"made an entangled molecule. Wouldn't\", 'that be weird? Whoa. That it would be', 'wild. So So that would be', 'weird. One molec one quantum molecule', \"with its bits separated, right? That'd\", 'be so weird. That would be weird. But', 'they have to be identical. Mhm. So maybe', 'a hydrogen makes a molecule H2. A lot of', 'oxygen, not nitrogen. We breathe O2 and', \"N2. So they're quantum entangled to make\", \"one molecule. That's a sci-fi story\", 'right there. It is. Wow. Be really', 'weird. Super cool. Okay. All right. All', 'right. Here we go. This is Alyssa. But', \"you're Kate the Earth Chemist, so that's\", 'not a future book coming out of you. All', 'right. Alyssa Feldos says this. Hello,', 'Alyssa from Rocket City Hunts Alabama.', 'My daughters Amelia and Olivia just love', 'you. Uh, my question is, what is the', 'biggest, most impressive kid-friendly', 'experiment I can do with a four and', '8-year-old that will keep them', 'interested in science for years to come?', \"We love a good bang and aren't afraid of\", \"getting dirty. Wow. Okay. That that's\", \"that's full cart blanch there. That's a\", 'loaded one cuz four-year-olds getting', 'with a bang. It makes me nervous. But um', 'I think if you have adults involved, you', 'could do the exploding paint can', 'experiment, which is really fun. Sounds', 'good. So,', 'you know, hey, when a four-year-old is', 'an adult,', 'some paint what the way she said. Yeah.', 'Everybody knows the exploding paint can.', 'I I picture it that they could help you', 'set it up and then the adult would', \"actually trigger the reaction. So, it's\", 'very simple. You just need a paint can,', 'empty, never had paint in it before. Put', 'about an inch of baking soda at the', 'bottom. Take a cup, plastic cup, uh,', 'fill it with vinegar, food coloring if', \"that's your flavor. And then nestle the\", 'cup into the baking soda. Into the', 'vinegar. Into the vinegar. Yep. In the', 'liquid. And then you can put the, uh,', 'cup of vinegar into the baking soda. So', 'like nestle it in like a sand castle.', \"Then you're going to put the lid on the\", 'paint can. Use a mallet to hammer it', 'shut. You want it completely shut. No', 'place for gas to escape. Now get the', 'kids out of there. They can go far away.', 'Put their safety goggles on. Then adults', 'also with safety goggles on. Always', 'safety goggles. Yeah. Shake it up, but', 'keep your head back because what will', 'happen is a neutralization reaction.', \"You'll release carbon dioxide just like\", 'we were talking about earlier with the', 'Mentos and Diet Coke. Yep. Exactly. And', \"then the lid flies up. It's really\", \"colorful. It's cute. Wait a minute. But\", \"why doesn't you have to sit it down\", \"afterwards, right? You can't hold that\", 'thing. Yeah, you should put it down.', 'Yeah, good point. Well, how do you know', \"when it's about to blow up? It happens\", 'very fast. So, what I do is I go shake,', 'shake, shake, and I slam it down on the', 'table and then I step back and then I', \"move on to my next one. And while I'm\", 'shaking my second one, the first one', 'goes off. Wow.', \"So why doesn't So I thought paint can\", 'lids were stronger than that. You know,', 'I think paint can lids are tight,', 'especially if you mallet it shut, but', \"apparently not. It's no match for CO2.\", \"Exactly. Cuz it's not secured. It's not\", \"locked in. And so it's not clamped.\", 'Exactly. So if you have all those CO2', 'molecules coming in going on that lid,', 'it will shoot it straight up in the air.', \"It's very fun. Wow. I love that one. And\", 'that happens in seconds. Yeah. And the', 'only reason why you put it in a in a', 'small plastic cup is to keep it separate', 'long enough to hit the lid. Exactly.', 'Because otherwise you it will escape.', 'All all the expanding gas will escape', 'before you get to mallet it down. So', 'when you nestle it in like that, you', 'keep everything separate. You mallet it', 'down. Now you mix it. Bang. And and you', \"throw it up first. So the liquid's going\", 'to go up and then it all slams down at', 'one time. And so when you shake it, it', 'actually really nicely distributes the', 'vinegar all over. It grabs that baking', 'soda and then you get the cool acid', 'based neutralization reaction. All', 'right. Very pumpy. Keep your head back.', 'Keep your head back cuz you could get', \"hit in the face. Yeah. See, I'm going to\", 'let my kid do that. How old is your kid?', 'This is the money', \"maker. I don't care how old the kid is.\", \"It don't matter.\", \"Can't have a panc blown up in this.\", 'Like, sorry, baby. This is what pays', 'this is what pays the mortgage. So you', 'shake that can and put it down as', \"quickly as possible. But you can't\", 'overstate the need for goggles for all', 'your only your experiments. Yeah. I', 'usually wear goggles, a lab coat, and', 'gloves. It is a little overkill', 'sometimes, but I like to set a good', 'example. It would break my heart if a', 'kid got injured doing something they', 'watch me do. Gotcha. Gotcha. All right.', 'Hello, Dr. Tyson and Dr. Beverdorf and', 'Lord Nice. James from Denmark here. What', 'would you say are the most promising', 'developments in applied chemistry today?', 'Oh man. Do you', 'claim material scientists in your', 'community? Oo, I do.

But so now we have an answer.', 'We can use it and go troubleshoot and', \"see if that will work. And so what I'm\", 'really interested right now is how those', 'two worlds are kind of merging together', 'and how we can use that to do better', 'research and more effective research.', \"And so that's that's what's happening\", 'right now and I am really excited about', \"that.

It's like, you\", 'know, well, it has a lot of information', 'that it can pull together everything and', 'and it can think in terms of I use the', 'term think it can think in terms of', 'future combinations that we could never', 'even get to. We would not have time to', 'get to it because it can calculate them', \"all at once. Aren't there books that\", 'have all the chemical potentials of all', 'reactions or Oh, are you talking about', \"the CRC? Yes, you know, I have one. It's\", 'a huge book. What is that? Oh, what does', 'that stand for? Uh, something rubber', 'company. I mean, consolidated rubber', 'company. Is that true? So, there are', 'these compilations of all these', 'properties that have been discovered', 'peacemeal and assembled into these', 'volumes. Any scientist, we have a CRC on', 'our shelves. So, that whoever that', 'company was, they decided to compile all', 'the information you could ever want in', 'science. There you go. Okay. You know', 'what I did? I found at auction u a a CRC', 'from my birth year. So I bought it. So', 'that that is a that is a slice in time', 'of what we knew about the chemistry, the', 'physics, the bi. It is all science in', \"there including math. Okay. So so here's\", \"the the point. It's a thousand pages. I\", 'it would take me a lifetime to read', 'through it. But AI could ingest it and', 'come up with two minutes chemicals. Why', \"wouldn't couldn't it? Right. It's it's\", 'the best of both worlds, right? Because', 'you you list I is it is the word', 'chemical potential? What is the the how', 'the likelihood that two atoms will come', \"together? What do you what's the well\", 'atoms or electrons? Cuz potential outer', 'electrons. Yeah. Usually potential when', \"we're talking about that activation\", 'potentials or whatever. Sure. Activation', 'energies. Energies. So they know it. So', \"the book has it. But you're not going to\", 'sit there and read a thousands of thing', 'and come up with a new molecule. Let it', 'do it. But let it do it while you out on', 'the beach sipping a pinina cola. And', 'then you get a notification on your', 'phone. I found that new', \"you've been looking for. And then you\", 'say, \"Ai, write the paper. Publish it.\"', \"It's like the best grad student you\", \"could have. Yeah. It's so funny. All\", \"right. It's been said primarily because\", \"it's basically true that there's no\", 'understanding of chemistry without', \"physics. And there's no understanding of\", 'biology without chemistry.

Uh Tom, you're absolutely\", 'right that the general theory of', 'relativity is a superseded theory that', 'covers uh includes I should say Isaac', \"Newton's original universal theory of\", 'gravity and that is that on small scales', 'like scales of the earth scales of a', 'solar system for example you cannot tell', 'the difference small things like the', 'solar system yeah exactly you cannot', 'tell the difference between acceleration', 'and the curv richer space-time gravity.', 'Got it. So, they will look almost', 'exactly the same and they should look', 'exactly the same and very small scales.', 'So, there have been experiments done to', 'show whether or not gravity like is a', 'true force or it is a truly a curvature', 'of spaceime and so far the two of them', 'follow that so-called equivalence', \"principle. So, so it's both. It is both\", 'onesially,', 'right? In the circumstances that we are', 'circumstances', \"come in extreme environments when you're\", 'not looking at sort of earthlike or or', 'local environments. One example is a', 'black hole, right? Where you might', 'indeed have a circumstance where you can', 'tell the difference between a', 'gravitational activity curves or', 'curvature space-time gravitational', 'activity and a force that measures out', 'exactly like that curvature. But how', 'much of this is just semantics? Like who', \"cares whether it's curvature or\", 'Newtonian if it it accelerates an object', 'and let that just be the force. Why are', 'we even bickering over this?

Okay? Otherwise you get', 'the wrong answer. Very good. Okay. So,', 'but then we we we learn if you take', 'physics class in chemistry about these', 'other forces, electromagnetic, the weak', 'nuclear force, the strong nuclear force.', 'Yes. And then, you know, we add gravity', \"as a fourth force there. But you're\", \"saying we shouldn't add gravity. The\", 'problem is that gravity is creating that', 'very strange boundary condition. The', 'standard model about particles that we', 'use, you know, the quarks and the', 'lepttons and things like that do not', 'include a particle that moves gravity', 'around. So if gravity is a fundamental', 'force, there should exist a particle we', 'expect there to be called a graviton', 'based on our understanding because all', 'other forces have these mediating', 'particles. So a graviton must be', 'detected. But wait, hang on. So what', 'propagates the electromagnetic force?', 'The photon. And what propagates the weak', \"force? the W and Z particles that that's\", 'obvious', 'and what what propagates the strong', 'force gluons. So there ought to be', 'keeping in the tradition of this sort of', 'standard model of particles and their', 'associated forces. The gravity should', 'have a particle associated with it. And', 'what was that be? The graviton.', \"Graviton. Yes, that's right. Photon\", 'gluon gluon. graviton and the', 'intermediate vector bzon. So now let me', 'ask you this though. The photon has no', 'mass, right? Correct. None of the No.', 'Does a gluon have a a mass? Gluons do', 'not have mass either. How about Y and Z?', 'In actually the W and Z particles do', \"have mass. Yeah, that's there you go.\", \"That's so that is the what's going on\", 'about that? These particles are still', \"being studied. We're trying to figure\", 'out what they are and and well, you know', 'what? Maybe the concept of mass is is in', 'itself worth talking about for a moment', 'because mass and energy are equivalent.', 'Right? You can switch back and forth', 'between them. So when we say we have a', \"massless particle, right? We're not\", \"saying that it has nothing. We're saying\", 'that it can carry energy which can be', 'converted into mass under the right', 'conditions. Right? So a photon for', 'example can have as much energy as a', 'baseball. Some of the most powerful', \"photons. But you they won't measure on a\", 'scale. A baseball thrown by a pitcher.', 'Yeah, right. Not just a baseball. Yeah,', 'that too. Well, E= MC², right? Implicit', \"in your statement was it's a baseball\", 'thrown at 90 mph. So, you have this huge', \"amount of stuff that's there even though\", 'there is no mass. So, so given that so,', 'so one of the the mysteries of the', 'standard model and how our subatomic', 'universe works is indeed what has mass', \"and why and what doesn't have mass and\", 'why, right? So can you call energy', 'potential mass? You could. You could', 'call it that. Yes. But what happens now?', \"We have to bring in Tom's concept of\", 'quantum physics, right? General', 'relativity and quantum mechanics have a', 'real hard time connecting with each', 'other. That when you try to use these', 'ideas of particles to explain gravity or', 'the motion of things, you get stuck. The', \"theory, the math doesn't quite match.\", 'And so this speculation that Tom has', 'about hey is a black hole which has', 'general relativity whatever uh could it', 'be affected by quantum physics and this', 'idea of in in this case the many worlds', 'interpretation could it be? It could but', \"the math doesn't show it yet. So this is\", \"a this is actually a frontier that we're\", 'trying to wonder. Uh some folks have', 'speculated that you could actually use', 'quantum physics to communicate within', 'black holes. So you go from the interior', 'of one black hole and be able to', 'transfer to the interior of another', \"black hole. But it still wouldn't\", 'translate out into our how would you', \"ever find out? Because you can't get any\", 'of the information out of the black', 'hole. So the math works in these', 'speculative ways. The black hole stays', 'as far as we know, right? the cosmic', 'fight club', \"never we don't talk about the event\", 'horizon. Yeah. So fight club stay tuned', 'Tom as I is what I would say. Uh odds', 'are what you just speculated is not the', 'case but mathematically people are still', 'working on ways to make it possible and', 'then we have to figure it out. We have', 'to test it to see if we can make these', 'predictions actually manifest in', 'observations. Do you think the day will', \"come where we'll discover a graviton?\", \"Yes. We're pretty close already. Okay.\", \"The the reason we're close is because of\", 'the gravitational wave detectors that we', 'found, right? There are some people', 'making calculations and saying, well, if', 'gravitational waves actually do exist,', 'which we have now shown they do, then', 'there must be a graviton, right? So, the', 'implication that gravitons exist is', \"there. Now, it's a matter of actually\", 'detecting one. And that is the bugaboo.', 'The graviton is so uh low energy, right?', \"And there's so many of them that being\", 'able to pick one out or to have enough', 'data to show that these particles', 'actually exist is extremely difficult.', 'That is wild. All right. All right, man.', 'Wow. I wish I spoke math.', \"You do just fine. Let's go to Parker\", 'Man. And he says, uh, Parker Man. Parker', 'Man. All right, Parker Man. Greetings,', 'Dr. Lou Tyson. Lord Nice from Ventura,', 'California. Parker man here thinking', 'about colliding black holes. I wonder', 'what happens just prior to the merger of', 'the event horizons. Consider a binary', 'pair of black holes slowly spiraling', 'towards each other. Assuming the', 'original stars were formed at the same', 'time, they would have the same sense of', 'rotation and revolution about each', 'other. This would include the frame', 'dragging around each body. Just before', 'the horizons merge, the region between', 'them will have a collision of sorts as', 'the linear motions of frame dragging', 'will be in the opposite directions. What', 'effect would this confluence of opposing', 'frame motions have? Might the stress on', 'spaceime increase Hawking radiation', 'temporarily or even possibly trigger', 'vacuum decay if the holes were massive', 'enough? Man, let me tell you something.', \"First of all, don't be trying to get us\", 'to do your advanced physics homework.', \"That's number one. All right. Number\", 'two, make your questions shorter.', 'Exactly.', 'Holy crap. First of all, this is', 'somebody who studies astrophysics.', 'He knows Tom. Hands down. Tell us what', \"frame dragging is. So, what's the deal?\", 'Yeah. Frame drag. Colliding black holes.', 'Frame dragging. Yes. As you get closer', 'and closer to event horizon and as', \"you're moving, right, your time sense,\", 'the dilation of it becomes very visible.', \"So when you're in one direction\", 'compared to the other direction of', 'rotation or motion or whatever you have,', \"you'll actually wind up with a different\", 'view of the same object. Right? And and', \"that kind that's sort of the basic\", \"general concept. It's all about frame of\", \"reference. That's right. It's all about\", 'because your frame of reference is being', 'dragged by the gravitational curvature', 'uh of space time. But wait, let me I', 'think you have to show some show people', \"what you're talking about cuz I don't\", 'think people understand when black holes', \"you're talking about you're actually\", 'talking about something that is tangible', \"but not tangible and they're moving\", 'towards each other and they do this they', 'spiral around and around and around and', 'then they hit each other. Right. Right.', 'Just to be just to be clear, hardly ever', 'in the universe are two objects falling', 'towards each other on exactly the same', \"line for a collision. It's not like two\", 'two trains on the same track. Right.', \"Exactly. Exactly. So there's always some\", \"non-alignment. And when there's\", 'non-alignment, you have the opportunity', \"for spiraling. That's correct. So this\", 'question, which Parker man has done,', 'wait is is Parker a new superhero?', 'Parker Man.', 'Anyway, as Parker is saying here,', \"Parker, you're saying it exactly right.\", \"Right. You're wondering what the\", 'interaction is between two black holes', 'as they spiral closer and closer. And', 'the answer is gravitational waves. You', 'get gravitational waves released and you', 'get this energy that comes off. And the', 'way that the black hole collides does', 'lead to differences in what kind of', 'energy gets released and in what', 'quantity and in what direction and', 'things like that. So your question, the', 'answer, the very short answer to that', \"question, Neil, you can tell me if I'm\", 'wrong, is yes. Okay. To all those', 'things, those are all possibilities. And', 'then which individual collisions cause', 'what kinds of things to squirt out? That', 'is still a a subject of intense research', \"and up to the geometry of what's going\", 'on. Yeah.

So\", \"I I'm all for that even though I know\", 'dark matter is probably some more exotic', \"particle. That's right. But that wasn't\", 'directly related to the black hole', 'question. It was just a side point,', \"right? It's a thing that would be cool.\", \"Like you said, there's mathematical\", 'possibilities.

And in a\", 'three-dimensional volume, the strength', 'drops off as the surface of the sphere', \"gets bigger. That's r squared. Mhm. If\", \"you have four dimensions, there's some\", 'dimension going out of this uni spatial', 'dimensions going out of this universe', \"into the next universe to that's a\", \"that's a higher dimension. And that's\", 'the dimension through which their', 'gravity would leak. Right? So it would', 'so the power of their gravity would drop', 'off precipitously at one', '[Music]', 'r to the third power third power which', 'is way faster than ordinary gravity in', 'this universe.

So, it's already\", \"dominating this universe and it's\", 'dropped off by the third power of', 'distance in a fourth dimension, which', 'means we can never go where it comes', \"from.

So, I'm have I'm\", 'eating lunch and I almost like choked', 'eating lunch with I think it was Brian', 'Green. Yeah.

Let's be honest, you\", 'know, Texas.', 'Yeah. Recent supernova data is revealing', 'something mindbending about our', 'universe. Instead of mysterious dark', 'energy, scientists found evidence that', 'time itself flows at different rates', 'throughout space. Faster in the vast', 'empty voids, slower where matter clumps', \"together. I think that's a scientific\", \"term. like Einstein's time dilation but\", 'on a cosmic scale. Are we witnessing our', \"generation's Capernac moment where our\", 'basic understanding of the cosmos needs', 'to be rewritten? If this new model is', 'right, what does it mean for the fate of', 'our universe? Interesting. Wow, Charles.', 'I have not read I have not read those', 'papers. Uh so I cannot tell you whether', 'it is actually a capernican revolution', 'right now or not. What what I think he', \"he's referring to is that may be a way\", 'to interpret the data but another way', \"was that Einstein's cosmological\", 'constant right can vary right from one', 'time in the universe to another whereas', 'in his equations it is a constant okay', 'so something has to give here and well', 'in in his original equation it was just', 'lambda right but lambda uh as a function', 'of time has been built into equations', 'after he first proposed it. So lambda of', 't is certainly something that is', 'mathematically possible whether but his', 'theory did not allow for that. So if his', 'theory is an accurate description of the', \"world then what we're saying is then the\", \"world can't have a time dependent lambda\", 'and if the world does have a time', 'dependent lambda then his theory is not', 'complete. He knew his theory was not', \"complete when he designed it. That's\", \"true. That's the whole point. Yeah. Th\", 'this is I think exactly what Mut is', 'describing, right? This is it time to', 'supplement', 'a long-standing theory with something', \"new, right? And so whether it's a\", 'Capernac moment or not, I think there', 'are probably other interpretations that', \"would be simpler to follow AAM's razor\", 'and not necessarily have to require', 'brand new physics. Right? For example,', 'if we have a big clump uh of matter, we', 'know that it acts like a gravitational', 'lens, right? And gravitational lensing', 'will cause, for example, the light', 'coming from a distant object behind the', 'lens to appear to have curved around it,', 'right? And so that result could much', 'more easily explain these observations', \"of these supernova that it's more a\", 'gravitational lensing effect or some', \"more complicated thing that we don't\", 'understand than the need to bring in a', 'whole new varying cosmological constant', 'kind of physical and I would add a point', 'that recently in an explainer that I did', 'with Chuck titled on being wrong where', 'Capernacus himself was wrong. Sure. And', 'you have to ask well do we throw out the', 'entire idea that the sun is in the', 'middle of the universe or do we look for', 'some adjustment to this basic idea and', '50 years later Kepler would discover', 'ellipses as opposed to perfect circles', 'and so there are aspects of his idea', 'that needed modification without', \"throwing out the whole idea. So I'm with\", 'Charles on this that it could be an', 'important scientific moment but not on', 'the scale of a capernican moment. So', 'Matt, you know, even if you are wrong,', \"that's not necessarily bad, right? This\", 'is a I think what science helps us', 'understand. If we understand that', \"science is a process of learning what's\", \"right and wrong, we're not demanding\", 'that I am right, you go home, but rather', \"I'm right in this aspect, you're right\", 'in that aspect, and together we reach', \"something that's more complex than\", 'either of us could have achieved.

This is Trisha Lynch.', 'Hello, Dr. Tyson. Trisha Lynch. Yes. And', 'she says, \"Hello, Dr. Tyson. Dr. Lou', 'Lord.\" Nice Gary. Uh Trisha from', 'Beaverton or Oregon here. Uh if there', 'really is life under the water of Europa', 'or one of the other moons,', 'will there be any way for us to observe', 'it without possible crosscontamination?', 'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You probably', 'have more about this than I do. Well, we', 'did a whole episode on the Europa', \"Clipper mission. We did. It's in our\", 'archives. Check it out. Yeah. NASA has', 'an office of planetary protection.', 'Correct. And it primary goal is to make', 'sure that crosscontamination does not', 'happen by saving us from Thanos.', \"For example, there's a very famous uh\", 'short story, award-winning short story', 'written by physicist David Brin called', 'The Giving Plague, where we bring back a', 'pathogen from Mars. Uh not the Giving', 'Tree by Shell Silverstein. By Shell', 'Silverstein, right? Different different', 'book. The number one most important', 'thing is to make sure that our', \"spacecraft don't crash, right? We want\", 'to make sure that their orbits are', 'solid, that they have enough boosting', 'situation, and at the end of the', 'mission, we dispose of the spacecraft in', 'a way that will not contaminate any', 'potential environments. This is what', 'happened with both the Galileo space', 'probe and the Cassini space crew around', 'Jupiter and Saturn respectively. But we', 'crashed Cassini purposely and we crashed', 'Galileo purposely as well. And did we', 'but we crashed them into the atmospheres', 'of Jupiter and Saturn.', 'know that they were all burned up. Oh', 'yeah, exactly. Instead of landing', 'somewhere and contaminating the space,', 'they would all just be be burnt up.', \"We're not so careful about our own\", 'space. Sadly, no. We have an issue in', 'our local near near Earth orbit', 'ecosystem.

So hello Dr.\", 'Tyson, Dr. Lou and I am assuming Chuck', 'and Gary and assumed you have right. Um', 'I am Lily Rose from Virginia. My', 'question is what data can the recent', 'probe flying close to the sun give us?', 'How can we use this mission in the', 'future to explore the nature of other', 'stars in our galaxy? I was very curious', 'about the goals of this mission. Thank', 'you all for that and uh all for what you', 'do. Rose, thank you. Great question.', 'That is a great question. Did you do', 'something about the Parker Solar Probe', 'recently? Oh, we did. We did a we did an', 'explainer on it. It was more just to put', \"it in context for people who've never\", \"heard of it. I I don't know how deeply\", 'we went into the science that would come', 'of it. We just know that it went faster', 'than any previous spacecraft, closer to', 'the sun than any previous spacecraft,', 'got hotter than any previous spacecraft.', \"It's going to study the solar wind of\", 'course, solar flares, the particle', 'fluxes, this sort of thing. I see. Well,', 'solar science has a number of amazing', 'questions which surprisingly we still', \"don't know the answer to even though the\", 'sun is so close to us, right? Only 93', 'million miles away. One such question is', 'the transition from the surface of the', 'sun, the photosphere, which is about', '11,000 degrees Fahrenheit, out to the', 'Yeah. 11,000. Well, he he just started', 'here. Give him a chance. Out to the', 'corona of the of the sun, which is', 'millions of degrees. Millions, right? It', \"has to actually you you'd imagine that\", 'the further away you get from the sun,', 'the colder it gets.

Not cold.', \"There's no part of the sun that's cold.\", 'Fair enough. Fair enough. As you get to', 'that boundary, suddenly right in the', 'area where the Parker Solar Probe is', 'starting to probe, it has to heat up', 'again. What energies are being', 'transferred? What kinds of mechanisms', 'are growing your temperature again from', '10,000 to millions? Now wait, is there a', 'cooling or is is it literally we see a', 'decrease in temperature then all of a', 'sudden to the surface from the surface', 'all from the photosphere but then we get', 'to the corona and all of a sudden it it', \"heats. That's right. between between the\", 'photo between the corona. Now, but is', 'there any reaction that we can like', 'identify that might be making something', \"like this happen? It's the solar probe.\", 'How about that? Oh my god, I think I', 'came up with an idea.', \"Why don't we send something to\", 'investigate? Is this temperature change', 'completely around the circumference or', 'is it isolated pockets? Piece by piece.', \"Really? It's kind of like an envelope,\", 'but the envelope has holes in it. So,', \"it's inhomogeneous, heterogeneous, shall\", 'we say, and also there is actually a', 'layer there between the photosphere and', \"the corona. It's called the\", 'chromosphere. And that area is very', 'mysterious to us. So, all of our', 'hypotheses here on Earth about how that', 'heating happens and what the energy', 'transfer is from the surface of a star', 'out into space need to be tested with', 'data. So the Parker Solar Probe helps us', 'understand how stars transfer that', 'energy outward and that affects', \"everything that's orbiting those stars\", 'such as planets which NASA calls space', 'weather, right? And so just to put a', 'little molecular talk in here. So', 'temperature is the average vibration', 'speed of molecules. So you get to the', 'surface of the sun and there they are', 'vibrating and now something happens', \"where now they're vibrating faster,\", \"right? Okay. So something's flinging\", 'them out. some energy source is pumping', 'it, but the the corona is very rarified.', 'So would would you holding aside the', 'radiation of the sun itself? Sure. If', \"you're in a bath of a million degrees\", 'with only like a molecule hitting you', 'here and here, what would that feel like', \"to you? It wouldn't feel like much. The\", 'the irony is although the temperature of', 'the corona is millions of degrees, if', 'you put a potato in the corona in the', \"corona, it really wouldn't bake. because\", 'the the amount of heat in this plasma is', 'tiny per unit volume. So in the volume', \"of a potato, you wouldn't actually have\", 'enough heat in there to bake the potato.', 'But with the energy flowing through it', 'over long periods of time, you would fry', 'that potato and dissolve it into atoms', 'like in due course because the energy is', 'so flow is strong, the energy density is', 'low. And so these are the kinds of', 'contradictions that we need to get data', 'on that the Parker Solar Probe can help', \"us understand. And just so we're on the\", 'same page, a cup of coffee is hot.

is\", 'Galaxy uh Hey Dr Tyson Dr Lou I galaxy', 'is the person uh yeah galaxy galaxy okay', \"that's there uh I am Brian from\", 'Roseville California I just recently', \"joined the patreon and I'm excited have\", 'my question answered welcome yes thank', 'say it right welcome to the', 'universe okay we dim the lights when you', 'hear', 'that I have always wondered how Giant', 'Gas clouds and nebula exist in space', \"shouldn't the vacuum cause all gas to\", 'disperse evenly to the point of not', 'being even even being able to see it I', 'love that because on Earth any cloud of', \"gas disperses that's right as as dogs\", \"know that's right dogs will smell you\", 'from far away because whatever is your', 'stank one minute in and he say the guest', 'has', 'stank uh this is a lesson anybody', 'watching on how not to host the show at', \"least it's not smell a\", 'vision gracious yeah so it does it', 'dissipate and you look at blood in the', 'water and that that does it dissipate', \"evenly that well there it's a diffusion\", 'equation where you have molecules it', \"wouldn't happen in solid cuz all the\", 'molecules are just rigid but in a in a', \"fluid they can vibrate no but you're not\", 'going to move it through the the system', \"no there's a phase there's a phase issue\", \"I'm saying it's not going to move\", 'through the system just trying to get', 'technical okay and wow this is getting', 'tense already well he called me skank I', \"mean what am I supposed to do I didn't\", \"say skank I stank stank let's do our own\", 'show okay out', 'here so so the diffusion equate so you', 'have a molecule that can move like all', 'the others and it just works its way', 'through yeah in my high school we had', 'there was a diffusion experiment where', \"they there a long tube it's one of these\", \"display because we didn't have any\", 'athletic trophies to put geeky so you', 'got put other stuff in your hallway', \"display cases it's a hall of beakers is\", 'that yeah one of them is a very tall', 'Beaker yes about this tall if I remember', 'correctly that was little not much', 'little I think it was this big and there', 'was ink at the bottom and they carefully', 'put water on top of it y mhm and', 'throughout the year you got to watch cuz', 'the ink is slightly denser but still', \"they're both fluids and so you get to\", 'watch the ink work its way up real', 'slowly yeah in at my high school they', 'had diffusion experiments every', 'afternoon after the school lunches were', 'served bean soup oh and in every', 'classroom', 'experiment of different particles', 'suspended in the atmosphere moving from', 'one side of the classroom to the other', 'after you first heard that something', \"people didn't figure out to not eat the\", \"bean soup exactly and that's where you\", 'got your name skank stank stank stank', 'stank so did you um but would could you', 'do that same with the ink could you do', 'it with oil like cooking oil or well', \"it's harder no cuz oil would float and\", 'the misil between oil and water is very', 'different between because ink is has is', 'most inks that we used are water-based', 'anyway so the water is finding the water', 'molecules yeah so so Brian your the', 'answer is basically the conditions out', 'in space make it so that these gas', 'particles tend to disperse unless they', 'have a reason to collect okay here on', 'Earth you have different kinds of things', 'like buoyancy involved and things like', 'that that also happens in space but in', 'space when the temperatures are very low', 'say', '400° below z f gravity can actually', 'overcome a lot of the emotional sort of', 'dispersive diffusive emotional emotional', 'emotional yes it could be emotional you', \"know I ain't doing\", \"it it's very moving that's right you\", 'tear up you start crying a lot emotional', 'I never heard that word to become a star', 'oh my gosh yeah yeah some become

they they look like HSE', \"heads they look like helixes and Cat's\", \"eyes and things like that um and that's\", 'completely because the turbulence is', 'still going ontic', 'both we got to ask these stars that are', 'emitting their planetary nebula what are', 'they smoking you know I think that would', 'be a very very good idea but the bottom', 'line is that in space you have gravity',

family of', 'stars so that eats up most of the mass', \"of the gas cloud but there's part of the\", \"gas that didn't participate in the\", 'formation of the planet snoody like you', 'were in high school little', \"standoffish it just wasn't was and that\", \"gas doesn't always land on a star do we\", 'know why in all serious well now now the', \"gas doesn't have enough gravity to make\", \"it a Next Star we're done no but at the\", \"time and I'm not trying to be too far\", 'away that gas like all the other gases', 'had an equal opportunity part of that', \"it's not an equal opportunity system if\", \"you're a little too far away you not you\", 'might not feel the strong enough gravity', 'to participate and the stars form', 'without you and then this and I like', \"that hand gesture because I'll follow up\", 'on it the whole galaxy is is rotating', 'okay so your whole system with your', \"stars and your gas is moving and there's\", 'B other stuff so your gas can get', 'stripped

That's exactly why Star\", 'continues to partner with Ground News.', 'They built an app and website that helps', 'us separate speculation from science.', 'With one swipe, we can find original', 'research and highly factual sources', 'covering the most complex breakthroughs', 'in', 'cosmology.

So, we left', 'off in your complicated life where you', 'had the Bicep 2 experiment that reported', 'what would later be determined to be an', 'erroneous detection. Meanwhile,', 'Jim Simons,', \"seeing what you're seeking, Yeah. wanted\", 'to participate in that put you head of', 'an early version of the Simons', \"Observatory, some variant, Simon's\", 'array, some Yeah. But then the Bicep 2', \"result comes out. That's right. Which is\", \"not good for him. That's right. Because\", 'Bicep 2 is leading the world to Well, we', 'think has has discovered this these', 'these ripples. Exactly. But but really', \"they haven't. But he doesn't know that.\", 'So he\\'s like, \"Bro, what\\'s up with my', 'money?\" Right. Okay. I want it back. So', \"he calls me up and I'm like, I don't\", 'know what to say because I knew in the', 'back of my mind there could be problems', 'with the result and we might need to', 'confirm it with another instrument,', 'which later turned out to be the case or', 'that we were actually right. And yeah,', 'maybe I might have to say, \"Look, you', 'got to get I got to give you back your', 'money. I got to have some integrity and', 'you know, and refund your money, so to', 'speak.\" And I was going crazy cuz where', 'do you get, you know, $10 million and', \"give it back to Adam? No, that's Let me\", \"tell you something. That's when I just\", 'ran out of integrity.', 'We ran out of money and integrity at the', 'same time. 10 out of 10 $10 million. No', 'more integrity.', 'So then how was it determined? Yeah, cuz', \"I I remembered this. I wasn't close to\", 'it, but it was it was happening. It was', 'a very important it was an important', 'episode in science actually. Okay. So', \"now tell me why it's so important. Can I\", 'before you even get there, can you tell', 'me exactly what was missing from the', 'discovery that invalidated? Absolutely.', 'Let me take one giant step back. Why are', 'we doing any of these projects to begin', 'with? So looking for gravitational', 'waves. Take yourself back to 2014,', \"right? We hadn't detected LIGO had not\", 'made its detection of gravitational', 'waves. Obama was president.', 'Ukraine had not been invaded the first', 'time. Hold on, guys. Give me one second.', \"I'm staving off. Once he said Obama was\", 'president, I\\'m like, \"Oh god.\" The', 'elevator had not been risen. Okay, go', 'ahead. How to how to annoy Chuck. Uh so,', 'so at that phase, we had not detected', 'gravitational waves directly as LIGO', 'had. We had an indirect evidence that', 'they existed, but uh but there was a', 'theory that had been promagated since', 'the early 1980s by Alan Guth. So, the', 'inflationary theory is the answer to the', 'question, what caused the big bang? What', 'made the big bang bang? And the postula', \"is that there's a so-called quantum\", 'field that filled the whole universe', 'that fluctuated out of nothing and the', 'universe became came into existence as', 'quantum quant.', 'They do stuff out of nothing all the', 'time. They are the magicians of the', 'universe. Yes. Everything quantum', 'actually pull the universe out of my', \"hand. That's exactly what\", 'they universe over there on a', 'fluctuation. There you go. All right. So', 'this discovery, if it were true, if it', 'were confirmed, would be tantamount to', 'discovering the big bang itself, which', 'it was done not far from here by Pensas', 'and Wilson. Discovery of the CMBB, the', 'cosmic microwave background, which is', 'what butters the bread around the Keing', 'house. Pius Wilson at Bell Labs in', 'Jersey. Exactly. Not too far from here.', \"State, too. By the way, it's across the\", \"Hudson River. That makes it far. That's\", \"right. Okay. I know you you're in here\", \"from San Diego. Don't Don't listen to\", \"Long Island. He's a man. I'm a New\", 'Yorker. He lives in New Jersey. So', 'that is true. You have Long Island', \"roots. Uh yeah, that's Stony Brook.\", \"Yeah, Stony. Oh my god. Yeah, that's\", 'where Jim and my dad were professor. Oh,', \"that's why that would be the case. So,\", 'so inflation. So, we claimed that we', \"discovered this. So, that's why everyone\", 'said this is going to win a Nobel Prize', 'because they won a Nobel Prize for', 'discovering just the heat left over from', 'the big bang. All the more so for', 'discovering what ignited the spark that', 'ignited the big bang. So, that was why I', 'designed Bicep originally. Then it', 'became bicep 2 like the iPhone gets new', 'detectors, cameras, we upgraded it. So', 'we ended up building this telescope and', 'then when I got this call from Jim', 'Simons I was in this pickle right', \"because I don't know what to say. I kind\", 'of invented I was kind of the father of', 'the predecessor experiment to bicep 2', 'bicep one and you know I was definitely', 'the father of that and and then I was', 'involved with this new project that he', 'was funding. Now what ended up happening', 'was we had relied on data not from our', 'own instrument actually someone had', 'taken a picture of a PowerPoint slide', 'from our arch nemesis the plank', 'experiment. So the plank experiment is a', 'billion euro experiment. BICEP was a', 'mere$10 million US dollar. The European', 'Space Agency out at L2range point', 'orbiting around the sun, the Earth,', 'farthest, coldest, deepest, darkest,', 'incredible team. Thousand people', 'working. So Earth Sun L2. Earth Sun L2.', \"That's where JWSC is. Yeah, exactly. It\", 'was one of the first. It was the second', \"one after hanging out. They're just\", \"chilling. They're chilling like they're\", 'on steakout. Two cops on Steakout', 'sitting there at L2.', 'You should you go for coffee this time.', 'I went for coffee last time. It is true', \"cuz they're like parked there. Yeah. As\", 'Earth orbits the sun. Think about', 'getting a validation out there. I mean,', 'that is not easy. So, Jim calls me up.', \"What's going on and what to do next? So,\", \"we ended up discovering that we didn't\", 'see this pattern that would be the', \"impromaturtor of the Big Bang. We didn't\", 'see this cosmic swirling curls from the', \"big bang. Who determined you didn't see\", 'it? We along with our competitor the', 'plank teams that we worked together to', 'find out that actually what we saw was', 'nothing more than some cosmic schmutz,', 'right? Some dust. It was people who', \"study dust call it. That's right. To\", \"them it's their livelihood. One\", \"astronomer's dust is another\", \"astronomer's Nobel lost Nobel Prize. So\", \"it wasn't a blunder joke. It wasn't like\", 'we left, you know, put our thumb over', 'the over the camera or something like', 'that. We actually measured exquisitly', 'precisely this signal that is', 'astrophysical in origin at the mill', 'billions of degree Kelvin level. I mean', \"it's an exquisite. So but it's a local\", 'signal not a big happened to be a', \"different signal. Exactly. That's all.\", 'So so congratulations on the precision', 'of the merit. You idiot interpreting it', 'the wrong way. However, what it did was', \"it's like oh this thing works. This\", \"experiment basically it's the most\", \"precise measurement of what's called an\", 'astrophysical foreground. something in', 'the in the foreground in the you know', 'space between you and the cosmos that is', 'made in the astrophysics is actually the', 'same material that makes up meteorites', 'and I brought some meteorites for you', 'guys here. So dust is ubiquitous and the', 'same type of dust that obscured our', 'measurement and prevented me from', 'winning a Nobel prize is actually the', 'same stuff that the planets are made of', \"and so it's identical to that happens to\", 'be magnetic and it produces radiation', 'and heat and so we saw it and we', 'misinterpreted it as the signal from the', 'baby produces um infrared infrared and', 'microwave emission. Yep. So Jin Simons', \"upon hearing this he's like well what do\", 'we do and then when we retracted the', 'claim that we had detected inflation', 'humiliating this is a hum this is not', 'like an easy thing to do still he said I', 'want to go for the signal more than ever', 'now but we have to remove the dust so', \"it's a good thing like you said Chuck\", \"it's actually a good thing when you make\", 'a mistake you say oh I got to refine', \"what I do it's like you go out to your\", \"car there's dust on the windshield I got\", \"to clean the windshield no except you're\", 'not going out to the uni the galaxy and', \"removing the dust you're removing the\", 'dust signature in your data exactly how', 'do you do that without a vacuum cleaner', 'or a dust devil, you need ways to do', 'that. Exactly. So, so what Jim was was', 'wise about and what David Spurggle had', 'figured out cuz he was one of the ones', 'that killed off the bicep', 'interpretation. He figured out we need', 'to have multiple colors of light. Bicep', '2 only had one color of light. We', \"couldn't see multiple colors. And when\", 'you have multiple colors, you learn', 'about the spectrum. You learn about the', \"characteristics. So, what Simon's\", 'Observatory now does and why Jim funded', 'that is it can see the cosmic signal. If', \"it's there, we have to assume it may not\", 'be there just because we want it to be', 'there, but it can also see the dust. And', 'when you have the signal, you have the', 'cosmic signal plus the dust signal. We', 'have a telescope that just saying in', 'your one band of light. Exactly. You', 'could not distinguish the cosmic signal', 'from the local signal. In two bands of', 'light, they each will show up', \"differently in two bands. And now you'll\", \"be able to identify. And now you've been\", 'able to take it and take it out. But', \"that's not what I remember most about\", 'this episode. I I remember the ambulance', 'chasing theorists who came behind this', \"false result, thinking it's real, coming\", 'up with an explanation so they can get', \"their Nobel Prize, too. That's right.\", \"Wow. That's what I remember. I got email\", 'like 100 theories. How many theories?', \"Well, there's 1,800 papers published\", \"about it's my most cited paper,\", 'embarrassingly enough. Um but yeah so so', 'it was it led to so this this this', 'disaster in some sense led to the you', 'know initiation of this new most', 'powerful instrument ever made to do the', \"cosmic micro background and that's\", \"that's the science observatory science\", 'of which you are PI congratulations', \"thank you very much yeah that's very\", \"cool that's a great story we got we got\", 'to get to oh he should write a book', \"about it we're all familiar with\", 'Polaroid sunglasses', 'and some subset of those who own', \"know what they're doing, but I think\", \"most people don't. It's just a type of\", 'sunglasses that you want. I always have', 'polarized sunglasses with me in my', 'backpack just cuz you never know when', 'you need to pull you need to hide from', 'the paparazzi', 'and their flash might bounce off of', 'something. So, I need to I need', 'polarizing sunglasses to block out that', 'bounce light. So, so catch us all up on', 'how my polarized observations work.', 'Yeah. So, light has three primary', 'properties. its color spectrum, its', 'intensity, how bright the light is, and', 'also something called its polarization,', 'least familiar property of light. And', 'light is an electromagnetic wave. So', 'when a wave oscillates, the plane that', \"it's oscillating up and down in, the\", 'electric field vectors are going up,', 'down, like that. And the magnetic field', \"vectors are going like that. So it's two\", \"waves. One's going up and down, but the\", \"other sorry to That's right. One's going\", 'up and down, the other one is going side', 'to side.', 'Magnetic electromagnetic.', 'Okay. And when light interacts with', 'matter, you see like a glare. You see a', 'reflection there. Well, what polarized', 'sunglasses do is that they oppress and', 'suppress one of those', \"oppress. Come on. You see, you're\", 'sitting between two people here who take', 'a different understanding of that word.', \"The show does know that one day. That's\", 'right. We going to be able to get', 'through. See the mountain top using the', 'polariz. See the other side.', 'You know, sometimes I just feel tired', \"like I'm tide light. Tired light.\", 'Oh man, we got to get all of this into', 'the B-roll. All right, good. The way', 'that polarized sunglasses work is that', 'they actually suppress one of the two', 'polarization states of light. It happens', \"to be the horizontal one. And that's why\", 'you want to wear them at the beach or', \"you want to wear them when you're\", 'driving because you get that glare or', 'skiing. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.', \"your skin and that's why they're more\", 'expensive because you have to add this', \"film that's has molecules that are\", 'actually made of polymers that actually', 'suppress one of those two states of', 'light but let the rest in because you', \"don't want to be totally dark. Right. So\", 'polarized sunglasses suppress one of the', 'two polarization states of light. They', 'make the light 50% darker. Also in', 'photography called neutral density', 'filter. Exactly. Yeah. So the film', \"that's on these uh on these glasses\", 'actually knocks out one of the two', 'polarization states of light. The one', 'that is responsible for the glare that', 'youare. So that means if you have two of', 'them and if they are oriented just', \"right. Let's try that. So here's some\", 'light coming through. Okay. So this a', 'very expensive demo here. So this is', 'this is actually knocking out half of', \"the light in there cuz only half it's an\", \"unpolarized source. So half of it's\", \"polarized one way, half it's polarized\", 'the other way. The source is', 'unpolarized. And then if you put another', 'polarized source in front of it and I as', 'I rotate it eventually the axis of', 'polarization will be orthogonal and that', 'will block out 100% of the light. Do you', 'see perpendicular? There it is. So now', \"it's completely orthogonal or\", 'perpendicular as as you would say. Uh', 'and then if I as I rotate it slightly', 'the offaxis now lets in some light. So', \"that's how polarization works. That's\", 'why you can see through the glare. It', \"doesn't affect your eyes. It doesn't\", \"hurt your eyes when you're skiing as you\", \"said. Um and so that's what these\", \"instruments are doing. They're looking\", 'for polarization not of optical light', 'but of microwave light from the Big', 'Bang. The leftover heat from the Big', 'Bang. So remember I said inflation.', 'Inflation is this theory that there was', 'this quantum field that fluctuated that', 'produced everything that we know and', 'love about the big bang. It would also', 'produce what are called gravitational', 'waves. Waves in the fabric of spaceime', 'itself. Th those waves would perturb the', 'electrons, the protons, early hydrogen', 'atoms in the universe. When the CMBB or', 'cosmic microwave background was produced', 'about 400,000 years after the big bang', 'when light interacts with matter, as you', 'see from the glare, it becomes', 'polarized. That matter would be polar.', 'that matter in its orientation would', 'change depending on how much', 'gravitational wave energy was present', \"when the CMBB was produced. So it's\", 'actually a gravitational wave detector.', \"We're using the photons of the cosmic\", 'background as a type of film if you will', 'and onto which these waves of gravity if', 'they exist and only if they exist they', 'get they get a polarization to them a', 'curling twisting tw pattern of', 'polarization that called we call it B', \"mode polarization. Wow. So, it's a it's\", 'a lot of logical steps, but actually', \"it's it's very well tested and very well\", \"theorized. It just hasn't been detected\", \"yet. It's quality physics going into\", \"that. Yeah, that's super cool, man.\", 'Yeah, literally. And we have to use we', \"can't use, you know, we can't use an\", 'iPhone. We got to cool our detectors', 'down to my colleague Suzanne Stags at', \"Princeton. Uh she's built detectors that\", 'operate at 0.1 degree above absolute', 'zero, right? Using isotopes of helium', 'and she does incredible stuff and', \"they're superconducting detectors.\", \"They're basically little thermometers.\", 'So, you know, you go outside and not in', 'New York, but in San Diego, you go', 'outside, you can see the sun with your', 'hand. You can basically detect where the', 'sun is using its infrared and that your', 'skin can absorb infrared heat. Well, so', 'too, we can have detectors that can see', 'microwaves and infrared radiation and', \"but they have to operate where it's\", \"really cold. Otherwise, it's like\", 'building, you know, the biggest, you', 'know, James Web space telescope and', \"putting it in Manhattan. And so what's\", 'the fluctuation of temperature that', \"you're looking for between what the\", 'universe has cooled to and what would', 'have been present uh right at the big', \"bang. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly what we're\", \"looking for. So there'll be deviations\", 'in about a part in a billion. So a', 'nanoelvin. So in other words, if if the', 'universe on average is about 2.7 Kelvin,', 'it would be 2.7 plus a nano Kelvin in', 'that direction and 2.7US 1 nano kel. So', \"you're looking at the nth decimal place,\", 'right? So a billionth degree', 'billionthion of a degree above from Wait', 'and somebody gave you money to do this.', \"Wait. So wow. So here's what that's\", 'insane. So let me drive home why we need', 'inflation. Okay. Okay. Because let me', \"tell you why. Okay. Because we're going\", 'through a transition.', \"Okay. In this direction it's 2.7. What's\", 'the Give me a few more decimal places.', \"2.726. It's 2.726 degrees in that\", 'direction in the universe. Okay. And I', \"look in the other direction, right? It's\", '2.76 degrees, right? And and how the', 'hell do they know to be the same', 'temperature as each other to a', 'thousandth of a', 'degree room? Y the temperature', 'fluctuates by degrees. Exactly. By whole', 'degrees. In this corner, that corner,', 'over there, near a lamp. the whole', \"universe is that that's right just one.\", 'And so so what what Guth said was the', 'way to get that to be the case when the', 'universe was small and all talking to', 'itself in equilibrium temperature', 'equilibrium then it quickly expanded', \"right like so fast it couldn't go out of\", 'equilibrium with itself. So it all has', 'the the markings of that same', 'temperature from a bajillion years ago.', \"That's so cool. Hence the justification\", 'for inflation. Yes. Yes. Because all of', 'that expansion all at once, it gives you', 'the uniformity across the entire', 'expansion. Correct. Wow. Correct. Okay,', \"I'm done. We need you to call an\", \"Aquarius. Come back. L2. He's going to\", 'call the steak out. Oh my god. Yeah,', \"that's insane. It is insane. I mean,\", 'that is literally I mean, who thinks', 'like this? Who thinks like this?', \"My god. Wow. That's brilliant. I mean\", \"that's that's that's really So the\", 'inflation explains it. But then we', 'needed a cause for the inflation and', 'they we had to pull that out of our ass.', 'What was that? Basically I mean it', \"results as related to what's called the\", 'multiverse. You know basically without', \"the multiverse you don't get inflation\", 'in most models according to most and', \"that's causes some people like there's a\", \"phase transition right. There's a phase\", 'transition. Yeah. And the the actual', 'dynamics of it can be explained using', 'quantum field theory, which is a theory', \"everywhere in space. There's a quantum\", 'field. Okay, you guys, right now you', 'sound like an episode of Star Trek.', 'Next generation. Next generation. They', 'love phrase phase', \"transitions and let's get to the\", 'questions now. Come on. Okay. All right.', 'Oh, man. I got so excited I put the', 'Hello, Dr. Tyson, Dr. heating uh', '10-year-old Reuben and six-year-old Eli', 'here from Harrisburg, PA. All right.

But in reality, we can', 'answer that question in the affirmative.', 'As you actually hinted at, there could', 'have been a universe that existed', 'beforehand that actually collapsed and', 'what we used to call a big crunch.

Captain, how do they', 'punctuate that?', \"Uh so uh so the actual answer is we're\", 'trying to determine not what happened', \"because in science you can't prove\", 'something happened like you can prove 1', 'plus 1 equals 2 or 1* 1 equals two as', 'you tell our mutual friend Terrence uh', \"but but in reality we can't prove a m a\", 'physical fact but we can falsify', 'alternative models.

So eventually it', 'will get into the radio waves but you', 'know keep paying your taxes because', \"that's going to take billions of years.\", 'Universe has to go expand by more than a', 'factor of 10 from where it is now which', 'could take more than a factor of 10', 'times the age of the universe because', 'the wavelength 10 times bigger is', 'basically when we start calling it a', 'radio wave. Okay. So the universe has to', \"be 10 times bigger because it's\", 'stretching into the universe. Exactly.', \"That's so cool. So the answer is yes.\", \"Yeah. Yeah. You're just not going to see\", \"it, buddy. I don't know if you want to\", 'spend money on the on the trademark of', 'that, right? But but but just to', 'clarify, before it was the cosmic', 'microwave background, it was the cosmic', 'visible background. Yeah.

And with a cosmic x-ray', 'background and then gamay background.', \"That's right. Yep. There you go. Okay. I\", \"love it. Hey Star Talk fans, I don't\", 'know if you know this, but the audio', 'version of the podcast actually posts a', 'week in advance of the video version and', 'you can get that in Spotify and Apple', 'Podcast and most other podcast outlets', 'that are out there. Multiple ways to', 'ingest all that is cosmic on Star Talk.', 'This is uh yog who says, \"Hello Lord', 'Nice Dr. Keing and my personal', 'astrophysicist I love that uh yogas from', 'Nagpur India. My question is, is the', 'CMBB anisotropy really random? For those', 'who may not know, what is anisotropy?', 'Means not isotropic, right? That makes', 'sense. And why would it be and then not', \"just why isn't it just a a isotropic ac?\", 'Okay. So, so tell me about isotropy.', 'Yeah. So, isotropy is the feature that', 'you have complete uniformity and things', 'look the same and they are the same', \"homogeneity. It's similar in position in\", 'every direction that you look which way', \"you point the telesc. So if you're ever\", \"flying on an airplane and you're in the\", 'cloud, you go through a cloud. You go', 'through a cloud. Yeah. And that cloud to', 'you when you look out the window, it', 'looks perfectly isotropic. Anywhere you', \"look out the window. And if you're in\", \"the same brightness, it's the same\", \"bright. It kind of looks like you're\", 'inside of a ping-pong ball. Everything', 'is the same brightness and intensity.', \"That's isotropic. That's perfect\", 'isotropy. The principle of looking the', 'same everywhere. But anisotropy just', 'means fluctuations from that from that', \"amount. So it's not that. It's not that.\", \"in one sp one space you'll see something\", 'different than you look in the other', \"space. That's right. Now, if the\", 'universe were perfectly symmetric at', 'earlier times, the amount of matter was', 'the same everywhere. The amount of dark', 'matter was the same everywhere, any', 'exotic particles, everything was exactly', 'identical, the universe would have no', 'way to know where it should form a', 'cluster of galaxies, a single galaxy, a', 'planet, etc., etc., right? So if you had', 'perfect isotropy and Isaac Newton', 'realized this 300 plus years ago,', 'perfect isotropy is incompatible with', \"our existence because we don't see\", 'perfection wherever we look. We we', 'aspire to we also know that and that', \"there's clumps of of dark matter but we\", 'know that we know exactly exactly. So', \"it's kind of what's called we are clumps\", 'of matter. We are clumps of matter', 'ourselves. So the questions is asking', 'why what is that significant of? And', \"it's basically related to the fact that\", 'we formed in a region where there was an', 'excess of dark matter. Where did that', 'excess of dark matter know where to', \"coagulate though? That's where inflation\", 'comes in because all fields, all quantum', 'fields have tiny fluctuations in them.', \"They're not, they are not isotropic\", 'either. Quantum physics enable this', \"universe. That's right. We are quantum\", 'fluctuation. We are the product of', 'quantum if inflation is right. We', \"shouldn't presuppose that it is. We're\", 'looking to see if there is or not. So', 'yeah, so that those pools of dark matter', 'knew where to coagulate because of the', 'fluctuations in the quantum field. So', 'now these fluctuations are they', 'disruptions in the field itself that', 'create something pops out of the field', \"and that's the so the universe itself is\", 'it just one big field', 'according to some according to some that', 'the that the universe is an a particular', 'instantiation of these conditions of our', \"quantum field in what's called the\", 'multiverse. When we were kids, there was', \"just a universe. Right now, there's a\", 'multiverse, which some say should be', \"more encompassing. Just as we know we're\", \"just one star, one planet, there's one\", 'many, many billions of galaxies. There', 'could be trillions or an infinite number', 'of universes. But where do they inhabit?', 'They inhabit the multiverse. The', 'multiverse is the collection of all', 'points in four-dimensional spaceime and', 'maybe higher spacetime that could ever', 'will exist. So, yeah. So, we are a', 'fluctuation in that greater space.', \"You're absolutely right. And then within\", \"those fluctuations, it's like waves in\", \"the ocean. They're waves upon waves upon\", 'waves and we are the manifestation of', 'this infinite series of wave trains that', 'perhaps dates back to the big bang', 'itself. So Chuck, as insulting as it', 'sounds to accuse someone of being a', 'fluctuation is actually quite the', 'compliment,', 'cosmically speaking. Look at that. All', 'right, good question there for just a', 'couple more. All right, this is Brandon', 'Christian. Brandon Christian says,', '\"Hello, Dr. Tyson, Lord Nice, Dr.', 'Kading.\" This is Brandon from New', 'Jersey. My question today is do we have', 'any idea what could possibly be on the', 'other side of the CMBB? Would it be', 'considered a part of our universe if we', 'were to discover it or would it be', 'something else altogether? Ah okay. So', \"the CMBB is the shell of photons. It's a\", \"it's a it's a fictitious shell of\", 'photons that are coming to us from a', 'particular event. What do you mean', 'fictitious? How does that word show up', \"in your send? Well, because it's it's an\", \"artificial um it's a non there's no\", 'place you can go where the CMBB is,', 'which is what the question is asking,', 'right? The CNB is a representative of an', \"event that occurred. It's the event at\", 'which the very first electrons fused', 'with the very first protons making the', 'very first atom hydrogen. When that', 'happened, the universe became', 'transparent to those waves of light that', 'were existing beforehand. Those waves of', 'photon then can free stream and come', 'towards our telescopes. They come in all', \"directions. So, it's a moment. As you\", \"look back in space, you're looking back\", \"in time. So, it's a moment in time. And\", 'it looks like a shell to us. We look out', 'and we see a shell of photons. A little', 'bit hotter here, a little bit colder', 'there, but on average 2.726° Kelvin', 'above absolute zero. There tiny', 'fluctuations in that. So, beyond that', 'just means earlier in time. So, yes,', 'there were things earlier in time, but', 'it was a pretty boring life. It was a', 'pretty boring before that 200 nearly', '400,000 years before that. Yeah. So for', '400,000 years there was nothingness', 'except for there was protons and', 'neutrons and plasma and so forth and and', 'electrons but there was no cosmic event.', \"There's no place there's no there there.\", 'Well the universe was just glowing at', 'these different temperatures. Exactly.', 'It was a plasma. It was a almost uniform', 'plasma. Okay. Expanding cooling and then', 'shifting and waveling. Red shifting and', 'wave. There you go. Wow. All right.', 'Super cool. This is 1701 Cara who says', 'greetings from Tennessee Dr. Tyson and', 'Comrade. Nice. Why you got to make me', 'Russian?', 'I have a cosmic query regarding the Higs', 'field. Is the current model of the Higs', 'field evenly distributed or could there', 'be areas in spaceime where the field is', \"more dense? Uhhuh. That's a great\", 'question. I like that. Could that mean', \"that it's giving different masses to\", 'particles over here than over there?', \"Wouldn't that be wild? That'd be a\", 'messed up universe though.', 'What mass are you?', 'today or yesterday, right? So, a good', 'friend of mine, Matt Straler, guys', 'should have him on.

I love it.', \"That's You'd be surprised how many books\", 'have the word impossible. So, the Higs', \"field is what and that's why it's\", 'impressive. Most people talk about the', \"Higs Bzon. That's not what's so\", 'fundamental. The Higs Bzon is just one', 'instantiation, one creation moment of a', 'particular fluctuation of this field', 'called the Higsfield. Yes, it could vary', 'from time to time. And the most exciting', \"thing is that it's what's called a\", \"scalar field. I don't want to get too\", \"technical, but there's that's the first\", 'and only scalar field that we know', \"about. The other one that's postulated,\", 'but not known yet to exist. We hope we', 'can, you know, shed some light on it, no', 'pun intended, is the inflaton field.', \"Those are scalar fields. They don't have\", 'what are called vector properties.

You know, uh\", \"30 degrees Celsius. It's kind of hot\", \"over here. You know, I'm talking it gets\", \"even hotter. But the the point is it's a\", 'number at every point. But the Higs', 'field is a special case like that. The', 'other types of field like firmians,', 'quarks and other types of of fields in', 'photon fields, they are not. They have a', 'sort of direction at each point in', 'spaceime. So the like a gravitational', 'field has a value and a direction that', 'it wants to pull you. Right. So so this', 'just has a value. Exactly. Okay. Okay.', 'Yep. So why do we care about that? Um so', 'if it did vary, it could be connected', 'the two the Higsfield and the Infotton.', 'So that would be really exciting. It', 'would say that the particle the field', 'that is responsible for giving inertia', 'and mass to massive particles was in', 'existence and coupled somehow to the', 'origin of the universe itself. So maybe', \"there's some connection between the\", 'masses of all particles that were are or', 'ever will be and and this initial phase', 'of the universe called the inflation.', \"Something we haven't figured out yet\", 'because the the all the masses look', 'pretty random. Yeah. Yeah. We have no', 'fundamental theory that predicts of the', 'masses of particles in the universe.', \"Exactly. That's a great question. All\", 'right. Eric Venus and he says, \"Yes,', 'like the planet and the', 'goddess.\" He says, \"I understand that as', \"we look further into the universe, we're\", 'looking further back in time.

possible', 'and then that goes to a central place', 'and then you can have people there that', 'can', 'coate the and correlate the data and we', 'said just try to make everything public', \"so you're

not', \"want to do anything that's really a\", \"shame but at least it's it's on the\", \"radar y that it's something to do money\", 'then becomes available okay in a way', \"don't you think that's a

on', \"it we don't quite so ball lightning I'm\", 'not expert on this my understanding is', \"it's still not well understood okay okay\", \"so there's you know there is stuff out\", 'there that like

we', \"that we're doing right now here on Earth\", \"here on Earth M so in space if it's a\", 'vacuum what exactly is the shock', \"traveling on good question yeah there's\", 'always a little bit of

once', 'we had the large hydron collider going', 'MH in Switzerland the CERN CERN yeah mhm', 'so from the rates of you know the', \"bajillions of collisions that they're\", 'doing there uh we were

that', \"they shouldn't make it that trip from\", 'the top of the atmosphere down to here', 'they should Decay before they H before', 'they hit the earth then why do they make', \"it well because

are muons with negative', 'charges electrons have negative charges', \"um but if you leave a muon alone it'll\", 'Decay and you you can get an electron', 'from that um so in a way you could you',

we have a hierarchy of words and', 'how do they correspond to hierar of', \"energy is that what you're trying to say\", \"that's what I'm trying to say like how\", 'how would you explain like okay so in', 'Nova is like 10 nuclear bombs or five', 'hydrogen bombs or whatever just so that', 'we could like I wish I had that number', \"but I think it's more of those bombs\", 'than I could I could could ever even', 'imagine more bombs you can imagine that', 'is dope I mean you get 10 to the 53 ergs', 'from a what we call a type two Supernova', \"explosion so that's a massive star\", \"that'll explode and end up as a black\", \"hole right that's like a factor of 10 to\", 'the 20 more than a Nova just a little a', \"little 10 20 more yeah yeah it's a huge\", 'difference fact it in that explosion', \"correct me if I'm wrong it's emitting\", 'more energy than all the stars in the', \"galaxy in which it explodes yeah that's\", \"something I mean I think that's right if\", 'the Sun is 10 of 33 ergs per second and', \"it's 10 of 53 total URS yeah so that's\", '10 to the 20th more URS the the the one', \"that I've heard is if you add up all the\", 'energy that the sun will ever emit in', \"its all in its total lifetime that's\", \"like a supernova that's a supernova yeah\", \"gocha right it's huge yeah that's almost\", 'the same way to all at once all at once', \"you're looking at 10 billion 15 billion\", \"years of radiation po all at once that's\", \"and that's what so they're visible\", 'Across the Universe so how far away are', 'your objects are they all in our own', \"galaxy everything that I've been\", 'studying lately has been in our own', \"Galaxy but I've also studied other\", 'galaxies but nearby ones mostly but now', \"I've just started getting into Galaxy\", 'clusters um but still nearby clusters', \"okay but they're getting kind of far\", \"away now let's just take a moment as we\", 'record this MH in the year 2024 yes that', '100 years ago yes Hubble the man not the', \"telescope discovered that we're not\", 'alone as a galaxy in the universe wow', \"yeah ended the great debate no he didn't\", 'do the debate no he ended it ended it', 'the end of the great debate okay the', 'great debate was are the spiral nebula', 'just local phenomena in our own Galaxy', 'or they whole other whole other galaxies', 'whole other galaxies out there like ours', 'Island universe and now now we know', \"there's a whole trillion of them out\", \"there yeah yeah that's amazing they got\", 'out of control look at that so you', 'mentioned Amery just a moment ago as the', 'the nutrino the was he the Namer of the', 'nutrino he must', \"Italian yeah it's exactly how he said it\", \"too I believe I have a discovery it's\", \"got a nutr exact that's Chuck speaking\", \"Italian as by the way that's yeah that's\", \"every American who's not Italian\", 'speaking Italian and if they were girl', \"neutrinos they'd be nutras right\", \"wouldn't they that's very cool yeah now\", \"I'm\", 'interested so we tend to name telescopes', 'after scientists or other people', 'relevant to our field and I read', 'recently about the fmy telescope and I', \"don't know anything about it could you\", \"catch me up on it yeah so it's a Gamay\", \"it's the Gamay Space Telescope Space\", 'Telescope yeah M you got to be in space', 'because gamma rays will interact with', \"the Earth's atmosphere so and give you\", 'muons yeah yeah and pons and the whole', \"gam yeah good stuff uh so it's in space\", 'is this the first Gamay telescope Space', 'Telescope it is not uh so its', 'predecessor was the Compton Gamay', \"Observatory I knew that okay it's the\", 'size of a bus it was a really big one', \"cuz that it's a bus that fits inside the\", \"space shuttle yeah so just yeah so it's\", \"not that it just fit in it's designed to\", 'just fit', \"in that's your size make it fit yeah\", \"that's that's your whole payload that's\", \"the whole that's the whole payload right\", 'there at the time and it may still hold', 'the record it was the heaviest thing', 'that the shuttle ever launched really', 'wow okay but you need a heavy detector', 'like that to stop the gamma rays you', \"know to detect them it's it's in essence\", 'the firmy gam Space Telescope is a', 'particle detector okay but it could also', \"know what direction it's coming from\", \"right that's right so it it detects when\", \"a photon comes in and it's one Photon at\", 'a time G Photon so one phot when the', 'photon comes in uh where it came from as', \"best as it can you're counting one\", \"Photon at a time one at a time that's\", 'insane they rare you this is the highest', 'energy stuff you need you need something', \"special to create it and so yeah they're\", 'pretty rare man they just just dish', 'amount just here here one for you man', 'one for you one for you we got a photon', \"guys guys they're looking over here let\", 'me TOS one to those to', \"those that's pretty wild man I mean when\", 'you talk to solar astronomers oh gosh', \"you can't even have a conversation yeah\", 'because they have like countless photons', 'coming from the Sun even us just from', 'anything from a star you get countless', \"photons you know so uh these this it's\", \"they're precious one Photon at a time\", 'okay so what will it do that the Compton', \"Observatory couldn't do firmy was a\", 'great Improvement on that localization', 'like figuring out what the Direction was', 'uh so it could pinpoint the direction of', 'the gamma ray much better that was', 'really important cuz I think there', \"there's whole generations of detectors\", 'where they just detect something MH', \"right and there's no information as\", 'where it came from it just detected it', 'right right and it was even worse with', 'with with Compton because the you you', 'would really like to say oh we detected', 'a Gamay from this crazy Source but you', \"couldn't quite pinpoint did it really\", 'come from that crazy Source or not your', 'uncertainty Circle was huge exactly yeah', \"okay so now you're doing a little better\", 'oh a lot better yeah yeah yeah uh to you', 'know a fraction of a degree it still', 'sounds pretty sloppy so Observer that', 'you are m space telescopes have high', 'value to you being above the atmosphere', 'oh yeah detecting your one particle a', \"year or whatever your one Lu it's more\", \"than that okay I'm happy to hear how\", 'many total Gamay photons have you', \"touched in your life oh that that's been\", 'plenty plenty okay yeah uh like I was', 'saying before and anytime one of those', 'cosmic ray protons hits an ambient', 'proton and the Galaxy is full of those', 'gas clouds um they light up oh God okay', \"yeah so it's a actually it's a strong\", \"background it's a strong backgr okay all\", 'right so you use the the fery telescope', \"in what way I've lately been studying\", \"well things that you can't detect oddly\", \"enough um so there's there's all these\", \"different Gamay you're detecting it with\", \"gamma rays mean you think you can't\", 'detect with a regular telescope no no', 'you can there are are right sources of', 'Gamay like pulsars and star forming', 'galaxies and things like that but you', 'know if you look at all the pulsars that', \"are out there there's about 5,000 or so\", 'that have been detected in the radio and', 'many of them are detected as Gamay', 'sources as well but only a couple of', 'hundred about 300 H so what are the', 'other 4,000 or so doing we suspected', 'that they would also be good sources of', 'gamma rays and so we were looking at all', 'the gamma ray just a weaker Source yeah', 'yeah so we were looking at all the', 'undetected pulsars and gamma rays and', 'stacking that signal together to see if', 'as a population they actually are gamma', 'ray sources and uh trying to trying to', 'you know figure out what their', 'properties you are improving the signal', \"to noise of your data yeah exactly it's\", \"the signal compared to the noise we're\", 'trying to reduce the background so every', 'time you stack the noise slowly cancels', \"itself because it's not additive right\", 'the ups and the Downs cancel you have a', \"signal however low if it's really there\", \"every next time you're gonna boost it\", \"it's Amplified it's Amplified and every\", \"next time you're gonna Tamp down the\", 'noise right in real practice with a', 'particle detector like this the', 'background just always adds up too it', 'does oh man but you do get a persistent', 'additional signal from your Source', 'population so we stack them both you', 'have to beat it you have to beat it yeah', 'we stack them both okay uh stack the', 'background compare it to our targets and', 'then we we get a signal above the', 'background yeah okay and so so in the', 'inventory of objects or phenomena that', 'are in these cataloges that emerge from', 'the Stacked data is it something other', 'than a pulsar or supernova or are you', 'discovering new kinds of objects maybe', 'because Pulsar is at very low gamy', 'luminosities some people say they', \"shouldn't do that and we're discovering\", \"that we're seeing them that these low\", \"spin down they're called low spin down\", 'uh pulsars are actually potential', \"sources of Gamay emission U so there's\", \"just a lot that we don't know about the\", 'Gamay production of pulsars it comes out', 'in a wacky area of their magnetosphere', 'and does it feel good when Sor can you', 'just just for the sake of the people who', 'may not know cuz I know for others yeah', 'for the other people like what is a', 'pulsar and why is it so important when', 'you talk about spin yeah so a pulsar is', 'um uh the densest kind of object in the', \"universe that we can measure it's all\", \"the it's all the superlatives like that\", \"right it is the densest we're talking\", 'something a couple of times the mass of', 'the Sun but the size of Queens okay so', \"super compact wild can't go any more\", 'compact or you get a black hole Queens a', \"burrow of New York City so it's for\", \"international it's a black hole that you\", 'can actually observe or right before a', 'black hole that you can actually observe', 'exactly yeah so super dense because of', 'that it has an incredibly high surface', 'gravity right so like 100 trillion times', \"the surface gravity that's keeping us in\", 'our seats right now oh so if you weighed', \"a pound right right here you'd weigh a\", '100 trillion pounds on the surface of a', \"neutron star you'd be flat as a flat\", \"exactly right you'd be a g spot spot\", \"that's all not even a flapjack just a SP\", 'not even a', 'tortilla be a little spot but then they', \"pulse right this pulsing is that they're\", 'spinning around really super crazy fast', 'also some of the fastest spinning things', 'they spin faster than a blender okay', 'double the mass of the Sun the size of', 'Queens size of Queens spinning faster', \"than a blender yeah wow yeah it's pretty\", 'nuts spinning so fast they could almost', \"fly to pieces I mean they're they're\", \"it's that fast because of that fast Spin\", 'and that high compression they have', 'these powerful powerful magnetic fields', 'like trillion times higher than the', \"magnet that's on your fridge and that\", 'generates these intense electrical', \"Fields that'll accelerate particles just\", 'like the particles at the particle', 'accelerator particle accelerator the', 'universe as a particle accelerator look', 'at that and

surface despite that high gravity', 'they get shot off at almost the speed of', 'light because of the intense Electric', 'magnetic fields look at that so that', 'means we understand gamy burst is that', \"what you're saying that's a stretch but\", 'all right so a gamy burst is a different', 'thing so this is this is uh during a', 'stellar explosion like a supernova', 'something happens as the core of that', 'star collapses and then anytime a', 'scientist says something happens yeah', \"right we're gapping GA ignorant there's\", 'a whole ignorant Valley there right', \"there's a whole world inside of\", 'something happens well people are', 'modeling it and getting pretty good at', \"it there's a student in our group a\", \"master student who's been doing these\", \"Gamay uh burst explosions but master's\", 'degree', 'yeah not just a master of the universe', 'or Master Class kind of cool though', \"master degree student yes that' be the\", 'degree they should give you as an', 'astrophysicist you are now a master of', 'the universe that I am in favor of', \"change that for sure well let's let's\", 'look at our Cosmic queries and see what', 'came in Chuck you have them all I have', 'them right here you got them all Bring', \"It On yeah well let's start with uh\", 'Haywood from Atlanta Georgia says', \"heywood's asked before I think Heywood\", 'yeah he says hello', 'Chuck uh just wondering do Gamay bur', 'start slowly and build over time or are', 'they instantaneous and by that I think', 'he means not the actual', 'explosion but the leadup to because', \"there's no such thing as a slow moving\", \"burst right it wouldn't you wouldn't\", \"call it a burst you wouldn't call it a\", 'burst at that point so leading up to the', 'actual you know expulsion of what you', \"just talked about what's that process do\", 'we have an idea of what that process is', \"yeah yeah so it's the the collapse of a\", 'massive star down to a black hole', 'presumably um but then instead of just', 'like this spherical explosion that you', \"might picture um it's actually uh you\", 'get a jet couple of jets of explosive', 'material basically that that blast out', 'of the star and they tend to be those', 'Jets tend to be pointed right at us and', 'that gives you um a lot of that that gam', 'that high energy emission once it breaks', 'out of the Star right but it seconds it', \"seconds it's a pretty really rapid rise\", \"and then there's a slight fade but it's\", 'still seconds maybe tens of seconds and', 'those are so-called long Gamay bursts', 'there are shorter ones that are much', \"much quicker tens of seconds and that's\", 'the longest wa wait so how do you know', \"it's that short has anyone witnessed\", 'that yeah yeah we see the light curves', 'of their their explosion and then the', \"the so somebody's looking at it before\", 'it explodes and then they see it while', \"it's exploding in those tens of seconds\", 'even though the sky is vast and we not', 'not enough astronomers in the world to', 'look at every Star at all times but you', 'had people looking at the right star at', 'the right time well not just people the', 'fmy gam Space

properties of the molecular', 'clouds definitely determines how it all', 'plays out wow and do the uh any of these', \"other phenomena like I don't know the\", 'Collision of black holes or these pulsar', 'ejections and all of these particles', 'that are excited and then jetted Across', 'the Universe do they ever perturb these', 'other you know like clouds and things to', 'cause something that we can observe or', \"you know it's interesting when you're\", 'talking about black holes and this and', \"that I was I'm I'm rolling in my head\", \"I'm like no no no no but the cosmic rays\", \"that we've been talking about they can\", 'penetrate into the molecular clouds', 'deeper than anything else okay and', \"provide a source of heat and what we've\", 'noticed is that molecular clouds are a',

that', 'Source okay and this is one of the', 'things that keeps me going in cosmic ray', 'astrophysics is is seeing what the', 'contribution of cosmic rays are to', 'Galaxy Evolution and uh molecular

uh here's a question from beautiful\", 'Portland Oregon from The Limited', 'knowledge uh gamma is the highest Photon', 'energy we have encountered in the', 'universe but we have also produced',

there\", 'sources out there that work A Thousand', \"Times Higher thousand times yeah we're\", 'getting cosmic rays and and uh there', \"there are gamma rays that we're seeing\", \"from from sources

doing your\", 'thermonuclear Fusion yes and we talking', \"about hydrogen burning right that's\", \"hydrogen burning so that's what the sun\", 'is doing yeah burning hydrogen and', \"creating helium right so it's helium\", \"helium so what's what's the big fat guy\", 'doing so they have enough Mass to', 'compress the core to higher temperatures', 'so that they can burn helium into carbon', 'oh or even better burn carbon into', 'oxygen oh or even better the next one', 'and the next one and the next one until', \"you get up to iron so they're just\", 'making all these elements yeah as they', 'burn yep whoa', 'nucleosynthesis', 'nucleosynthesis so that is not just a', 'part of the dying process before they', \"become explode that's the living proc\", 'the living process interesting yeah and', 'that each one of those is very energetic', 'process so they burn fast and so even', 'though you know they have more mass and', 'so you would think oh with more fuel in', \"the tank you'd last longer no they they\", 'burn it up really really fast way fter', \"yeah they're super luminous I mean they\", 'could be um thousands of times uh more', \"luminous than the Sun and so they're\", \"shining they're giving off energy that\", 'much faster now does the size compensate', 'for the longevity or do they just burn', 'out quicker they burn out quicker oh', 'they might only last 10 million years oh', 'yeah instead of a trillion right yes', 'yeah so this is why when Star', \"formation's happening massive star\", \"formation it's instantaneous if you see\", 'a massive there are no old massive stars', \"look at that they just aren't it's\", 'better to burnout than it is to fade', 'away', \"what's that from that's that's that's\", 'Highlander no I yes there another one', \"really that's Highlander that has two\", \"catchphrases it's not there can be only\", 'one that that is the number one', 'catchphrase but the anti-hero in the', \"movie that's his line it's better to\",

'in school at the same time What was the', 'most advanced technological equipment', 'that you had at your disposal when you', 'were in school cuz that will give people', 'really I got one for you ready at the', \"time you were able to visit someone's\", 'house dial a set of numbers to forward', 'your phone number to their phone number', 'so that if someone was calling you at', 'home they could

'your phone number follow you correct', \"call you could you're forwarding your\", 'own calls to you correct Rick what do', 'you have an opinion on this you you', 'could connect to the from your home you', 'could connect to the computer on campus', 'by dialing literally dialing a phone', 'sticking it into a box that had two ear', 'muffs to connect your phone receiver so', 'the handset of the phone

school kids gave them this in', 'fantastic uh experience that was', 'formative in our careers and uh so many', 'of those students became professors and', 'professional', 'astrophysicists um anyway so uh it was a', \"super opportunity and uh and I haven't\", 'stopped since that was a research', \"project in that camp that's right that's\", 'right okay so so I attended the same', 'camp but not at the same time not at the', \"same time but we didn't know each other\", 'at the time we get into graduate school', 'and we find out that the two of us plus', 'another person in our class in that

the\", 'observatory of Tu bra oh Tu BR Tu bro', \"that's your buddy that's my man you like\", 'that he got all the data on the planets', 'and so it was a camp and we lived', 'nocturnally we slept

of your affection for Pluto', 'is Rick made correct me if I got this', 'wrong he made the first', 'measurement of the light dimming of', \"Pluto's moon going in front of and\", 'behind Pluto so Sharon transiting Pluto', 'correct and that was the best evidence', 'available at the time that the moon even', \"existed amazing and then isn't isn't\", 'that what allowed people to calculate a', 'true mass for Pluto and and its size and', \"all this that's right Neil uh when you\", 'have a body in space unless you have', 'something orbiting around it um you know', \"you use Kepler's Third Law to to\", 'calculate the mass of the primary of the', \"mass of the system what's Cap's Third\", 'Law please dude why do we have to', 'explain that to you just because you', 'know oh for other people you want other', \"people to know about no not me I'm just\", 'saying some people might be wondering', \"what Kepler's Third Law is all right so\", \"Kepler's thirdd Law is a relationship\", 'between the orbital period of um of an', 'object compared to the mass or the mass', 'of the primary the mass of the system', 'and so if you can measure the size of', 'the orbit and the orbital period you can', 'calculate the mass of the system we got', 'the mass for Pluto and was way ler than', 'people wanted it to be confess that', 'right now on my show', 'the the mass of Pluto is what the mass', 'of Pluto', 'is let me tell you something Rick you do', 'great in Congress or', \"court that put you on Pluto's radar from\", 'from from Jump Street right there so', 'that so I was not surprised that he', 'turned out to be a staunch Pluto lover', 'his whole life because he he birthed', \"Pluto's mass yeah but by birthing\", \"Pluto's mass you also birth its\", 'demise but go ahead so Neil I was looked', 'at Pluto for five years years I actually', 'spent about 10 or 15 years total working', 'on the Pluto system but we started', 'looking to see if we could detect this', 'Moon around Pluto um about 1980 and um', 'and you know was a fiveyear search of uh', 'looking for these transits and that', \"didn't show up until 1985 and then they\", 'were continuing from about 1985 to 1990', \"uh it's the same technique that we use\", 'for looking at planets around other', 'stars of course Transit exoplanets but', 'this was planetary transits and we we', 'were kind of doing it before it was', 'popular now Rick I you just reminded me', 'of something there was a fuzzy photo of', 'Pluto and there was a little bump on the', 'edge of the what is the circular outline', 'uh just fuzzy a little bump and that', 'that was a hint if we believe the photo', 'and the Emulsion because back when there', 'was authentic photographs right right if', 'we believe that that meant maybe it has', 'a moon and I just I was just reminded', 'that not all transits go exactly in', 'front of the thing you want them to', 'Transit right so if the angle is wrong', \"it's you're not going to see to see so\", \"that's why you were looking for it and\", \"you didn't see it for four years because\", \"our sight line to it wasn't properly\", 'oriented yet is that did you know that', \"at the time what we yeah Neil that's\", \"right I mean what we didn't know is we\", \"didn't know what that angle is or the\", 'inclination of the orbit and so we', \"didn't know when the earth most of the\", 'motion around um the in this case was', \"the Earth's motion around the Sun um we\", \"just simply didn't know what the\", \"inclination of the of sheron's orbit\", \"that's what we call the moon today we\", \"didn't know the inclination of sheron's\", \"orbit so we didn't know when it would\", 'become Edge on to the Earth and um you', 'know but going back to those bumps those', 'were that was 1978 those were on glass', \"plates that's when telescopes we didn't\", \"have ccds we didn't have those\", 'electronic detectors yet back in the', 'day back in the day you had to climb', 'uphill in the snow both ways to get to', \"the telescope now that that's when\", \"that's when telescopes here's what you\", 'did you put your head under a', 'hood damn this old old man hour here', 'okay so anyway those bumps and those', 'fuzzy images would move around and it', 'moved around with about a 6.4 day period', 'which we knew was the rotation period of', 'Pluto so it all made sense but you know', \"we really didn't know it make sure that\", \"it wasn't some funny photographic effect\", 'until we got those transits in 1985 and', 'those first transits were just along the', 'top edge of Pluto along the pole of', 'Pluto and uh so it was the beginning of', 'a long series of these transits that we', 'actually used to make the first maps of', 'Pluto well because you can say how it', 'dims or brightens as Sharon moves across', 'it so you get a blunt understanding of', 'the reflectivity exactly exactly so if', 'it goes across a dark spot the light', \"doesn't change very much but suddenly as\", 'the edge of the moon goes across Pluto', 'and you get a big light drop then you', \"know there's really high albo spot\", 'underneath very cool high albo Alo I', \"love that word yes it's it's almost do\", 'you albo I I albo now you just made it', 'creepy you just made it very', \"creepy it's it's one it's a fun word\", 'that gives no indication of what it', \"means that's true right yeah you would\", 'never know what it was tell tell us', 'about alido Rick albo is a fancy name', 'for reflectivity you know something with', \"a low albo doesn't reflect very much\", 'light and something with a high albo', 'reflects a lot of light so ice is a very', 'high albo a lump of coal has near zero', 'albo a few percent yeah a few percent', 'and and a and a mirror or just a coat of', 'white paint but have very near 100% albo', 'all right this is starting to sound very', \"racist hey Star Talk fans I don't know\", 'if you know this but the audio version', 'of the podcast actually posts a week in', 'advance of the video version and you can', 'get that in Spotify and apple podcast', 'and most other podcast Outlets that are', 'out there multiple ways to ingest all', 'that is Cosmic on Star Talk let me ask', 'you this a long time ago I read this', 'article and I mean it was long ago and', 'it talked about when cuz you just said', 'reflectivity in albo it talked about how', 'uh Pluto was so reflective the way it', 'was that they were able to determine', \"that that's because it was mostly ice\", 'which means it was a lot smaller than', 'they actually thought because what you', 'were seeing was more reflection than you', \"were actual body if you don't know\", 'anything about a cosmic object orbiting', \"the Sun you'll make an assumption of\", 'what its albo might be based on other', 'albos that you have made measured', \"correct that's right that's right so uh\", 'you you make when you first discover', 'something you make a best guess that', \"it's albo or reflectivity and um and\", 'then maybe someday you get the actual', 'measurements and you can refine it so', 'what was your first presumption of the', 'alido of Pluto uh probably around 20 20%', 'okay okay and so given its brightness', \"you would say if if it's that bright and\", \"it's only reflecting 20% of the light it\", 'must be this side okay and so now given', \"that it's has an icy more reflective\", \"surface than previously it's albo jumped\", 'from 20% to what into the 30s maybe up', 'to 40% okay oh W yeah Factor two almost', \"yeah so that's a big deal that's a that\", 'that work all right all right by the way', \"you're in my Pluto book I mention you uh\", \"I don't know if you remember that I\", 'believe the actual words were take that', 'Rick', \"let's go back to asteroids uh a big part\", 'of your career has studied asteroids', 'cool and you were at a conference in', 'Torino', 'Italy where you proposed a way to track', 'how hazardous an asteroid might', 'be and it came to be

just be the Benzel scale since you're\", 'the guy that came up with it why so why', 'so humble man you gota you got to take', 'it while you can get it okay grab the', 'Gusto and the glory like you

And he said, \"I\\'d rather that', 'your measures of space and time are', 'relative than give up the absolute', 'nature of the speed of light.\" Wow. So', 'two, so your very measuring stick', 'changes changes relative to the other.', 'So that you get the same answer. So that', \"you get the same answer. That's that's\", \"that's not your measure stick and your\", \"rate the time ticks that that's crazy.\", \"You get chills a little. So he's Which\", 'drug is he on? I know. Was it opio? What', \"was available at the time? either. He's\", 'not doing ketamine shots. No. Okay, give', \"me more. So, that's two. Um, brownie in\", 'motion. Talk about Give me some brownie', 'emotion. So, if you I mean, I think that', \"feels like a dirty topic. I don't know\", \"if that's appropriate for this. Oh,\", \"actually, I'm not I bet Neil knows why\", \"it was called brownie. There's a guy\", \"there's a guy who first talked about the\", \"statistical observed it but didn't fully\", \"understand it. Mr. Brown, we've all\", 'observed it. So, you go to a window, the', 'dustier the house, the better. You pull', 'the curtains aside and you start to see', 'all the particles move around. They', \"don't fall like rain. They bounce around\", 'the dust particles. Yeah, the dust', 'particles. And you can see the', 'reflection of the dust in the air. You', \"know, it's a kind of a beautiful image.\", 'The sight sunlight hitting reflecting', 'off the dust particles. Dusted apart. I', \"was going to say of grandma's my OCD\", 'like clean. Yeah. Why have you let it go', 'so but we all have had that observation', \"and we all know it doesn't fall like\", 'rain. Mhm. So Einstein also relates this', 'to the quantum nature of matter. He says', 'fundamentally air is not a continuum. If', 'I look at it at the microscopic level,', \"I'm going to realize it's made up of\", 'individual molecules and the molecules', \"are moving randomly because they're\", \"knocking into each other. They're\", 'bouncing around. You call that brownie', 'in motion. So they bounce around', \"randomly because they're kind of\", 'constantly knocking it banging into each', 'other as they move around. And um it was', 'more evidence for the quantum nature of', 'of reality in very early. In fact, I', 'think it was one of the first supportive', 'bits of evidence that atoms even exist.', \"That's right. Because you can if you in\", 'other words, you can have a big you use', 'the air dust analogy, but in a in a in a', 'liquid solution, uh if you have a a', \"suspended particle that's larger than\", 'the molecules themselves, the particle', 'sort of moves around in response to the', 'collective energy of all the particles', 'that are around it. And you can', 'calculate what should happen if this', 'liquid is composed of these tiny', 'particles and then you only get this', 'motion when you have atoms doing the', 'constant Yeah. Absolutely. And we talk', \"that's a better word. We we talk about\", 'the temperature in the room all the', 'time, but what that really is is the', 'average of the thermal motions of an', 'awful lot of particles and the', 'statistical behavior later very well', 'predicted by Plunk. And so this was all', 'part of that early era of starting to', 'understand that if I look at a glass of', 'water, it is not a continuum. If I got', 'small enough, it is actually made up of', 'individual molecules. So, and it was in', \"the fourth paper, wasn't there? Um, E=\", \"MC². Oh, that's a pretty good one. Okay.\", 'Yeah. How could I forget about that one?', 'Yeah. Yeah. Which so that was the whole', 'paper. He just wrote E= MC.', 'This has been a busy year.

Well, so Einstein', 'writes down the general theory of', 'relativity which goes beyond special', 'related 10 years later. Okay. Yeah.', 'Takes', 'kind that he wants to describe not just', 'that space and time are relative. Not', 'just that I can rotate space into time,', \"that they're one kind of spacetime, but\", 'also that spacetime itself could maybe', 'curve, stretch, be mutable, respond to', 'matter and energy. That around the', 'earth, the reason why the apple falls', \"from the tree is because it's following\", 'the natural curve in space created by', 'the mass of the earth. This is general', 'relativity. Now, he generalizes the', 'theory away from flat spacetime to', 'curved spacetime. Now once he does this', 'he still cannot predict everything that', \"this theory suggests. It's just\", \"abundant. It's so abundant that today\", 'people are still trying to find', 'solutions from the theory to describe', 'universes. And people came to him a', 'number of different scientists from', 'around the world very international', 'experiment and and over very quickly and', 'over the the next couple of years said', 'you know your theory predicts that the', 'universe is expanding. So other people', \"are studying his theory. They're\", 'imagining what if I have an average', 'distribution of galaxies in there, all', 'this stuff now. But I I smooth it out. I', \"imagine it's it's pretty smooth out\", 'there.

And he he', 'says to himself, I I must have made a', 'mistake in my fundamental equations of', 'general relativity that describe every', 'possible scenario in the universe. And', 'he adds something called the', 'cosmological constant because', 'technically mathematically it was', \"consistent with Einstein's laws. And if\", \"you're being completely thorough, you\", 'would have included this term called', \"this cosmological constant.

I also like', 'the idea that you just like throw that', \"in and be like, I don't know if my\", \"theory is right, but I there's this\", \"magical extra thing and now it's right.\", 'He knew it was mathematically', \"consistent. That's exactly what\", 'he legit. He said, \"Look, maybe nature', \"produces an energy density that's\", 'uniform across space and time and it is', 'an absolute constant and it has this', 'very different property that it actually', 'pushes the universe outward and if I', \"tune it to exactly the right value, I'm\", 'going to balance things and the universe', 'will not collapse and it will be', 'permanent and it will it will exist that', 'way forever. The universe is doing', 'anything at all.\" Right. But the ow it', \"doesn't owe you. Right. The universe is\", \"just there and if it's just there you\", 'got to somehow stabilize it. Yes. So he', 'stabilized the universe with the', 'cosmological constant. There you go.', \"There. Now he has a universe that's\", 'permanent, has lived forever, will last', 'forever, but not so fast because very', 'quickly people study the mathematics of', \"this and they say it's very unstable.\", 'You basically have stood a pencil on its', \"tip on the top of a hill and said it's\", 'stable. I mean you can do it for a', 'second, but it very quickly wants to', 'fall over and begin to do something.', \"It'll fall in one direction or the other\", 'or the other. And the two directions in', 'this case collapse or expansion. Yes,', 'there you go. So, either the universe is', \"collapsing or it's expanding. It does\", 'not want to stay static. And uh he', 'called it his greatest blunder. Now, he', 'made a lot of kind of mathematical', 'mistakes. So, he was not afraid of that.', 'And he was really so experimental and so', 'daring. So, the idea that he even called', 'it a blunder, I think, was because it', 'was a blunder of intuition. Wait, wait,', \"wait. Resistance. Wait, but wait, it's\", \"not a blunder until it's a blunder. So\", 'he puts it in reluctantly and then', 'Hubble comes along later later', 'in the telescope came first. Yes.', 'Edwin Hubble. Yes. Comes along in the', 'same decade discovers that the universe', \"is not static. It's expanding. Mhm. So\", \"now we're okay because that's one of the\", \"signs. That's one of the signs. And so\", \"you don't even need the cosmological\", \"const. You don't even need the\", 'cosmological constant. So he comes along', 'and says look the universe is not', 'dominated by the cosmological constant', \"from what what he could measure. It's\", 'dominated by the galaxies and the', 'galaxies are in fact expanding away from', 'each other. The universe is in fact', 'expanding and um it was a real shock. We', 'had no physical way to understand a', 'force or pressure in the universe going', 'opposite gravity. There was there was no', 'there was no way there was no and then', 'philosophically what is it expanding', \"into? I know that's we haven't got\", \"there. We'll get there. Yeah. But but\", 'you know, at the time Einstein was first', 'doing this, especially 1905, I mean, he', \"didn't know there were other galaxies\", 'out there. I mean, imagine that. We knew', 'about the Milky Way, our our little', 'island of hundreds, the stars in the', 'night sky and that was that. And I mean', \"he imagined I mean but but it wasn't\", 'until Hubble that we identified that', 'some of those objects out there really', 'were first of all other galaxies and', 'that they were all moving away', 'essentially on average and that it', 'looked like the universe was in fact', \"expanding. So at that point he doesn't\", 'need the cosmological constant and then', 'he declares his greatest blunder his and', 'then fast forward to 1998 right and', 'there it is and we discover the', 'cosmological constant operating in the', \"universe. It's measured and it wins a\", 'Nobel Prize for him.', 'No. God damn it.', \"Plus they don't give it to you if you're\", \"dead. All right. No, they don't they\", \"don't announce it might have happened\", \"unless you're alive. But if you die\", 'between the announcement and the award', \"ceremony, then you're okay. Then you're\", 'still', 'hold on. You got to hold on to the', 'announcement. Yeah. If you die, you', \"still get the award, but you're dead.\", 'All right. So, in this sense, what he', 'rejects as a blunder becomes an actual', 'measurement and they get the Nobel Prize', 'for making that measurement. So now the', 'reason why they can measure it even', \"though it's not static, you might think,\", 'oh, they could only measure it if it', 'made the universe static or something.', 'It it actually was very unstable. What', 'it really wants to do is kind of', 'dominate.

So now', \"here's the great great great grand.\", \"Maybe you don't know this one. Okay. He\", 'predicts based on general relativity.', 'Mhm. That if you have an alignment of', 'two objects, one of them will get lensed', 'around it and you get what is called an', 'Einstein ring. Because if two objects', 'are perfectly aligned together, the', 'curvature of space will take that light', 'and spread it into a perfect ring. And', 'so you would see rings around stars in', \"the night sky from another star that's\", \"exactly aligned behind it. Here's the\", 'problem. Mhm. Back then the universe was', 'composed only of stars and stars are so', 'small at those distances. You would', 'never get an exact alignment. So he said', 'this will probably never get observed', 'until we discover whole galaxies out in', \"the universe. And so it's no longer a\", 'point of light. The galaxy has a whole', 'field. So there many places you can be', 'behind a galaxy and still have this', 'phenomenon. So we see gravitational', 'lenses all the time. Yeah. And we we we', \"see it around black holes. That's how we\", 'detected a black hole. We took a picture', 'of a black hole because the light from', 'behind it went above and below and cast', \"the shadow of the black hole. There's no\", 'above or below in space. Went around.', 'You in my office went around.', 'Went', \"around like it's all north.\", 'So that was one that he predicted', 'assumed there would never be found. And', \"then in my lifetime, like while I'm in\", \"graduate school, we'd discover\", 'gravitational lenses cuz people found', 'these objects hanging off the side. I', 'said, \"What is that? Why is a little', 'distorted?\" A whole arc. It\\'s a whole', 'arc. And then he took a spectrum of it', 'and exactly matched the spectrum of the', \"object on the other side. And that's the\", 'splitting of the light around the', \"object. So that's another little crumb\", \"that fell off the dude's plate. Okay. So\", 'tell me about black holes themselves.', 'Yeah. Well, black holes also predicted', 'from his mathematical theory, but not by', 'Einstein. He did not predict. Well, you', \"know, there's it's as I said abundant.\", \"It's endlessly productive. So, black\", 'holes are', 'crumbs yet to be shaped crumbs. Yeah,', 'you have to go at the equations to', 'decide what you want to think about', 'because it describes every possibility', 'imaginable. Once you put matter and', 'energy in, how will space and time', 'curve? So, I could How does that couch', 'curve spaceime? Not a great question.', 'scientifically, not one most people', \"aren't going to spend their time on, but\", \"one guy decided, you know, it's he's on\", 'the Russian front during World War I. Uh', 'Carl, yes. Did he die on the front? He', 'did. He died like six months after I', \"think there's correspondence with\", 'Einstein where he sends him he said, \"I', 'found a very simple solution to your', 'equation.\" Did he die in the front?', 'Because he was busy writing letters to', 'Einstein.

A lot of people back', 'then died of non-bullet injuries.', 'Related. Yeah.', 'So, but he said imagine it was a thought', 'experiment. Imagine you took all the', 'mass of a star and you crushed it to a', 'point and or it could have been a planet', 'or it could have been anything.

I don't\", 'even think Schwarzel believed that there', 'was a way nature would do such a thing.', \"Certainly Einstein didn't. But the math\", 'was sound.

That's really what we mean by\", 'surface gravity gets higher and higher.', 'Yeah. Just gets because the mass is', 'always in front of you. If you think', 'about it like if I go inside the sun,', \"the the gravity drops off because I'm\", 'leaving some of the mass behind.

I mean, staring at this', 'guy. No. Yeah. Well, try to crush a soda', \"can. It's It's nearly impossible to get\", \"past a certain point.

Okay. Can I be clear about like a', 'demo and I want to see at only to a', \"point. You can't make a black hole. No,\", 'not a black hole. Right. Right. Right.', 'Because the the atomic forces will', 'resist. Now, so I have to share this', \"quick story with you. I'm having dinner\", 'with Stephen Hawking and nice flex.', 'And so I was talking about Isaac Newton.', 'Mhm. Where he did not figure out that', 'the solar system was stable using his', 'own equations. Okay. It turns out in the', \"solar system, here's the sun and here's\", \"like Earth going around. You're Jupiter.\", 'Every time I go between the sun and', \"Jupiter, you're saying I'm very big.\", \"So, no, I'm saying you're gashes. I've\", \"been I've been working I've been working\", \"to get to Mars. I'm saying you're you're\", 'bulbous and gaseous. So, Earth comes', 'around and it feels you would tug a', \"little because you're closer here,\", 'right? And then over here and it comes', 'back around. It feels a little tug. So,', 'all these little tugs, he knew that if', 'this continued, Earth would just fly out', 'of its orbit for thousands, millions of', 'years. this would just be this runaway', 'destabilizing force going on in the', 'solar system. And you know what he said?', 'He said God must step in and fix things', \"because I that's how badass he is. He\", 'said my I know my equations do my so the', 'only', 'thing because we see a stable solar', 'system. Okay. But late 100 years later,', '100 years later, Llas comes up with a', 'formalism, a branch of he develops with', 'others, but he develops a branch of', 'calculus. Mhm. That can demonstrate that', 'these little tugs, which are multiple', 'little tugs on a major system, all', \"cancel out. It's called pertabbation\", \"theory. But it's just a branch of\", 'calculus. The dude invented calculus,', \"right? Yeah. So you can't you can't\", 'figure that out. So I asked Hawin I said', \"how come he didn't figure it\", 'out cuz who else are you going to ask if', 'not Stephen Hawking right? So and you', 'waited a very very long time for a Yes I', 'did. Thank you. So so I went on to other', \"conversations. Right. He's like my\", \"entire with his eye blinks. He's\", 'assembling the answer. Wow. And it must', 'have been 20 minutes. 20 minutes later', 'he said something simple and brilliant.', 'He said, \"You can\\'t think of', 'everything.\" That took about that 20', \"minutes to type. No, no, no. You can't\", 'think of everything. And I said, \"That', 'is so beautiful that\" And then he went', 'on to say to follow that with Einstein', \"did not come up with black holes. That's\", \"right. Because you can't think of\", \"everything. Can't think of everything.\", \"And I said that that that's comforting\", 'actually. I mean, an entire industry of', 'scientists have been since still working', \"on Einstein's equations. I got another\", 'one for you. Okay. He wrote a research', 'paper on the stimulated emission of', 'radiation. This is an extraordinary', 'result that you have to kind of be on', \"the inside to appreciate. Okay, I'll\", 'tell you what it is. You ready? So, you', 'have an atom with these energy levels', \"where the electron hangs out. It's in\", \"discrete energy levels. It can't hang\", 'out anywhere. This is quantum. A quantum', \"is units of anything. Okay? So, it's\", 'quantized. Even solace', 'quantum Think about it. If you have a', 'quantum of solids,', 'very marquees somehow. Yes, it is. So,', 'the the electron can only be in any one', 'of these discrete levels at any given', \"time. And if it's at a higher level,\", \"left to itself, it'll want to deexite\", 'back to a lower level. And it shoots out', 'a photon in so doing. So, this is what', 'atoms just want to do. If you excite', 'them, they want to deexite. We got this.', \"Okay. So, let's go back to our atom and\", 'we have an electron hanging out in an', 'energy level. Now, I send in light', 'photons that are exactly the energy', \"level that'll boost this up.

However, oh\", \"no, here's what he discovers. that if\", 'you bathe an atom with an electron at a', 'given level of photons that would boost', 'it, it will also spontaneously trigger', 'it to deexite at the same time.

So, it's\", 'the stimulated emission of radiation.', 'Normally, when you stimulate it, it', 'absorbs it. This one, you shine on it,', 'it deexites.', \"Okay. That's a weird result. Yeah. It's\", 'a quantum result that he deduces using', 'math and quantum physics. Okay. And what', 'do we get out of this? Well, we got', 'lasers. Lasers.', 'You say that so calmly. Lasers. We get', 'lasers. pull your hair, pull some, grab', \"some. So, it's really an interesting\", 'history because there were also masers', 'before lasers, which were microwave', 'versions of this.

Let's from here on let\", 'us call it', 'so so so the laser is an acronym like', 'scuba and all these fun acronyms laser', 'light amplification amplification by the', 'stimulated emission of radiation and', 'those are the three words I did in his', 'paper so so light would be yeah the sir', \"of laser so it' be visible light but you\", 'can it works with any kind of photons', \"microwaves it turns out it's easier to\", 'make a microwave laser microwave', 'amplification by the stimulated emission', 'of radiation So this was this is just', \"some paper he does like while he's\", 'taking a crap. All right, and publishes', \"it and then his boot paper I don't know\", 'if he was actually on experiencing some', 'brownie in motion if you will.', 'So brown a brownie in movement. Yes.', \"Yes. Uh so that for me that's my\", 'favorite is it? Of his crumbs. Of his', \"crumbs. Interesting. I mean it's it's an\", \"unbelievable technological advance. It's\", \"incredible. It's everywhere. Yeah.\", 'Because because the amplification is if', 'you emit light in this bath of light and', 'that light you emit is the same light', 'when brought around that will deexit it', \"and emit a photon. So the so it's it's\", 'almost self feeding. The light that it', 'emits is the same light that it then', 'absorbs. So this this loop is can you', 'you can pump light that way with the', 'right number of molecules in the right', 'cavity. Oh my gosh. And it becomes very', 'coherent and very tight beam and very', \"intense. Yes. So it's a way of getting\", 'like this incredible intensity at this', 'one very narrow frequency range or light', \"range. Yeah. And so at the time I'm sure\", 'he was saying to himself skin peel,', \"right? I was like I'm going to have a\", 'little laser. Yeah. I mean the', 'application of laser were Oh my god. So', 'the pe the people who invented the', 'laser, I think it was Charlie Towns, got', 'a Nobel Prize for that. Wow. Did you', 'expect it to be in like a Walmart? Yeah,', 'I know. At the checkout line. Yeah.', 'Yeah. No, the first lasers were were', \"huge. And so just the idea that here's a\", 'paper that 30 years later becomes a', 'device and the device gets the Nobel', 'Prize. Incredible. Do you know when', 'Towns got the Nobel Prize? So the laser', 'was invented 1956 57 and Einstein died', 'in 1955. Mhm. So he would not so close', 'to seeing the lake. So close. So close.', 'And they were going to operate on him', 'cuz he had some element that was No. No.', 'Stop.', 'And he said he was already in his 70s or', 'something. He said, \"Uh, my work is', 'done.\" Did he really? Yes. I thought', 'that was classy. He was just scared of', 'medical care.', 'I mean, he was still so combative with', \"quantum mechanics. I'm Yeah. He give me\", 'the quote. Which one? The God does not', 'play dice. God does not play dice.', 'was it Neils Boore who said back to him', 'another physicist Einstein stopped', 'telling God what to do. He kept it was', 'one of several times he talked about God', \"and God's intentions because quantum\", 'physics is fundamentally statistical.', \"It's not does not describe a unique\", 'objective reality.

This feels like a trend though', \"because Newton also is like I don't know\", 'God.', 'Yeah, bring a God when you need him. So,', 'a couple of fast other ones. So, he', 'predicts out of general relativity that', 'certain phenomenon should produce', 'ripples in Oh, yeah. space-time', 'continuum. Gravitational waves, right?', 'Gravitational waves. So he says look if', 'the earth can curve spacetime if the if', 'the sun can curve space time so that the', 'earth falls around the sun then if these', 'systems move around the curves have to', 'move too. So the curves themselves have', 'to modulate like waves and he predicted', 'something called gravitational waves', 'which are these silent waves in the', 'shape of spaceime and they are not', \"visible. It's not light. It's pure\", \"gravity. It's not light, but if you saw\", 'something, you could see a bobbing on', 'the wave as its path changed um around a', 'moving object. So, if the sun decides', 'to, you know, do something crazy, we', 'would know eight minutes later when the', 'wave got to us. So, I I think I have', \"this right. There's a cottage industry\", \"rising up in astrophysics where they're\", 'looking at the pulsars in the galaxy.', 'Pulsars are very fast rotating stars', 'that have extremely precise timing.', \"precise. So if there's a gravitational\", 'wave not coming towards us but passing', 'across our field of view, we can see the', 'effect of the turbulent space-time wave', 'on the timing of the pulsar as it goes', 'through the wave and then you can see', \"them move across the universe. They'll\", \"bobble around. They're like buoys on on\", \"the ocean. Yes. They'll just you'll see\", \"this effect as that happens. And so it's\", 'like whoa. So he wrote many papers where', \"he thought they didn't exist. So he\", 'really struggled with whether or not', 'these', \"he had his go right. I don't know black\", 'holes exist but maybe well gravitational', 'waves were really confounding whether', 'they carried energy or were real in a', \"substantive way or was just oh I'm just\", \"changing my coordinates. It's just it's\", \"not physically real. There's no physical\", 'impact. This was confounding for', 'decades. He once would write he he wrote', 'papers where he said they do not exist.', 'They would be accepted for publication', 'and in the space between publication and', 'sending it to press, he would change the', 'entire paper and say they do exist. In', 'the space between it being accepted,', 'yes. Between it being accepted and going', 'into print, he would change the entire', 'conclusion, rewrite the paper and say', 'they do exist. He wants to be writing', 'another papers. Right. Right. Right.', 'Right. So then we decide maybe we can', 'detect some of these. And Kip Thorne,', 'who was a guest on our show, we took', \"Star Talk to him because he's Kip\", 'Thorne. Right. We we moved the mountain', 'to Kip Thorne. We went to his home', \"office in Pasadena. He's a professor at\", 'a emeritus now I think at Caltech and we', 'talked about Interstellar because he was', 'a executive producer on Interstellar. He', \"wrote the original treatment. It's like\", 'his dream idea. He did write the', 'original treatment. He brought on', 'Christopher Nolan to to realize those', \"views. It wasn't the other way around.\", 'So he uh petitions Congress and the', 'National Science Foundation and other', 'agencies to and with a lot of support', 'from other physicists and the like.', 'Right.', 'Yeah. To build Mhm. the first', 'gravitational wave detector. Mhm. And', \"it's built, it's called LIGO, laser\", 'interferometer gravitational', 'observatory, LIGO, sensibly abbreviated,', 'LIGO.

They have the two', 'lasers that go off at right angles and', 'if a wave washes over Earth, the length', 'of one laser path will change relative', 'to the other. They make this', 'measurement. Mhm. Bada bing, they found', 'the first colliding black holes which', 'deposited so much energy into the', 'space-time continuum that it would have', \"we'd have a chance of measuring it.\", 'Yeah. I mean, it was the most powerful', \"event humanity's ever observed since the\", 'observation of the Big Bang itself. More', 'energy came out of this all in', 'gravitational waves in utter darkness.', 'Utter darkness. And yet and that the', 'power was greater than all the stars in', 'the observable universe combined at that', 'moment. So, but it all came out just in', 'ringing space, literally. So, darkness,', 'right? Could not see it with a', 'telescope. And so, think about it. I', 'love the look on your face. Thank you', \"for that. He's looking back and forth\", \"like No, no, this is I'm trying to think\", 'of anything else that would be more', \"powerful than those stars combining. I'm\", 'stuck at Taylor Swift and Travis Kelson.', 'When those stars came together, we all', 'felt it. That was a moment. It was a', 'tectonic ship. So, we discover', 'gravitational waves. Mhm. That won a', 'Nobel Prize.', 'But more so, we discovered gravitational', 'waves using lasers.', 'Okay. His crumbs connected. His crumbs', 'came together and made a big smorgish', 'board of science and physics and Nobel', 'prizes for everybody on board. So, can', 'you get more amazing than that? I mean I', \"don't I didn't The detection was\", 'essentially in the centenery too of', 'Einstein. It was in', '2015 years after his gravitational wave', \"papers. Oh man. Yeah. That's Einstein\", 'has something magic. Einstein totally', 'had something to do with that. Now Janna', 'memory serves Einstein was a big', 'proponent of a unified field theory. And', 'when I first heard that when I was a kid', 'field, what do you mean by field? I', \"didn't know that field was synonymous\", 'with forces. Right? So we have', 'gravitational force, electromagnetic', 'force, which in its day was the electric', 'force and the magnetic force and then', 'the force and', \"I've seen Star Wars.\", 'Maybe they they maybe they figured it', 'out. They got the one force, you know.', 'Uh so with the work of Hinrich Herz and', 'and others we figured out how to combine', 'electricity and magnetism to make one', 'force and we take that word for granted', 'but they used to be two whole separate', 'words electromagnetic force. So Einstein', 'why did he fail at this or what what', \"what was motivating him? Well we've all\", \"failed at this. So okay, so there's\", 'great success in unifying all of the', 'matter forces, all of the quantum matter', 'forces, electromagnetism with the weak', 'nuclear force and the strong nuclear', \"force. That's the whole story of matter.\", 'Done. Completely sealed. Yeah. But', \"they're not there's an outlier. Well, so\", 'the electroeak theory is combined. Weak.', 'So we went from electro electricity,', 'magnetism, and the weak nuclear force.', 'Right. Then we got electromagnetism. And', 'then with my guy from my high school,', 'right? Uh um which guy from your high', 'school?', 'What? Steve Weinberg and Sheldon Glow.', 'They and was his high', \"school. Who's the third one in there? Uh\", \"Salam Salam, right? That's correct. So\", 'the three of them, two of them were', 'classmates in my high school before me,', 'but in my high school. Anyhow, they', 'there was something in the water there.', 'They managed to conjoin the', 'electromagnetic force and the weak force', 'and they called it what? Electroak.', \"Okay, that's not very creative, but all\", \"right, we'll go with it. But it is\", 'pretty magical. It says that those are', 'really one force which is magical.', 'Something that is at nuclear ranges that', 'we do not experience in our everyday', 'life separate forces today. You go back', \"in time there's a point where they were\", 'just one expressed force in the', 'universe. So that gives us electroeak', 'strong force and gravitation. Yeah. Now', 'the strong easily can get in there even', \"though we don't talk about it very much\", 'anymore. What do you mean easily? If you', \"did that you'd have a Nobel Prize now.\", \"So well there's something called the\", 'grand unified theories and and they have', \"certain failures. There isn't like an\", 'ideal grand unified theory, but but', \"really there's nothing barring the\", \"possibility of it. I mean, it's it's\", \"it's no obvious obstacle. There's no\", 'fundamental obstacle to a grand unified', \"theory. Most people think it's going to\", 'come along for the ride when we do the', 'full unification. So, when Einstein said', 'a unified field theory, was he thinking', 'just that or was he also want to include', 'gravity? He wants gravity. He wants', \"gravity. He wants gravity. It's the same\", 'thing he did when he went from special', 'to general. When he started thinking', 'about quantum mechanics, he wants a', 'quantum theory. Gravity behaves so', 'differently from the other forces', 'because you can think of gravity not', 'even as a force but as the just falling', 'down the curvature of space and time.', \"That's geometry. It's geometry. It's not\", 'really a force. So So that could be a', 'barrier to summing these together. Well,', \"it's Nobody's ever succeeded at even So\", 'how about Kip Thorne? Does he have some', 'ideas here? Does he Oh, well I mean Kip', 'has endless ideas. He does. And I and I', 'think Interstellar 2. Yes.', \"I I think Kip's ambition is for yes a\", 'universe that would be completely', 'comprehensible which would mean we', 'either understand quantum gravity or we', 'understand that gravity is not', 'fundamental those are the two kind of', \"choices that everything's quantum\", \"mechanics now I don't know quantum\", 'mechanics is the most successful idea', \"we've ever had about anything in the\", \"universe I don't think any prediction\", 'has ever failed no and and and to the', 'largest number of decimal points of any', 'scientific theory in the history of time', 'whereas general general relativity as', 'badass as it is We know where its limits', 'are. Like at the center of a black hole', 'is a singularity. It gives you a', 'singularity in the equations. And I', \"don't know what that's where they say\", \"where God is dividing by zero. You're\", 'not supposed to divide by zero. Yes.', 'Bad. Well, even Roger Penrose who talked', 'about the singularity in his Nobel Prize', 'of recent years. Even in that paper, he', \"says, I don't really think this part's\", 'going to survive. He really says, uh,', 'quantum mechanics will probably get rid', 'of the singularity. So, it was but it', \"hasn't, but it hasn't done any of the\", 'things it was supposed to do around', 'gravity. The point is more crumbs more', 'crumbs the attention of brilliant people', 'either walk among us or are yet to be', \"born.
