        "Yes thought classy scared medical care mean still combative quantum mechanic 'm\n\nYeah give quote one God play dice God play dice Neils Boore said back another physicist Einstein stopped telling God kept one several time talked God God 's intention quantum physic fundamentally statistical 's describe unique objective reality describes statistical reality felt bad Einstein even though made significant contribution quantum physic feel like trend though Newton also like n't know God",
        "Yeah bring God need couple fast one predicts general relativity certain phenomenon produce ripple Oh yeah space-time continuum Gravitational wave right Gravitational wave say look earth curve spacetime sun curve space time earth fall around sun system move around curve move curve modulate like wave predicted something called gravitational wave silent wave shape spaceime visible 's light 's pure gravity 's light saw something could see bobbing wave path changed um around moving object sun decides know something crazy would know eight minute later wave got u think right 's cottage industry rising astrophysics 're looking pulsar galaxy Pulsars fast rotating star extremely precise timing precise 's gravitational wave coming towards u passing across field view see effect turbulent space-time wave timing pulsar go wave see move across universe 'll bobble around 're like buoy ocean",
        "Yes 'll 'll see effect happens 's like whoa wrote many paper thought n't exist really struggled whether go right n't know black hole exist maybe well gravitational wave really confounding whether carried energy real substantive way\n\noh 'm changing coordinate 's 's physically real 's physical impact confounding decade would write wrote paper said exist would accepted publication space publication sending press would change entire paper say exist space accepted yes accepted going print would change entire conclusion rewrite paper say exist want writing another paper\n\nRight\n\nRight\n\nRight\n\nRight decide maybe detect Kip Thorne guest show took Star Talk 's Kip Thorne Right moved mountain Kip Thorne went home office Pasadena 's professor emeritus think Caltech talked Interstellar executive producer Interstellar wrote original treatment 's like dream idea write original treatment brought Christopher Nolan realize view",
