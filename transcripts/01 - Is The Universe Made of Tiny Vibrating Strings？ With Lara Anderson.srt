1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Could such extra dimensions exist, and if so, how would we try and probe whether that's the case?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you imagine looking at an extended object like a wire, it just looks one-dimensional, it just looks like it has a length.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But if you were able to get really close to that wire, you'd see that it also has something like a thickness.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And so that extra direction is what's called compact.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is it possible to have a compactified time dimension as well?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh wow! Yeah, imagine two dimensions of time. Wow!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The problem with two-time dimensional theories and compact time dimensions in general is that it's very hard to measure.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And that it's very hard to maintain causality.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Higher dimensions look down on us.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's go!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is Star Talk.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You'll digress Tyson, you're a personal astrophysicist.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Got Chuck Nice with me. How you doing Chuck?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, I'm doing great, man.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right. A comedian, actor?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah. You've seen your food TV commercials here and there?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, you know, I'm about to listen. Sometimes I have nothing to do.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, today we've got a really cool topic that's always on everybody's mind.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What everybody who cares about the universe.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You know, even people who don't, but I'll get into that later.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, what we're talking about, I've heard some really weird stuff from people that, you know.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They want to get into it. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All right. We're talking today about string theory.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And now we have our man about town, so he fears Brian Green right up to street.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But I said, you know, all the universe is not Brian Green.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, he would beg to differ.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a accent.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we reached out to the cosmos.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right. And we found Laura Anderson.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Laura, welcome to Star Talk.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah. So you're associate professor of physics at Virginia Tech.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
One of our producers is from Virginia Tech.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So you're right at home here among us.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, we're family now.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, you're family.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did to be among friends.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Also, like Brian Green, you have a double affiliation also with the mathematics department.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I do. I'm an affiliate professor of mathematics, which means I can supervise math grad students as well.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, so you just, you just taken jobs from everybody.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
His professors out on the street because of Laura Anderson.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's possible.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can try to picture that.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How they, they're like, I'll do your math homework for money.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, we can exactly.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We'll math for food.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think unfortunately that is a job.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I mean, it's called tutors, really, really.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Exactly.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And your research includes, I have here, the geometry and particle phenomenology in string theory.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ooh.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we just want to, let's just get to the bottom of this.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is string theory?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
String theory is an attempt to reconcile Einstein's theory of general relativity, a theory of gravity, with the formalism of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it is a consistent quantum theory of gravity.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It may not be the way that quantum gravity works in our universe, but at the very least, it's a theoretical playground where we get to ask questions about quantum gravity.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now, you've made an assumption in there, and I agree with this assumption, but I want to hear you defend it.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You, you are trying to absorb Einstein's general theory of relativity, our modern understanding of gravity, right?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Into a quantum description.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why aren't you trying to take the quantum and absorb it into a general relativity description?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because inherent in what both of you said, there must be an incongruency that would cause you to have to do that exactly.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So once you start with that, Laura, what is the incongruency here that you're trying to resolve?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Two of the greatest intellectual accomplishments of the 20th century, in my opinion, are Einstein's theory of gravity, and the description of fundamental interactions in nature,

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
as described by particle physics.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So things like a description of quarks, fundamental particles, have they interact with each other that gives us a description of things like electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
These sort of basic building blocks of matter, these fundamental Legos that we can hook together, they're described very well by quantum field theory.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The issue, the sort of discrepancy between these two, is that each separately are able to make predictions that are incredibly accurate in our modern world.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we can make predictions to like 13 significant figures using either of these theoretical frameworks.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would be 13 decimal places, right?

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
13 significant figures, yeah. I'm going to say that's pretty accurate.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's pretty great. Yeah, and like things like modern GPS wouldn't work without general relativity.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But we have a lot of ways of testing these theories. They seem really robust and that they're telling us really important things about how the world behaves.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Unfortunately, if you try and combine the two, so you try and describe phenomena that might need both tools.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So for example, things where the interaction of particles and very short distance scales are in play, but also where there's really strong gravitation.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So for example, inside a black hole, that would be a regime where you need both of these, these theories, these frameworks to agree and give you concrete predictions.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And unfortunately, the theories break down when you try and combine them and you don't end up getting useful answers.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You get very manifestly wrong answers. They're called disastrous infinities.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Things that just don't predict anything.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Disaster is disastrous infinities. You can't get more distant than that. It sounds like the worst marriage ever.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, it's not great. Disaster is infinities.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So what gives you the confidence that it is the quantum physics understanding that will absorb gravity and not gravity absorbing quantum physics?

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a great question. I think that it should be a two way street.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So in order to describe either phenomena, you need something that can be described in both frameworks.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Einstein's theory is sort of intrinsically classical, meaning that this picture of the curvature of space and time, it's not designed for sort of the quantum mechanical uncertainties that we know of and observe in particle physics.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So in that sense, we know that Einstein's theory, probably at a granular level, if you sort of zoom in, should evolve into something quantum mechanical.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Exactly. Form of that is up for exploration.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
OK. So that works. Now you mentioned fundamental particles and you go back to ancient Greece. The atom was a fundamental particle.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That was the smallest thing that you could be that you could be right. And then we break the atom. There's other particles.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And so you you you list it like electron. That's fundamental and you mentioned mentioned quarks.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What gives you the confidence that we can't keep dividing matter further.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah. That's a great question. I don't think I think most theoretical physicists would not say that we are a hundred percent confident that we stop there.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is the zoo of particles that we've observed so far that seem to match the phenomena, the forces and interactions and effects that we see in nature very well.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But absolutely, there could be smaller things in play and indeed string theory posits that there are.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Really? Right. Exactly. That's the that's the little vibrating string is the fun.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The string is the fun. So take us there. OK. Take us out. Now how do strings come into this?

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So the idea behind string theory, the you know, the two minute version of what string theory tries to do is it says imagine that instead of describing particles as little point particles that move through space.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Imagine that instead if you were able to zoom in far enough that you could have an object that has an extended length associated to it.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And the very rough idea is that just like a violin string can vibrate in different ways and produce different notes.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
These little fundamental strings can vibrate into different configurations and it turns out they can change their properties.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The mathematics of how you describe these things moving can change their properties based on how they vibrate.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So they can vibrate one way and be an electron can vibrate another way and be a quirk.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And that seems like a very sort of cute idea for how to describe a lot of physics in a very simple framework.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But if that's the case, in principle, you ought to be able to to pluck the string that is otherwise an electron and get a quirk out of it. Have you done this?

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
No. And the problem with this is one thing that's really cool about this framework and then also two things that are not cool.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
One of them is very much to do with what you said. So why can't you just test or observe, you know, are these strings there?

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The theory predicts that these fundamental length scales of strings are so small that we would need a particle accelerator about the size of the solar system in order to smash atoms together and directly see those strings.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Which unfortunately we do not have access to those type of energy scales yet.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just to affirm what is implicit in your statement, the larger the particle accelerator, the faster you can speed the particles so that when they collide, there's much more energy in that collision.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You'll probe regimes that previous accelerators could not.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay. And so you just scale up what we got going now and you need something the size of the solar system to get to these energies.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right. Which doesn't seem very viable.

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, it's not. So what's your plan B?

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Before I answer that, let me just throw one thing out there about string theory that I think it's important to say.

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So if you ask about quantum mechanical point particles and you say what kind of spaces could they move through?

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It turns out that quantum field theory or quantum mechanics can be formulated in any type of space.

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So they can move through basically any background that you choose any any configuration of space and time.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But if you ask the same question for these little one dimensional strings, if you say where can a quantum mechanical string move?

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It turns out that the only spaces that they're allowed to move in and do their thing of vibrating in different ways and being different particles.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The only space they can do that in are spaces that obey Einstein's equations of general relativity.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's so good.

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, yeah.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So you actually get gravity for free in this formulation of quantum mechanical strings.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So we sometimes say that quantum gravity is consistent and also compulsory in string theory because it's being you know you're forced on you by the equations that the strings and the status.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So that's a good feeling then because it means something is talking to something else in the form in the formulation.

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Right.

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That that was not crowbarred in to begin with.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right. So it's sort of being handed to you and that fact is I think something that early in the development of string theory got a lot of people excited.

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Unfortunately, like many good things things come with a catch and the catch in string theory is that this beautiful formulation I just described of you know you can describe all the particle physics by one little extended object you get gravity for free.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Only seems to work if the universe that this happens in has more than three spatial dimensions and one time like dimension that we seem to see in our universe.

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You need extra dimensions because right now we live in four dimensions, which is three spatial plus time.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You need more dimensions in order to make this thing work, but we don't have access to more dimensions.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So we can't really say for sure.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, it's I mean, it seems like a really big intellectual leap, right?

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We're pretty happy with our three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So the first pass is like could this at all is this just a deal breaker, right? Is there any way that this could be consistent with what we've already observed about the universe?

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And as you were just alluding to right the question is, you know, could such extra dimensions exist? And if so, how would we try and probe whether that's the case?

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The requirement that we can see right off the bat about these extra dimensions is if they were to exist, they can't be the same size as the rest of the dimensions that we see in our universe.

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if we look around, we can see that we have very large spatial extent for front, back side, the side up and down, and of course time.

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But if there were these other directions, they would have to be really, really small compared to the rest of our universe.

146
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And the analog for that is if you imagine looking at an extended object like a wire from really far away, it just looks one dimensional.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It just looks like it has a length. But if you were able to get really close to that wire, you'd see that it also has something like a thickness, a radial direction.

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And so that extra direction is what's called compact, meaning that it's very small compared to say the length of the wire.

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So one thing that we do know is that if this had any chance of working, these extra dimensions would have to be compact and very small compared to the rest of our universe.

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, you're freaking me out right now because and this I'm just going to say it.

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I was down in Costa Rica doing ayahuasca for a week. And in that time, I had an experience where I met these beings who told me about dimensions that existed in the universe.

152
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I think that there was a pre-supposed pre-planted post hypnotic suggestion because I have actually read about spring theory because if it's not.

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So you are what drugs have you been taking to get your my follow up question is what did you do?

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I hear the question. Yeah. Is it possible to have a compactified time dimension as well? Or is we only is all the models only stuck with one time dimension?

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, wow. I've never even considered that. Yeah, imagine two dimensions of time.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Holy crap. Go ahead. Yes. So the problem with two time dimensional theories and compact time dimensions in general is that it's very hard to maintain causality in such theories.

157
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So if you have a time direction that can loop back on itself, it's possible to have the whole go back in time and shoot your grandpa situation hitting you pretty hard.

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So to maintain consistent theories with multiple time directions or compact time directions, it's not I'm not going to say it's impossible, but most people don't consider that a very viable way forward.

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You would have to discard causality altogether in order to do that. I think in general the claim would have be it would violate causality in such theories.

160
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So there may be some creative ways to get around that, but generically I think that's true.

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
By the way, we have a Stephen Hawking on one of our earlier episodes. You can find it in our archives.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We went to University Cambridge and chilled with him for a bit. Tell me he proposed a time travel conjecture, something like that.

163
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Tell us what that was. And did that save us from this? Is that I mean there are a number of conjectures say in the theory of gravity that say that causality is an important structure.

164
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So that in general one would not expect that consistent theories of gravity or indeed quantum mechanics should allow.

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You just can't get it to work. Okay. Yeah. That that's why I mean, I mean, let's miss that that removes many movies in the repertoire where you got to go back and change the path.

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Exactly. All the terminator has done it. Forget about it. We look back on the past, but we look forward to many futures.

167
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So the idea of being able to look back and say at this particular point, all those many futures still exist.

168
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If I could get back to that point, then I could change it to one of these other tracks. You know, which I mean, it's a great fantasy.

169
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And it makes sense to have that fantasy. But what you're saying is it's a stupid fantasy because it ain't never going to happen.

170
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, I would say, you know, never say never in insights. You got to be careful. But certainly it's not something that most people have a good idea how to make work in a consistent way.

171
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And that's why I'm not a scientist. Just consider to say never say never. You just never said never.

172
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can't say never say never. What I'm saying never.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, start talk fans. I don't know if you know this, but the audio version of the podcast actually posts a week in advance of the video version.

174
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And you can get that and Spotify and Apple podcast and most other podcast outlets that are out there.

175
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Multiple ways to ingest all that is cosmic on start talk.

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Before we sort of pivot to the whole thing of phenomenology because I want to know it's a big word with a lot of syllables.

177
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I've heard it invoked before, especially in particle physics. But before we step there, I just want to understand how will you ever test string theory.

178
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And we know in advance that you have naysayers out there, physicists among them who are saying you're diverting time resources, graduate students, faculty positions to something that doesn't even classify as a legit.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's not that you're going to be able to identify as a legitimate scientific theory or hypothesis because you need to be able to test it without the test.

180
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Go home. So let me hear your response to that.

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Absolutely. I think that's a really fair question.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For any theoretical framework where you're trying to describe things.

183
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If there's a big intellectual leap, right? And for example, extra dimensions is a pretty big leap.

184
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You have to justify that with a payoff. Right. You have to say what is the benefit that I'm going to give you in terms of structure and predictions and

185
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
what you're learning from this theory. So to push back on the how are we going to test it.

186
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let me observe first that in particle theory in general, the time scales between predicting structure in particle theory and then being able to see it in experiment over the last half century have gone increased in size considerably.

187
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So one example of this is the prediction of the Higgs boson made by Peter Higgs, which took about 50 years from the prediction that this particle should exist to its observation at the LHC.

188
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That means the theorist are just way ahead of the experimentalist. Right. I guess some deadbeat experimentalist.

189
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I would not say that at all. I would say that that dialogue of theory and experiment is really important.

190
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But I'm just pointing out that direct experiment of direct verification by experiment of lots of things is hard.

191
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That doesn't mean that one shouldn't do it. It just means that you have to be deciding what time scales are relevant for that question.

192
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,000
For string theory, I would say the problem is a lot worse than it was for something like the prediction of the Higgs boson because the energy scales are so massive to directly observe strings.

193
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So for me personally, I'm interested in trying to decide whether string theory is useful a lot faster than that in the point of view of my career.

194
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I remain very agnostic as to whether that's the case.

195
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If you want to be alive, do it when you decide this.

196
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If somebody could demonstrate to me right now that string theory was for sure not useful for our universe, I choose to work on something else.

197
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So what do I think is the most direct way to those types of answers is that in string theory, many types of structure and results in physics are really intercorrelated.

198
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So it turns out that in something like the particle physics description of all the particles we know about so far, the standard model of particle physics.

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So that's the organization of all the particles that we know.

200
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Just one chart.

201
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And you say this interacts with that and this connects here.

202
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it's a beautiful thing actually when you step back and it's a tri... I mean that happened in... I'm older than both of you all.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That happened in my lifetime.

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean then basically in the 1970s, we started assembling a little earlier too, but the full picture was coming together as we found these other particles to flesh it out.

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's a periodic table of particles.

206
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay.

207
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
All right.

208
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Organizations.

209
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Organizations.

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Very good.

211
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay. So pick it up there. Sorry.

212
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Quick anecdote from when I was a kid.

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I got interested in physics reading books like by people like Brian Green when I was, you know, in my early teens.

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And I had a little... I'd written down the standard model like on a piece of paper.

215
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I made my little zoo of particles and I carried around on a piece of paper for a bit as a super, you know, nerdy young person.

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The girl geek in the house?

217
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Love it.

218
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Girl geek alert.

219
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Totally, totally. But I totally agree.

220
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's the zoo of what we know is there.

221
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And the point I was going to make in relation to string theory is that in something like the standard model, there's a lot of free numbers.

222
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So for example, nothing in that theory tells you what the mass of the electron is or how the quarks couple to each other.

223
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Those numbers are just observed in our universe.

224
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well you said free numbers, you mean not predicted.

225
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Correct. Not predicted by the structure of the theory.

226
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now in contrast to that, in string theory, if you found a solution in string theory that produced particle physics like we see in our universe, none of those numbers are free.

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They're all determined by the configuration of these extra dimensions and the structure of the theory.

228
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So it's a huge array of physics that you have to get right all at once.

229
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And here I've been talking about particle physics, but you also have to answer questions about cosmology and the large scale structure and history of the universe.

230
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So how are you going to decide if string theory is wrong?

231
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I think that it's most likely that we would be able to say that the structures that we see in nature, we can argue that we either can or can't get the right sort of regimes of numbers and effects that we already know are there.

232
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Much more rapidly than we're going to build an accelerator to see a string.

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I love that.

234
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So what you're saying is whether or not you can test the dimensionality or the other sort of physicality of string theory.

235
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If you're a theorist can go in the back room and come out and say, I plucked this string this way, it's going to give me an electron and it's going to give me this mass.

236
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right. And it's the only mass that's going to come out of this.

237
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Right. Because that's the right number.

238
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's the right number and the right vibration and it's going to look like an electron.

239
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's a Nobel Prize right there.

240
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah. It's like the way they do modeling or weather modeling.

241
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We have a prediction and then we run the model on what's already been done.

242
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And if we get those numbers, then we can have confidence in the predictive model itself.

243
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right.

244
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Again, so the idea is I just articulated it.

245
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This has been around for like 40 years.

246
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This was what when people were first formulating string theory, everybody was excited and they thought we were going to do exactly what you just said.

247
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know, you're going to go around, you're going to look at the solutions of the string theory.

248
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're going to say, boom, here's our universe. Here's all these numbers. We just predict everything.

249
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's great. That hasn't happened.

250
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And there's, you know, people are still trying to think about this.

251
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So what are some of the big obstacles?

252
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
One of the issues is that it turns out that when you ask how many different configurations for these extra dimensions can there be?

253
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Initially, the hope was that maybe that was very restrictive.

254
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Maybe there was just a couple.

255
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The question of how many could you have?

256
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So if you said, what if we just had, say, two extra dimensions that obeyed the consistency equations from string theory?

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Turns out there's a unique answer from the differential equations that tell you what that shape could be.

258
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If you ask, is there, you know, what happens if there are four extra dimensions?

259
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's a unique answer.

260
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then if you say, what happens if there were six extra dimensions, which happens to be the extra dimensions that we think needs to arise to give what we see in nature?

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Turns out there are half a billion configurations and counting that have been found so far.

262
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So it sounds to me like what you guys are saying is we have this instrument.

263
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And on the instrument, there's a certain amount of notes that are just resident in the instrument.

264
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And now we have to figure out one song.

265
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because all those notes can make however many billions of songs.

266
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We've got to find the one song that all those notes can play.

267
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But it also sounds like nature's just messing with us.

268
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It sounds so this is one of the things that people push back on string theory.

269
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I say, okay, if all these possible solutions of string theory exist, how is it ever going to be predicted?

270
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And you know, you could just have this big soup of things.

271
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And some people have even made that argument. They call it the string landscape where they say, you know, you could just land anywhere.

272
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So what if there's some place in the string landscape that looks like our universe, there's all this other junk.

273
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What is the theory actually telling us them?

274
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And the argument I would say against that is that in something like quantum field theory, which we already talked about for the standard model, this is who of all the, you know, quirks and leptons that we know in nature.

275
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There are an infinite number of quantum field theories that I could write down that aren't our universe.

276
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But it doesn't matter because we do know how to write down one that does look like our universe.

277
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So string theory is sort of a natural extension of quantum field theory in some ways.

278
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And it has a lot of flexibility that may have nothing to do with the physics that we observe in our universe.

279
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But the question is once you zoom in on the parts of that theory that do, do you learn anything?

280
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So for example, do you find that if you see the particles that we already know that additional particles must be there or additional forces?

281
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Or can we correlate features and cosmology in the large scale structure of the universe like dark energy or dark matter with particle physics that we know to be true?

282
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't want to lessen the significance of how you describe that.

283
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But if I understand it, you're saying on this, like you said, this landscape of half a billion possible songs that it could be and you want the one song that's yours, it's not useful if you find it unless upon finding it, you get other insights about the universe we're in.

284
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Because otherwise it's just a just so story, right?

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The universe is just that and we explain it with just that and it doesn't take you any further down the street.

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Is that a fair way to characterize it?

287
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

288
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And another thing that people are asking within string theory is how many possible quantum theories of gravity could there be?

289
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So imagine that string theory isn't how our universe works.

290
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We know it's a quantum theory of gravity, but it might be too idealized to describe our universe.

291
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So in physics, we talk about pretending that cows are spheres in order to make the math easier.

292
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Consider a spherical cow.

293
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, God.

294
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We do that all the time.

295
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay.

296
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, just easier.

297
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That our our society of physics students has a spherical towel t-shirt here for a Virginia Tech.

298
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a thing.

299
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's that's pretty wild.

300
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's a thing.

301
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
If you want to maximize the milk production of a cow, right?

302
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Start with a spherical cow.

303
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Start with a spherical cow.

304
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah. Right on.

305
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah.

306
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't want that milk.

307
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't want milk from a spherical cow.

308
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah.

310
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

311
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm going goat's milk from now on.

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah.

313
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But yeah, the point I make is that maybe string theory isn't, you know, it's just too idealized to describe how quantum gravity works in our universe.

314
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But a lot of theorists are questioning, okay, if that's the case, we know this is a quantum theory of gravity.

315
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So if you had another one, right, like the right one that isn't a string theory, how could those two theories be related?

316
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And there's groups of string theorists who are trying to argue and provide mathematical theorems.

317
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
For example, someone in Kermanbatha at Harvard has created something called the Kubordism Conjecture.

318
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And what he's positing is that perhaps if you had more than one quantum theory of gravity, they must be connected in some way.

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Otherwise, you would develop inconsistencies in how you could describe quantum gravity or quantum gravitational effects.

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So the argument I'm making here is that even if string theory isn't the right one, whatever that might mean, maybe it's connected to the right one.

321
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So maybe we still learn structure about how string theory can inform what our universe should look like.

322
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Is this what, not exactly what you just said, but the comprehensive look at all of this?

323
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Is this what gives rise to the multiverse and infinite number of universes?

324
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's a different question, but an interesting one.

325
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That the answer is no.

326
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The answer is no.

327
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

328
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We'll say that for you.

329
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We'll say that for later.

330
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You're a specific specialty within string theory is particle phenomenology.

331
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Could you just introduce us to that?

332
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Absolutely.

333
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So that's the question of whether string theory can produce solutions that look like the particle physics that we see, the standard model, for example, and the interactions of the other fundamental forces that aren't gravity.

334
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And so one of the things that I've worked on at various times over my career is trying to ask for the types of solutions that we see in string theory.

335
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What characterizes those that would give us things like we see in nature?

336
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So again, coming back to this concept of the string landscape, there's a famous number of like possible solutions that you can get for this string landscape, a number of like 10 to the 500, which is unimaginably large as thrown around.

337
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So we can't do the 500.

338
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
10 to the 500.

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That's not a number.

340
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That's not a number.

341
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's not a number.

342
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's not a number.

343
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But in that counting of solutions in string theory, so this is again, you know, something people say, oh, you know, 10 to the 500, how are you going to learn anything?

344
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But all of those 10 to the 500 that people have counted historically, none of them included an electron.

345
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay.

346
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So if you know something about the universe, you want a model, you don't care if you're straight.

347
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Straight to the 500.

348
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

349
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
None of those can possibly give rise to the type of physics we see.

350
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So the type of research that I do is trying to correlate what shapes for these extra dimensions, what properties of string theory will narrow the field down to things that are close to our universe.

351
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay. So have you gotten here yet?

352
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What's what's, you know, what's the hold up here?

353
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We're getting better.

354
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I mean, in all honesty, you know, we have not delivered on that yet, but we are, I feel like still making legitimate progress.

355
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay.

356
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So how about this because one of the great redeeming qualities of all scientific discovery or the search thereof is even if I don't get to the thing I am trying to find out along the way, I find out all this other great stuff that now gives us computers and digital cameras and GPS, but I didn't get to what I wanted.

357
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So what have you guys contributed that has been your happy accident?

358
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, I mean, I'm going to say that more tightly.

359
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Say it tighter.

360
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You ready?

361
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
No, I love that.

362
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Go ahead.

363
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I loved it, but I want to say it another way.

364
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
All right.

365
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay.

366
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
In your failures, how have you succeeded?

367
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So I think the answer to that is really big.

368
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And string theory as a field has really expanded to, you know, huge different numbers of subfields and researchers who do really different things.

369
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So there are many different answers to that question.

370
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I could, like, you know, percolating the back of my mind.

371
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:21,000
One is the discovery of the holographic principle, which says that phenomena like gravity are very deeply related to things called gauge theories, which again describe the interactions of particles and charges.

372
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That these things can be related in different dimensions of spaces.

373
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So the statement is that gravitational theories can be related to gauge theories that live on the quote boundary of that space.

374
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Things like the holographic principle are an extremely deep bit of structure that says that, you know, gauge theories and particle physics and gravity are not as different as we thought they were.

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's, that's a really profound, I would say observation that has arisen in string theory.

376
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So the simplest example that I've heard of the holographic principle is the surface of the event horizon of a black hole.

377
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay. And correct me from wrong here.

378
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So you fall through the surface has a memory of everything that passed through.

379
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Interesting.

380
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And so you can think of the information content of the surface as the full understanding of anything that's inside.

381
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because there's no loss of information because it's all retained on the surface.

382
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And so that inside the black hole, and if we are inside a black hole of our universe, because we have a horizon, which you can, and, and now I'm trying to invent horizon.

383
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Right. Then we would be the holographic projections of that.

384
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So is this a fair, did I, did I capture that?

385
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, it does.

386
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Wow. Okay.

387
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And even that, I've yet to heard a physicist rebut that.

388
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So is the general agreement that that's probably real?

389
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean, in an idealized sense, yes.

390
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
How much that, you know, pertains, you know, what you learn from that in our universe, I think, is still up for grabs.

391
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And this is again, something people are, are thinking about very actively.

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Other analogies that I would give for, you know, useful stuff that's come out of string theory is relationships again between things like particle physics and cosmology.

393
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So, you know, the study of, you know, dark energy, dark matter, descriptions of inflation, those things being related to, you know, how particle physics realizes those.

394
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And also structure in mathematics.

395
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So there are a lot of new fields of mathematics that were sparked due to that dialogue between mathematicians and physicists that arose through string theory and these shapes of extra dimensions.

396
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So that's good.

397
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So you're exciting mathematicians, right?

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah.

399
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And then they reached out and wanted some of you in their department, right?

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Sometimes, yeah.

401
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I think, you know, it's a very much a mutual relationship.

402
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Which is why you're taking a job away from another professor.

403
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So as what example of this, there's something called the minimal model program in geometry, which tries to classify basically all these higher dimensional complex shapes like all of them.

404
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, can you write down compact geometries in any number of dimensions and characterize all their properties and come up with sort of a zoo of every possible geometry?

405
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well, we get this is your other specialty algebraic geometry.

406
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's right.

407
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Was that a spin off of the rest of these interests?

408
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Is that?

409
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No, it's very much tied to it.

410
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So the question of trying to produce particle physics from string theory, that's a particle physics question.

411
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But the actual computation you have to do really rests on the properties of these compact extra dimensions.

412
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So you have to do a ton of geometry to extract the numbers that you want, like the mass of the electron and the coupling of the quarks.

413
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So it's sort of intrinsically interdisciplinary in that sense.

414
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Wow.

415
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So I want to hear more about this geometry.

416
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's, I mean, that's crazy.

417
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So here's something that is so simple and low dimensional.

418
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So don't laugh at me.

419
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But I was, but I want you to take this to your level.

420
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I was talking within a topologist, algebraic, or some one of these math folk.

421
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And we were talking about knots.

422
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay.

423
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Just knots.

424
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
All right.

425
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And you take a string and tie a knot in it.

426
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And it's a knot.

427
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's a square knot.

428
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Or any whatever you're not is.

429
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Whatever you're not is.

430
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Whatever you're not.

431
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Okay.

432
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Whatever you're not.

433
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And then we, that's where in three dimensions here.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So a one dimensional string can make a knot.

435
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I said, what's that in fourth spatial dimension?

436
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He said, you can't tie a knot in four dimensions.

437
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You would just lift it up and it would just unravel.

438
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And I, so that just messed with me.

439
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And then I, then I thought, let's take away a dimension.

440
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's go to two dimensions.

441
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay.

442
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Two dimensions.

443
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,559
And if you have two dimensional people in a flat surface, if you take a rope and just

444
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,519
loop it on itself, they cannot undo that.

445
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,880
That is an unsolvable knot to them because they can't pass it back over itself to come

446
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
around.

447
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Right.

448
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
All right.

449
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,079
But I, in three dimensions, pick it up and it's gone.

450
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,079
Right.

451
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,440
So that was, so I was just, I couldn't sleep that night.

452
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,440
And then I wondered myself, what is going on in the mind of someone who's imagining all

453
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,000
of this in even higher dimensions than that?

454
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,440
What kind of drugs are you hiding?

455
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
You're just, come on, Lard, don't hold out on me.

456
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,800
I shared my ayahuasca, give us the real dope.

457
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,800
You never told us that ayahuasca, the high dimensionality person, talk to you.

458
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Well, you know what?

459
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,440
I have, you guys are the first to know because it was so freaky and freaky out and I never

460
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
talked about it.

461
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
But then we see, there's a string theorist on the future.

462
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Exactly.

463
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
You said you are our savior.

464
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,440
I was the neo of string theory.

465
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
The neo.

466
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Yeah.

467
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,599
What is the matrix, neo?

468
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,599
So please tell us.

469
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,280
So I really like the, the knot analogy.

470
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,039
Let me give another one that's sort of worn directly related to the kind of stuff I do.

471
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,159
So we talked about, you know, Einstein's theory of gravity.

472
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,480
You could ask, imagine that the entire universe was too dimensional, right?

473
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
And you have curvature that could lead to like gravitational like theories in two dimensions.

474
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,719
And it turns out there's only one number that you get to specify.

475
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,079
And it's basically, you know, if you imagine like the surface of a sphere, it's whether

476
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,840
it's, you know, positively curved or negatively curved like a saddle.

477
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
That's it.

478
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,599
And so you can't have dynamical gravity in two dimensions.

479
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,519
Likewise, you know, the form gravitation takes will change as you go up in dimension.

480
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,559
So absolutely the, this question of, you know, what can you not and unnot?

481
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,679
What can you use to describe how space and high mic curve, all of that changes with different

482
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,679
dimensions?

483
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,679
Yeah.

484
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,679
And so you have to get your brain up.

485
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm up in there.

486
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,679
I'm telling you right now.

487
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,679
I'm, you know, I need a nap.

488
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,039
Just from this conversation.

489
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:35,440
So, so, but the, the cop out thing here is all the higher dimensions are all compacted.

490
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,840
So I don't have to think about or worry about it.

491
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll never see them.

492
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Right?

493
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:46,079
So, I don't, impactful are the compacted dimensions if you, if you're trying to manifest gravity in higher

494
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,079
dimensions.

495
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,480
Does gravity care if it's compacted or not?

496
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,120
Does it just care about the dimensionality?

497
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
It does.

498
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
It does care if it's compact.

499
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,640
It cares about the compactness.

500
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,120
It cares about the shape of those extra dimensions.

501
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,160
And indeed, we believe in string theory that those extra dimensions have to still obey

502
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Einstein's equations.

503
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,920
So they still have to, to be consistent gravity in, in those extra dimensions.

504
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,240
Suppose we lived in eight dimensions and he came up with general relativity in eight

505
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
dimensions.

506
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Right.

507
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,840
Who would you say his three plus one dimensional thing that higher dimensions have to obey

508
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,000
that?

509
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,800
He did that in this measly three plus one dimensional world.

510
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,440
You can't put, you can't put commandments on higher dimensions.

511
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,360
They are superior to us in every way and you know it.

512
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Yes.

513
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,440
I, I, I hate to say it, but higher dimensions look down on us.

514
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's go.

515
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
I had a teacher.

517
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Right.

518
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
That is a good teacher.

519
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,119
So I actually torture my undergraduate students in my class on Einstein's theory because

520
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,119
Einstein's theory can be actually formulated in any number of dimensions very easily.

521
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,320
So there's actually nothing special about four.

522
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,880
So frequently for my students, I'll say, you know, imagine that this was in six dimensions

523
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,320
or ten dimensions or you know, she said it can be formulated easily, but she didn't say

524
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,960
what she meant by easily.

525
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Very relative statement there.

526
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Yeah.

527
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,159
But one thing that isn't easy and this is actually related to why it's hard again to really

528
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,920
bring string theory to its full fruition is that when you do do Einstein's theory and

529
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,280
higher dimensions, the equations you have to solve are nastier.

530
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,480
So humans are not really good at nonlinear differential equations and they are especially

531
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,599
not good when they go into high numbers of variables and high numbers of dimensions.

532
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,079
So isn't that some?

533
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Okay.

534
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,119
So why don't you just get a math fluid AI bot to do this?

535
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,400
I mean, that's the whole point of, I mean, yeah, exactly.

536
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,519
It's hard for you, but give it to an AI.

537
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,519
Yeah.

538
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,759
So one of the things that we've had to try and do in string theory to extract some of

539
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:51,360
these predictions is actually solve Einstein's equations for these extra compact dimensions.

540
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,880
And we don't know any analytic solutions for how that means, you know, exact solutions

541
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,840
you could write down on a piece of paper for Einstein's theory for the six dimensions

542
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,119
that we would need for these string compactifications.

543
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,119
They're called.

544
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,079
In science, you can solve a problem analytically with an equation and say there's the answer.

545
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:17,200
And some you can't and you have to actually run the experiment or increment a model and

546
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,800
see the results each time just to see where it goes.

547
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Right.

548
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
And so that's ugly.

549
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,640
We hate those, but we kind of recognize that that's like in chaos theory.

550
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,480
You have to sort of calculate it out.

551
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Right.

552
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,920
You can't just write down the solution.

553
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,799
So if you're saying you can't in principle, or it's just too laborious, just not known

554
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:37,679
how to do it yet.

555
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,799
So in general, solving Einstein's equations and any number of dimensions, you know, for

556
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:44,559
any system is hard because they're nonlinear.

557
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:49,920
So what that means is that the gravitational theory is actually back reacting or talking

558
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
to itself.

559
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,079
So the fact that you have gravitons, you know, the quantum mechanical description of gravity

560
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,159
in the space, that can create more gravity.

561
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,719
So this is really wild in terms of the differential equations because normally you could say I find

562
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,679
one solution to the theory and I find another and I can just add them together and still

563
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,000
get a solution.

564
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,719
But in general relativity, that doesn't work.

565
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,799
You can't add two solutions and get another solution.

566
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:15,799
You have to start over every time.

567
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:20,159
So so when we, when we model, we do this in astrophysics all the time.

568
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,319
The stuff that's just too complicated, but I know at any instant what's supposed to

569
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,440
happen and then I just load that up.

570
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,159
But what you're doing is you're calculating with these differential equations.

571
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,519
These equations that you can calculate it every time step and it's following you on

572
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,519
the time step.

573
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,519
Right.

574
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,519
Right.

575
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,519
All right.

576
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,519
But you can't just solve out the whole, the whole Chabang.

577
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,759
So that's so all right.

578
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:46,719
So you're, but so tell me again why you can't use AI you.

579
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,639
So we can actually and that's, that's a fun topic.

580
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:53,759
So I was involved for a number of years with numeric simulations like you're describing

581
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,839
where you use a computer to try and solve the equations that you, you can't otherwise.

582
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,920
And historically in order to do those computations, we had to put them on super computer clusters

583
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
and like wait for months to get results.

584
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,159
But now actually with the advent of AI, this is something that my collaborator is that

585
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,159
I have worked on.

586
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,759
And now you just do it on your iPhone.

587
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:14,759
Now we can actually do it on a laptop.

588
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:18,480
And so we've started using machine learning algorithms to numerically solve some of these

589
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,800
differential equations.

590
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,360
So this is different than using like, you know, looking at photos on the internet and then

591
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,280
having AI generate a new photo.

592
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,639
We don't have these solutions.

593
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,440
So there is in a database that you can train an AI model on, but you can still use the

594
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,159
framework of these neural networks to try and solve really complicated equations.

595
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,000
And indeed, I worked on that and then lots of other people in the field have.

596
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,480
And we found that using these techniques, we can speed up a lot of computations in a

597
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,119
really substantive way.

598
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,960
And this actually made it possible just recently for groups to compute quark masses in string

599
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,239
theory for the first time.

600
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,279
So to be clear, these are not the quark mass values that we actually observe in nature.

601
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:58,079
That would be awesome, but we don't see that yet.

602
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,400
But we can say if you just hand me some extra dimensions, whatever they may be, and then

603
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,719
say what would the, you know, the quarks look like in that universe, now we can actually

604
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,599
come up with those numbers using machine learning algorithms.

605
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,920
Chuck will go back on his Iowaska trip and get the person from that dimension to verify

606
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
the quarks mass.

607
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Yeah.

608
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Exactly.

609
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,039
And Chuck will be the Oracle of physics.

610
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,039
And I'm up for it.

611
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,039
I'm coming right now.

612
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,039
I'm ready to handle it.

613
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,559
I'm ready to know the more I lost it.

614
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,039
So I'm ready.

615
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,800
So let me ask another thing.

616
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,440
You talk about what discoveries can come out of this.

617
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,119
Is it possible?

618
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,000
Because this excites us all.

619
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,519
We don't say it every day, but we feel it.

620
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:47,079
Could any of this, could any of this bring forth new physics?

621
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,400
Because up till now everything you've said has been within the framework of the quantum

622
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,159
quantum field theory, general relativity.

623
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,639
And imagine before Einstein was born, you would not even know that relativity was a thing

624
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:02,280
you could use to solve your problems.

625
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,039
So is there some new physics waiting to emerge either out of your work or some yet to be

626
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,619
born genius that you'll look at it and say, oh my gosh, I'm going to give a fast astro

627
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,619
case here.

628
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:15,619
Okay.

629
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:21,279
At turn of the century, the orbit of Mercury around the sun wasn't quite following Newton's

630
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,279
laws.

631
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:25,920
You know, it was like, well, there's probably another planet there tugging on it.

632
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,519
Yeah, we've named the planet.

633
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,519
I mean, that's how, oh really?

634
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,519
Yeah, we called it Vulcan.

635
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,519
I'll know.

636
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,519
Yeah, yeah, go 1910.

637
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:32,519
Just look up planet Vulcan.

638
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,519
Like, there it is.

639
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:34,519
It's pretty low.

640
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:35,519
Okay.

641
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:36,519
And so, and we were happy.

642
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,519
Well, how come no one saw it?

643
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,519
It's too close to the sun.

644
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,519
Right.

645
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:40,519
It's in the glare.

646
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,759
So we had, we had that was all there.

647
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:42,759
It was all worked out.

648
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:43,759
All worked out.

649
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:47,079
And then Einstein comes up with general relativity.

650
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:52,079
He wasn't trying to explain it, but he showed that it very strong gravity, Newton's laws

651
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,320
fail.

652
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,960
You plug into his equations and there's no disagreement with the thing.

653
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,759
So Vulcan died overnight, but the new physics transformed the physics we were already working

654
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,920
with and gave us better answers to move on with.

655
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,000
So what I learned from that is Einstein killed Vulcan, Tyson killed Pluto.

656
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Stop.

657
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,600
There's not the lesson.

658
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
That's a good lesson.

659
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
No, it's not.

660
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
No.

661
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,840
So new physics could take a lot of different forms.

662
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,120
So one example might be perhaps there are more than the four fundamental forces that

663
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,720
we've already observed in nature.

664
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,599
So could there be, you know, so called fifth force, another version of something like

665
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,480
electromagnetism or, you know, the strong weak nuclear force?

666
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,719
That would be an example of new physics.

667
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,799
Other things that we know we don't understand very well, include things like dark energy

668
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,279
and dark matter.

669
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:51,599
Questions like general relativity tells us that there are these disastrous infinities,

670
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,279
you know, in the center of black holes, there's singularities.

671
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:59,359
So what actually repairs those singularities in a quantum, you know, gravitational theory?

672
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,039
It tells us how physics really behaves inside there.

673
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:04,680
That's definitely new physics.

674
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,880
And that would be the hope of the kind of thing you'd like to see.

675
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Oh, wow.

676
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
So, okay.

677
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,880
So you think there's new physics out there?

678
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Not.

679
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,680
Again, the claims on, you know, what constraint theory deliver?

680
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,680
I'm still somewhat agnostic on that.

681
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,240
But I think it's really interesting to try and push the theory to find out, say, you know,

682
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,120
can you show that this just can't be used to model our universe, which is a real possibility

683
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,519
and it's going to break somewhere you can't get there.

684
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:32,279
Or can you, you push it to try and make some of this structure visible?

685
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,279
So I just, I love 100 years from now, look back on this conversation.

686
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,920
Say, look at those 80s back in 2025.

687
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,359
Yeah, this will be a Kendrickard's video.

688
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,559
A hundred years from now.

689
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,559
I hope so.

690
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:49,400
So I got something else here about a duality in string theory.

691
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
What's going on there?

692
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,119
Yeah, this is something that I and my collaborators are working on at the moment.

693
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,400
That's a cool word by the duality.

694
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I love duality.

695
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,119
So the idea behind duality is that you could have two different theories or two different

696
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,760
geometries as they arise for these compact, extra dimensions in string theory that secretly

697
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,200
are different sides of the same coin.

698
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,000
So an analogy that I give sometimes in talks is if you ever looked at some of these optical

699
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,519
illusions photos on the internet where you know, you have a picture that's either a

700
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,519
vase.

701
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,880
If you look at it one way or two faces, if you look at it the other way, you can say,

702
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,960
you know, is it a vase or is it faces?

703
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
And the answer is it's both, right?

704
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,480
It's both packaged.

705
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,480
The question in string theory is you have all these different half a billion configurations

706
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,000
for extra dimensions.

707
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,079
Do they all lead to different physics?

708
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,119
And the answer that we think is no.

709
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,159
There are known equivalences of different so-called topological spaces.

710
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:41,679
These are things that have a different geometric properties like their number of holes and

711
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,480
their structure.

712
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,920
Those different topological spaces can actually lead to the same physics that we would see.

713
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,800
So that if there's redundancy in that, that's really powerful because it means you don't

714
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
have to search through half a billion possibilities.

715
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,320
You can maybe sort of fold those possibilities in half and only look at some portion of them.

716
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,280
Some of these dualities have been around for 20 years in string theory and my collaborators

717
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,760
and I think we have new examples which require less supersymmetry.

718
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,200
So a less spherical cow than people who assumed it.

719
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,200
OK.

720
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,960
We're growing some legs in the cow, for example.

721
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,600
And we think that this may improve our ability to calculate lots of things and also teach

722
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,679
us some new properties mathematically about how these spaces can behave.

723
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,880
Well, we catch us up on supersymmetry.

724
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,679
So supersymmetry is something that comes along for some formulations of string theory,

725
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:39,799
which says that all the quarks and leptons that we see in nature may have additional partners.

726
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:46,360
So for example, instead of a quark, you have a squark, another partner that would be much

727
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,199
heavier than the existing particles that we've seen.

728
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,919
So when you're describing supersymmetry, it's a symmetry beyond the symmetries that

729
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:57,359
are already known and loved in the standard model.

730
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,359
That's right.

731
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:02,879
So all these sort of three generations of quarks and leptons that we've seen already,

732
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:07,039
there would be another whole set of those particles that would share many of their properties

733
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,639
but be heavier and mass and sort of the opposites in each theory, you know, each particle

734
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,960
that was say a boson would have a fermionic partner and so on.

735
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,960
So what you're saying is you're not content with just these three regimes we have in the standard model.

736
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,360
Just hand us somewhere in the universe other regimes above that and see what properties

737
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,159
they might have and that could explain stuff that we don't now understand.

738
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,159
That's an idea.

739
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,679
And people initially thought this idea might explain some really important questions in particle physics,

740
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,199
for example, to do with the mass of the Higgs boson.

741
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,279
That would be what's called low scale supersymmetry and particle experiments like the LHC

742
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:47,599
search very hard for this and didn't see it.

743
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,319
So some people consider supersymmetry not a very useful idea because they thought,

744
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:55,480
you know, it might appear in these regimes and it would not be useful.

745
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,879
People are re-investigating this question in string theory, you know,

746
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,439
some of the solutions are string theory or supersymmetric, some are not.

747
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,879
What we generally would agree on is that if you did have supersymmetry,

748
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:07,759
it would have to be at a very high scale.

749
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,800
So it would be much, these particles would be much heavier than you could see at an experiment

750
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,840
like the LHC and that the symmetry would be spontaneously broken in universes like ours

751
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,360
so that by the time you got down to, you know, where we live now,

752
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,120
you would only see the standard model particles of the energy.

753
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,120
And not the other ones that would have helped birth it.

754
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:33,400
So, so I'm going to say that's rather convenient though.

755
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,280
I'm just going to say.

756
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,760
So the question is like, why do you need that symmetry, right?

757
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,079
If you're kind of getting rid of it back when, you know,

758
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,840
you really want to be talking about the physics, yeah.

759
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,599
Conveniently. Right. Disgarding.

760
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,760
That's a great, great question.

761
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,800
In some string theories, it still plays a role in terms of regulating the quantum

762
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,440
and canonical behavior of the theory and making it well-behaved.

763
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,720
So in that sense, you know, you're still using it theoretically for something,

764
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:04,679
even though you don't need it to describe the particle physics that we are observing in nature.

765
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:06,519
But I think all string theorists would ask,

766
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:07,959
it's a really interesting question to say,

767
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:11,399
how much of the super symmetry can you get rid of and then still preserve

768
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,559
the features that are of interest to us?

769
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,639
So the types of dualities I was describing, these are perhaps new

770
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,799
because they involved less reliance on super symmetry than we had in the past.

771
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:24,839
And so we're still observing this sort of redundancy

772
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,359
or these different descriptions of the same physics package different ways.

773
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,559
But we don't need as much super symmetry.

774
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,079
If memory serves, the graviton is not in the standard model, is that correct?

775
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:37,480
That's right.

776
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:44,039
So that means no one is thinking about a super symmetric particle to the graviton

777
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:45,640
because that would be kind of interesting.

778
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,039
Yeah, you certainly could, for any particle,

779
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,480
you know, any gauge boson, you could have what's called the gauge eno.

780
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,640
So a super symmetric particle.

781
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,840
Gage eno.

782
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,240
They're just making such a opponent out of the ass.

783
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,439
Yes, it sounds like you're naming like pharmaceutical products.

784
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:03,959
This is before my era in physics, but I do feel that some of these names

785
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,639
are very much a product of the 1970s.

786
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,079
I was in high school, that's how old I am, in the 1970s.

787
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,719
And I'm just, you know, there was like the particle of a month club,

788
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:16,039
what new particle was being discovered in the new accelerators in California and elsewhere.

789
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:20,359
And we were just building this fabric of the universe out of that.

790
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:21,000
That's kind of cool.

791
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,279
That's good to be witness to it.

792
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:22,759
It was fun.

793
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:23,479
That's fun.

794
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:24,519
Yeah, not participant.

795
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:24,919
Right.

796
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,559
Yeah.

797
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,159
Could you expend a moment just celebrating the idea of symmetry in physics?

798
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:34,119
Yeah, this is a really, really great question.

799
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:40,680
So symmetry in physics, this is something that is extremely deep and has been very,

800
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,519
very predictive and powerful over the last 100 years of physics.

801
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,760
So this is a question that in my classes to undergraduates, I try and convey that a lot of

802
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,039
physics is based on looking at a phenomena that you see like an apple falling from a tree

803
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,039
and saying, you know, how do I model the path that that's going to fall?

804
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:58,279
Right.

805
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:00,119
Like, how do I write an equation that describes that?

806
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:06,840
But once you start talking about symmetries and these are basically rules for how you might change

807
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,960
a space or an equation in ways that can leave it alone, once you start talking about symmetries,

808
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,599
you actually have the power to ask, could the theory that I'm describing be any different?

809
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,279
It allows you to ask questions about not just what you observe,

810
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,200
but whether any theory that you write down could have arisen differently in nature.

811
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,200
So there's some kind of high-falutin quote by Einstein that, you know,

812
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:36,120
saying he wanted to probe God's thoughts, you know, in terms of his theories, which sounds extremely grandiose.

813
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:42,280
But the tangible, non-theological underpinning of that is that you can ask for a theory,

814
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,760
if I write down this theory, like Einstein's theory of relativity, could it have been different?

815
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,000
What is the freedom to change that theory at all?

816
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,400
Could there have been any other theory of gravity that could have worked?

817
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,040
What does it have to do with the outstanding of what the word symmetry means?

818
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:04,360
Right. So the idea behind symmetries is that if I tell you about the rules for what I can do for a

819
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,160
theory and leave it alone, that is equivalent to specifying the theory.

820
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:16,519
So for example, if you want to ask how do the laws, how are the laws of physics impacted by the

821
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:21,719
fact that if I do an experiment here, and then I move that experiment five feet to the left and do

822
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:26,440
the same experiment, I should get the same answer, right? What is that? The implication of that for

823
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,440
the laws of physics? It turns out that that phenomena that, you know, the laws of physics shouldn't

824
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,599
care whether your laboratory is here versus five feet to the left, that's very much linked to

825
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,920
something like the conservation of momentum in classical physics. Or the fact that you should

826
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,079
do an experiment today and get the same answer tomorrow is related to the idea that energy is

827
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,839
conserved in classical physics. So all of the sort of can I shift something, you know, in some

828
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,039
concrete way? There I talked about, you know, moving an experiment or doing the same experiment at

829
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,400
different points in time. But in more general, you can say if I could characterize all the different

830
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,480
ways that I can, you know, pick something up, turn it over, look at it, you know, shift its

831
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:07,000
description. And if it stays the same, that actually tells me what equations are compatible with

832
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,960
that in a really predictive way. I've got another symmetry here, mirror symmetry. So what do you have

833
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:19,800
for us there? So mirror symmetry was originally discovered in the context of these string compactifications.

834
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,440
So considering solutions of string theory that could lead to, you know, physics like we see in our

835
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,880
universe, that compact extra dimensions that people were trying to write down, they discovered that

836
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,440
all the solutions they could find seem to come in pairs. And these pairs involved interchanging

837
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:43,400
topological numbers. So a topological number is all the ways that you can change a geometry or

838
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,840
sorry, is characterized by all the ways you can change a geometry without intrinsically changing

839
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,840
what it is. So the classic example is that you can change a donut into a coffee cup. So you you

840
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,680
picture, you know, taking yourself a donut and if you imagine the material was all rubbery and you

841
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,639
could stretch it and squish it any way you want, but not cut it, how can you deform that shape

842
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:09,639
or change it or put another hole in it. And this is a coffee cup with a little finger hole with a

843
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:13,639
handle. Yeah, yeah, it wouldn't work if it didn't have a handle, right? Right. So it was just like a

844
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:17,000
drinking glass. It doesn't work. Yeah, not the coffee cup from Starbucks because that doesn't have a

845
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,159
handle. Right. Okay. The idea there is that a geometry with a single hole, you can't change the

846
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:26,839
number of holes, whether that's the center of the donut or if you could smoosh it around and turn

847
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,640
it into the handle of a coffee cup, that's what's called a topological invariant. So the number of

848
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:37,720
holes is one of these examples of topological numbers. So a donut has one hole, you could imagine,

849
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,960
you know, a donut that was built to have two holes and so on, you know, this this kind of thing

850
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,440
describes or characterizes geometry. So in mirror symmetry, all these geometries come with top

851
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,559
logical numbers, but any combinations you could have, it turns out you could have in more than one

852
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:57,719
configuration. And this again sort of divides the space of possible geometries it half in this case.

853
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:07,480
It tells you that all of them are interchangeable in concrete ways. Wow. Man, that is insane.

854
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:19,320
First of all, why? Why? It's a really great question. That's so crazy. I love it though, but I

855
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:24,920
got more here where we just we're just cracking this egg, you know, whatever I have a colabi,

856
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,920
y'all, manifolds. So these are examples of configurations for the shapes of extra dimensions in

857
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,840
the string theory that satisfy Einstein's equations. So these are the half a billion possibilities

858
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,600
that I was talking about. Okay. The manifolds are okay. They're now ready to get the word metaphor.

859
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,519
Yeah, you got that from Star Trek. Yeah.

860
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:43,480
Yeah.

861
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:51,400
After two very clever mathematicians, these manifolds were conjectured to exist by a mathematician

862
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,800
Imugin Klubbi and proved by Yao, who won a field's medal for his proof that these things

863
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,320
all Einstein's equations. Do you know about the field's medal? No, I don't.

864
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,199
So it's kind of like the Nobel Prize in mathematics. It's given to major substantive discoveries

865
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:11,880
in mathematics, but the catch is you got to be under 40 to get it. So you have to be young and clever.

866
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:18,519
Of course, the mathematicians wait use chronology as a determining fact.

867
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:22,599
Yeah, discriminating. It's just ages. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

868
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:29,400
Homological field mirror symmetry. So this is an example of something where there was a

869
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,719
dialogue between string theory and mathematics that was really fruitful. So these observations about

870
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:38,199
Klubbi and manifolds in their topology were first observed in string theory and mathematicians

871
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:42,759
went away and tried to sort of explain why that was happening and found a correspondence between

872
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:46,919
a lot of deeper mathematical structures that actually led to another field's medal for a gentleman

873
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:52,199
named Konsevich. It's Maxim Konsevich. Maxim Konsevich. That sounds Russian. Yeah. Yeah.

874
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,519
Yeah. So this type of structure, you know, this dialogue between mathematics and physics,

875
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:00,599
I personally think is really fruitful. We've learned a lot from mathematicians from building

876
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,519
these kinds of things. And then the fun question that I'm asking recently is, you know, could there

877
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:08,519
be new variants of this? They could lead to new physics, new predictions for particle physics,

878
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:12,679
but also new mathematical structures. So some of the dualities we're looking at right now involve

879
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:19,079
not just changing two manifolds or two configurations of geometry, but actually mixing things like

880
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:24,920
electromagnetic fields in those backgrounds with geometry. So there's also it's a weird and wonderful,

881
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,800
you know, mixing of possible degrees of freedom in the theory that could still magically leave the

882
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,880
physics alone. There's surely plenty of physicists out there who are perfectly trained in all their

883
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:41,880
physics, but don't have your math background. So in a way, they're kind of researching with blinders

884
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,480
on given how much more you see in the mathematical regimes. Is that a fair characterization here?

885
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,640
The pushback somebody might say, you know, you're sort of torturing yourself by trying to solve really

886
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,640
hard problems in math and physics at the same time. So there are lots of questions where you don't

887
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:01,079
need this degree of math. But unfortunately, the path to the physical questions we want to answer

888
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,759
leads through this crazy, hairy geometry and high dimensions to be able to answer the physics we

889
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:11,639
want in string theory. So we kind of don't have a choice. This is a Volkswagen Einstein, where I don't

890
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:17,319
think he was totally up on non-uclidean geometry. differential geometry. He wasn't totally up on

891
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:22,359
that and needed some help, right? Even though he had the physics. I would love to meet Einstein's

892
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:30,760
tutor. What do you do? I tutor Einstein's geometry. That's all. Yeah.

893
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:40,519
This marriage of frontier physics and emergent math, I mean, this is, it's been going since the very

894
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:47,079
beginning. And I might offer a cosmic perspective on that as we close it out. All right. One of the

895
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:55,480
features of research scientists in academia is it really smart people working on problems where there's

896
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,159
no obligation or expectation that there's a sellable product at the end of that exercise.

897
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:09,400
What it means is that the mind can roam freely on the boundaries of what is known and unknown

898
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:16,840
in the universe. And in physics that has always occurred, has always occurred in tandem with

899
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:22,280
advances in mathematics. You go back to ancient Greece to try to measure the shape of the earth,

900
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:29,320
is it round, is it not? The word geometry gets introduced. And if you look at what that means,

901
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:37,559
it means earth measurement, geometry. And so you look at this juxtaposition of our advances in science

902
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:42,519
and our advances in mathematics. And these are two fields that so often people in school say,

903
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:47,400
I don't not get it math and I'm good at physics. And I'm going to mean while is the foundation of our

904
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:55,400
understanding of our place and existence in this universe. So I look forward to further advances on

905
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:00,599
the frontier of physics and how they marry with further advances in mathematics, no matter how

906
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:07,400
obscure it might look to the passerby. One day in the end, you'll be living with it as we

907
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:14,920
currently are with all the trappings of modern engineering, technology, and society at large.

908
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,480
And that's a cosmic perspective. So Lara, I mean, this has been a delightful conversation. We've

909
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:31,400
learned a lot or you've told us a lot. Maybe I learned maybe two thirds of it. What's your

910
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,639
fraction of it? I am just as dumb as I have been. But I feel smart. There you go. That's all

911
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:44,119
it matter. And so again, for genutech and you teach a course on general relativity, Einstein's

912
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:49,559
relativity, love it. So you are pure theorist, right? So you don't, they don't invite you into the

913
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,200
particle accelerators, right? I have been invited, but I'm kept on a very short leash and then let

914
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:00,280
out again. So I was on a mountain once observing in the mountains of Chile, and invited a theorist to

915
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:05,240
come. And when he came, there was an earthquake. Wow. So that he's never invited back. Yeah, this is

916
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:11,240
what we said. It was clear. The theorists are just get out of my get out of my lab. Do you know

917
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,680
what you end on the telescope to look for? You know, no, it's a fun riff over time. But we know we need

918
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,080
each other. Yes, yes. So thanks again, Lara, for being on start talk and Chuck, always good to have you,

919
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,360
man. Always a pleasure. All right. This has been start talk. String theory edition,

920
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,720
Neil the Grass Tyson. Keep looking up.
