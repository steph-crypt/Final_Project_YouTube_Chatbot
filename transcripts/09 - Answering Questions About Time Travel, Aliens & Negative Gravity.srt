1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
Pure life form on a pristine planet. What is the first question you would ask exploratory humans?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,839
So first, let me say, go to an old episode of the Twilight Zone called The Invaders.

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,480
In that episode Agnes Morehead is this lone ranch woman on her little house in the prairie.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,320
And you just have to watch that. It's called The Invaders. Point is, if I'm the other life form and I see humans,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
my first question would be, have you come to colonize this planet?

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,120
Because if that's your goal, that's not happening.

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
This is Star Talk. Neil deGrasse Tyson here, your personal astrophysicist.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,679
We did do cosmic queries today. Captain, I have Paul MacKurio, Paul.

9
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,479
What's up, my friend? Welcome back to Star Talk. Great to see you.

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,159
What'd you do with Chuck? What'd you do? What'd you do?

11
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,920
You know, he's in a bag somewhere.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,959
Last time, Chuck, he was breathing. He was still breathing.

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,960
So how you been, man?

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm good. I miss you. I miss you still doing the late show with...

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,719
Doing the late show with Michael Bear. I just had another appearance on that.

16
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,120
I've been touring with my Broadway show Permission to Speak, directed by Frank Oz.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,039
Frank Oz? He's the voice of Yoda.

18
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:22,480
He's a man, as they say. He's a great, it's just a brilliant artist.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,840
We love him. Yeah, he's been on our show. You'll find him in our archives.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,040
He's amazing. And you'll see all the breadth and depth of all that he is.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Oh, the Muppet creator with Jim Henson, the Muppet creator, Miss Piggy and Fuzzy Bear,

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
directed everybody from Marlon Brando to Robert De Niro to me. I don't know what that's about.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,439
He's really a stil-

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,719
What was that? I think he's living in a car by the river.

25
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,000
We love... So this is a grab bag.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
There's a grab bag. We love these. I haven't seen them before.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
If I don't know the answer, I'll just say I don't know.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
Yeah, oh, you know. You always need answers.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
No. Okay, here we go.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Eric Crosjado-T, Dr. Tyson in Duke,

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Macuria. Wow.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,680
And everyone called a Duke before.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Oh, because Chuck is called Lord.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,920
Oh, Lord Knight.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
Oh, I didn't. Oh, okay.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Okay, why have he got a title?

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,319
I'm a Duke now. There we go.

38
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh, I hope that matters at home with my wife.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
What are you, Duke of Earl?

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
I can't do it.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
What do you do, Duke of Earl?

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
All right. They got Lord.

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Duke, Duke.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Yo, you can do that. I can't do that.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,520
I can't do Duke. Duke, Duke of Earl.

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
We're going to just do this for 30 minutes.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
Duke of Earl.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,920
And he got to come in high.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,200
Give me some falsetto. Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,520
We'll find out what your Duke of Earl will come up with something.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,400
All right, okay.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
Greetings from Mangajila, Pennsylvania,

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
regarding the idea of time travel in star position.

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Hypothetically, if I were to create a time machine,

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,520
it's time to go back to Mangajila 2,000 years ago,

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,240
what I not end up in empty space

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
because the entire solar system would not have arrived in that location

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,240
had I departed that I had departed from.

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Every time machine is also a space machine.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
There's space time machine.

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,000
They don't say it, but they have to be.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,040
Why is that relevant?

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,920
Why does that matter?

64
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,960
They have to be.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Now, they got around that in back to the future,

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
because when Marty is trying to escape from the Libyan terrorists,

67
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,200
and he jumps in the DeLorean,

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
and he's quickly typing the date,

69
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
he typed 1955,

70
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
but it's the same day of the year as he leaves.

71
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
So he goes back to 1955,

72
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,280
Earth is in the same part of its orbit around the sun.

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,319
Because of the date.

74
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
The date was the same.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
So they skirted.

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
But that can't be true because of the year.

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
Hang on. So they dodged that bullet a little bit.

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Had it been six months earlier or later,

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
he just plopped in the vacuum of space, maybe dead.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,159
So the reason why they dodged that bullet is because the entire solar system

81
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,719
is also orbiting the center of the galaxy.

82
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,439
Having to pick the exact date that was the key there.

83
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,879
Well, only for the moving coordinate system that is the solar system.

84
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,920
But because the whole solar system is moving,

85
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,519
he goes back 30 years, he's leaving our solar system today.

86
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,240
And if he only moved in time,

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,639
he would be where our solar system is today, 30 years ago.

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,599
But he also moved in.

89
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,000
Well ahead of where the solar system would have gotten,

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,159
the solar system would need another 30 years to catch up.

91
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:33,360
But he also moved in space as your point, not just in time.

92
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,079
Which is why he landed in exactly the same spot on Earth.

93
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,800
So it's implicit in the storytelling.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
So you're absolutely right.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
Nothing you can't do that in any way that makes sense.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,079
But wait, if our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago,

97
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,520
isn't the premise part of his question has a false premise,

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,480
which is I would not end up in this because the entire solar system

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,639
would not have arrived in the location.

100
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,480
Solar system is there in that location.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,080
No, no, no, no.

102
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
We are in a rotating galaxy.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
The Milky Way is rotating.

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
And so that is all the stars in the Milky Way

105
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,599
are rotating around our central black hole in the center.

106
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,759
So if you go back in time,

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,839
if you go back in time,

108
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,000
you are no longer where you left in space.

109
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,560
And you'll be dropped in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,799
So you always have to land in a space time coordinate in the future.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
We sort of do that, but without the relativity part,

112
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
if you're going to visit Mars,

113
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,319
you don't aim for where Mars is.

114
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,519
You aim for where Mars will be when you get there.

115
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,360
Then you intersect Mars.

116
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,039
So if you're going back 2000 years,

117
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,800
it will be an empty seat.

118
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,319
Well, there's going to be a home depot

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,199
because they existed in a subway sandwich shop.

120
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,639
They've been around.

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,599
In the mall.

122
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,039
They're franchising methodologies as brilliant.

123
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
And they never get enough credit.

124
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,000
What you need is,

125
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
you have to know where was the solar system

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
and the earth 2000 years ago.

127
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,800
And not only move back in time,

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,079
but move back to that location.

129
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,560
But you cannot say that the Manga Hila would not be the Manga Hila 2000 years ago.

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,599
Why wouldn't it be?

131
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,159
Why would not it be exactly what it is today?

132
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,159
The Manga Hila sounds like native tribe.

133
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:16,639
It is.

134
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,360
That's who would be there.

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,199
2000 years ago.

136
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
He's asking if I created time machine,

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,919
if I could go back to Manga Hila,

138
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,000
would I not end up in an empty space?

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Yes.

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
He would unless he moved in time.

141
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,560
That's why I've been spending the last 10 minutes describing it.

142
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,599
I understand that.

143
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,520
So you answered his question.

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,240
Yes.

146
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
Unless he also moves back into space.

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,720
Space as well.

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,280
Correct.

149
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Yeah.

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay.

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,720
And

152
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,080
yes.

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,920
So every time machine is also a space machine.

154
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
Otherwise, it would be quite lethal.

155
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
Most of the time.

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,920
What would happen?

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,080
No, you're dropped into middle of space.

158
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Because everything is moving.

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
You got to move with the action.

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,280
Okay.

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
Margo Lane.

162
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,480
If you were a life form on a pristine planet

163
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
watching exploratory humans arrive for the first time.

164
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,320
So you're observing humans arrive for the first time.

165
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,640
Yes.

166
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,800
What is the first question you'd ask them?

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,640
Assume you could understand each other.

168
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,240
And I have the answer to this.

169
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
My question would be,

170
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
really, you needed to sketch your shoes

171
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,400
where you don't have to bend over to put them on.

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
That's where you were.

173
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
That makes you so hard to see if you commercial.

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,879
That's where they forget about that.

175
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,000
That's where we are.

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
There's a species.

177
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,960
A lot of questions to Kardashians.

178
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,439
What?

179
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,920
Why?

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,400
Really?

181
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,120
What's up with that?

182
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
How do people who make Vaseline make any money?

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Think about it.

184
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
I've had the same tub of Vaseline.

185
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,599
My Vaseline was handed down in the middle

186
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,120
by my grandfather in a will.

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,959
I don't think you want to understand

188
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,560
these conceptual...

189
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
Okay, here we go.

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,159
So I think people used to use Vaseline

191
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,519
before lotion was big.

192
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,240
I used it to grease the brakes on my car.

193
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
I still have a giant battery.

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
The tub of Vaseline are not as...

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,319
You know.

196
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,879
You could go through 30,000 bags of garbage.

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
You're not going to find one empty container of Vaseline.

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,439
All right.

199
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,439
So if you were a life form on a pristine planet

200
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,199
watching exploratory humans arrive,

201
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,920
what is the first question you would ask

202
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,439
exploratory humans?

203
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:01,680
Okay.

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
So first, let me say that you should look online,

205
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,680
maybe Pluto TV or one of these things that has old TV in it.

206
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,599
Meet TV?

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,079
Meet TV?

208
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah, but there's several others as well.

209
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,839
Go to an old episode of the Twilight Zone

210
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,599
called The Invaders.

211
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
That's all I will say.

212
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,199
Why watch a lot of Twilight Zone?

213
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
Trying to remember which one that is.

214
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
So in that episode Agnes Morehead is this lone

215
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
ranch woman on a little house in the prairie.

216
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,159
And the whole...

217
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a one woman show.

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,759
She's the only character in it.

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
And you just have to watch that.

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,320
It's called The Invaders.

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, I do remember this now.

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
It's called The Invaders.

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
Don't say anything about it.

224
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
Point is, if I'm the other life form and I see humans,

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
my first question would be just given

226
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
what I know about humans.

227
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
Have you come to colonize this point?

228
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Because if that's your goal,

229
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
that's not happening.

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
We will not let that happen.

231
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,640
Okay?

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Because we've seen what happens when you colonize stuff before.

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,440
Yeah.

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,920
Okay.

235
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,480
So that's the first point.

236
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
Second, that's interesting because

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
that implies that the humans

238
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
have more technology than the alien.

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
No, it doesn't.

240
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah, because all those aliens would have visited us first.

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,920
No, that's your...

242
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
Yeah, no, no.

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
No, no.

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,279
You're missing it.

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,799
The question you got to ask is

246
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,519
really you conveyed happiness by a little yellow circle

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
with a smiley face called an emoji.

248
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,759
Right?

249
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,759
There are so many bigger questions

250
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,279
that you could ask these people.

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,080
Yeah, that's true.

252
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,679
No, the colonization is a good point

253
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,000
because nothing good ever has really happened from that.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,639
It's good and...

255
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,120
How about this?

256
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,840
I would say,

257
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
how did you survive yourself

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
wouldn't enough

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,320
to then come visit another planet?

260
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,519
That's what I would...

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,919
What you would do is you would be hiding behind something

262
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,639
and you'd say,

263
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,079
how do you feel about brothers?

264
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,360
You know, you got to ask the black question

265
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,439
because if they're not with the thing,

266
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,039
no, maybe you just say,

267
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,480
what part of the...

268
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,199
are you from?

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,799
Oh, I see.

270
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,799
We have a part of the demographic.

271
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,240
Well, if you see them go stepping down toward you,

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
you probably know if you're a Jew or a Black person.

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,799
You may want to let them just pass.

274
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,000
Or Gypsy's or Catholic's or...

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Gypsy's or...

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
Or pretty much anybody.

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
Anyone non-arion.

280
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,919
Wouldn't you ask them how you got there,

281
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,559
though, seriously?

282
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,240
What was your technology that got you to watch?

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,919
I assume they would see them land in something.

284
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,320
No, no, but you'd want to learn from that.

285
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,159
As a scientist, I would compare notes.

286
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,919
And I would do things.

287
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,080
There's certain things that should be common between us

288
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,159
even if we don't otherwise...

289
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,240
What is this thing you call tang?

290
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
Like that kind of thing?

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,679
So, but how would I know that, though?

292
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,320
That's what I'm saying.

293
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I don't know the tang or the Kardashians

294
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
or slip-on skitches.

295
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
I don't...

296
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Unless he shows up drinking tang.

297
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
Do you have to ruin every joke and party with your stupid logic?

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,680
With a Kardashian underarm and slip-on skitcher.

299
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
Then I could ask, what's up with that?

300
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
Why can't you presume that this life form is smarter

301
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
and has the ability to see what we've been doing?

302
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Here's what I would say.

303
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
I want to compare science notes.

304
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Because science transcends time and space

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
in which culture does not.

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
But it doesn't transcend Instagram.

307
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,759
If you got a big following, it's all that matters.

308
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:27,039
So, if I verify that they can see

309
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,199
in the same wavelength as light that I can see,

310
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,039
they could have completely different senses.

311
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,480
Well, I was going to think, say, medically,

312
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,799
you'd probably want to check each other out, too, right?

313
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,159
Not first.

314
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,360
No, I don't mean that...

315
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
Start poking their bodies first.

316
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,399
No, I didn't mean it in that way.

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,199
What?

318
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,599
No, I'm not talking about anal probes or anything.

319
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm just saying...

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,439
I knew thought of that.

321
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
I'll give the alien a bad name now.

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,080
No, I'm saying...

323
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
No, why wouldn't...

324
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
If you want to check out their mind

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
and compare notes in terms of science,

326
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
wouldn't you physically...

327
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,560
I would physically want to understand their bodies

328
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
versus vis-a-vis my vessel.

329
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
Their vers-vessel?

330
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,000
No, seriously.

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
If I were biologists, yes, but I'm a physicist.

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
So, no.

333
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
I'd compare...

334
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
I'd pull out a periodic table of the elements.

335
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,360
Because that organization is universal.

336
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
Anyone who knows the elements well enough,

337
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,640
as well as we do, would organize them that way.

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,879
Okay, but what if somebody that landed was like a

339
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,319
write a creative writing major and didn't care about science?

340
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,960
If they were the first emissary to another planet,

341
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
I'm pretty sure they would have given them some science.

342
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
Yeah, you're just a science snob.

343
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,679
Oh, only where the ones that everybody cares about.

344
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,559
Hello, Neil and Paul.

345
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,519
This is Julie and Ray.

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
Atlanta native writing from downtown Manhattan.

347
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
My question relates to stars in black holes.

348
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
I understand that our sun belongs to the third generation

349
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
of stars since the Big Bang.

350
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,960
Each star will eventually die out

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
in an explosion, some of which form black holes.

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,879
And then in eternal singularity of their mass,

353
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,800
is it possible that in the distant future

354
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
there will be more black holes than stars

355
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
since their lifespan is so much longer than that of a star?

356
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Could the passage of time create a population of black holes

357
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,759
that outlive and nearly replace stars?

358
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,720
Yes.

359
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,759
Next question.

360
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,720
Okay.

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
That was a...

362
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
So, it turns out, according to Stephen Hawking,

363
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
black holes actually evaporate,

364
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,199
but very, very, very slowly.

365
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,799
So it's not burnout, it's evaporated.

366
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,599
It's a different...

367
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,039
Yeah, yeah, they wouldn't burn out.

368
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,639
Very, very, very slowly.

369
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,799
So there's a point where all the stars burn out

370
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,120
and they leave their corpses,

371
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
some of those corpses are black holes.

372
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
And they will come a time when the black hole...

373
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,679
black holes outnumber the living stars.

374
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,799
They will never outnumber the corpse.

375
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,319
But isn't the black hole then like...

376
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,399
It's like the Alice in the Brady Bunch

377
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
with a giant vacuum cleaner.

378
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,159
It's like sucking up all of the stars

379
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,799
that whether they evaporate or not.

380
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,120
I don't...

381
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,319
Alice in the Brady Bunch.

382
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,519
Yeah, the housekeeper.

383
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,319
Is that what she did?

384
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,120
She was...

385
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,240
She would back you.

386
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,879
The black holes?

387
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:52,799
Yeah.

388
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,159
I'm sorry, I can't connect.

389
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,959
I'm sorry.

390
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,399
But do you see...

391
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
Where was Alice in the grid of nine squares?

392
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,319
She was in the center.

393
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:00,879
She was in the center.

394
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,839
And if you notice,

395
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,720
her image kept repeating back and forth.

396
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,600
Because it ended up taking off.

397
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
She was a pretty short loop.

398
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,279
Right.

399
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,720
And I got annoyed by it.

400
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,960
It's the same thing in the Mad Mad Mad Mad World.

401
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,759
Yeah.

402
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,040
I just saw it last night.

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,759
Really?

404
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,399
No, I'm serious.

405
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,040
Okay, I know every...

406
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,240
So there's the name of that movie.

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,639
Okay, so there's the shot when at the end,

408
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,759
Spencer Tracy is hanging onto the edge.

409
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,960
He slides down a cable and goes through a window

410
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,759
and is sitting there and a great dain is looking his face.

411
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,960
Yeah, and that to repeat it.

412
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
And it's a repeated and it was annoying me as well.

413
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Ah!

414
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't know how he got off on that.

415
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,759
But it's like, and he's doing this with his eyes,

416
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,480
move the same way.

417
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,520
But is it possible they're already more black holes

418
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,600
than stars in our universe?

419
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,840
No, because we know who the progenitor is of a black hole.

420
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,000
And it's a star that's made one out of 10,000 stars.

421
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,440
One in a million stars.

422
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,240
It's the most massive of stars as a black hole.

423
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,960
And in any volume of gas that creates stars,

424
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,080
it creates a lot of low-mass stars and fewer middle-mass stars

425
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
and very few high-mass stars.

426
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
So is this like a cosmic game of high-and-seek?

427
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,080
Well, it's called the initial mass function,

428
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
specifically.

429
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
And the initial mass function favors low-mass stars

430
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,280
and high-mass stars are just rare.

431
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,240
Rare.

432
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,080
And I don't know the latest iteration on the initial mass function,

433
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,480
but it's at least as rare as one in a thousand stars.

434
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,400
That what?

435
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,559
Are massive enough to make a black hole at the end of its life.

436
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,480
So all I'm saying is we have stars today that are born out of these

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
pockets of gas that are still alive and thriving

438
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,799
and we've only had one or two black holes.

439
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:49,039
So no, black holes do not outnumber stars.

440
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,279
By the way, they will outnumber stars in a trillion years,

441
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
the few trillion years, when the lowest mass stars burn out their fuel.

442
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,639
It sounds like stars need like a support group of black holes

443
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,840
in a way to get out with.

444
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,879
Now, that'll be fine.

445
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,399
Black holes need no support.

446
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,240
The more black holes that develop,

447
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,440
we're all in jeopardy, no?

448
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,920
I just avoid them, that's all.

449
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,639
Well, but what you do emotionally in your relationships

450
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,960
to other people is not what's relevant here.

451
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,879
Yeah, we just need a map of where all the black holes are

452
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,720
and then step around them.

453
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,360
That's...

454
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
Especially in your time machine.

455
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
You don't want your time machine to land in a black hole

456
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,879
because you didn't type in the right space time coordinate.

457
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
All right, let's move on.

458
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
I think we answered that thoroughly.

459
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
Seizard Fredique from Bogota, Columbia.

460
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,519
Love it.

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,879
Uh, Speed of Light.

462
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,080
See, shapes our reality and its fundamental properties.

463
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,320
However, it is intriguing to consider that

464
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,800
regardless of the unit used,

465
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,080
see could potentially be half double or any other value.

466
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,639
Could you suggest factors other than the possibility of it being an imposed

467
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
constraint within a simulation that might determine

468
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,920
the seemingly arbitrary value of this universal constant

469
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,040
as we understand it?

470
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,480
Wow.

471
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,680
Here's a couple of speed of light facts.

472
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,399
299 million, 792,440 meters per second.

473
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,639
Yes.

474
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,480
Yes.

475
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,839
And do you know where the C comes from?

476
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,319
The Latin word speed?

477
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,960
C stands for constant.

478
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,279
Yeah, but do you think that there's a speculation

479
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,159
from a 1922 historian and scientist that's

480
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,279
it's salitrious.

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,279
The Latin for speed.

482
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,879
That's the first I've heard of that.

483
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Well, that's why I'm here to open your horizon.

484
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
That's the first I've heard of that.

485
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,440
It's true.

486
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
First I've heard of that.

487
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
That doesn't mean it's not.

488
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
It's the most fundamental constant in the universe.

489
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Right.

490
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,080
And the word constant begins with a C.

491
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,720
I understand.

492
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
So, but there's that obviously.

493
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,760
So, if I'm wrong,

494
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,960
I'd be intrigued to learn that that's what was really going on.

495
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,360
Okay.

496
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,680
It's not just an after the fact suggestion.

497
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,480
Okay.

498
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
So, the units are arbitrary,

499
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,200
completely arbitrary.

500
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,400
You said you're, how tall you five nine?

501
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,120
Mm-hmm.

502
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
If I measured your height in units of five nine

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
this, then how tall you?

504
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Those units, those number of units of five nine.

505
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,559
If I have a new unit that's five feet nine inches.

506
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
And I'm one unit.

507
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,920
You're one.

508
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

509
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,720
So, your point being...

510
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
That doesn't make you shorter or tall or anything.

511
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
But your point because...

512
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm saying that the units are arbitrary,

513
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
but the speed that we're measuring is not.

514
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
That is real and it's fundamental.

515
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,720
So, the units don't matter.

516
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,240
And so, precisely, do we understand the speed of light?

517
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,120
It's been measured so precisely

518
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,880
that it defines the length of the meter.

519
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,920
That's how well we know the speed of light.

520
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,839
So, if we get another pointer precision

521
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,680
in the measurement of the speed of light,

522
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,920
it affects the definition of the length of the meter.

523
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
So, you can vary that.

524
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
Well, only in the points where it's still uncertain, that's correct.

525
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
But it's the most amazing fundamental thing there is.

526
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,440
So, there is no inherent...

527
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
There cannot be any inherent uncertainty around the speed of light.

528
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,280
That's what you're saying.

529
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,920
Whatever uncertainty there is, it's smaller than our capacity to measure it.

530
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Then how do you know that there is uncertainty if you can't measure it?

531
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,800
There is always uncertainty in every measurement.

532
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,240
How do we know that?

533
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
Always.

534
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,080
How do we know that?

535
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,919
So, I'll tell you again.

536
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,480
Five nine.

537
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,399
Are you five nine in a quarter?

538
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,319
Are you five eight in three quarters?

539
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,720
Are you five eight in seven eighths?

540
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,720
Are you five nine in one eighths?

541
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
You five nine in one sixteenths?

542
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
How can you give it to me in units of inches?

543
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,720
You've approximated.

544
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,519
Haven't you?

545
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,119
Well, it depends on what sucks I'm wearing.

546
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,599
You have approximated it.

547
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,679
So, now I measure it five nine.

548
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,159
Let's say you're exactly five nine five feet nine inches.

549
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,039
What does that even mean?

550
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,240
The thickness of the line that's the nine inches above the five feet,

551
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,359
where are you within the thickness of that line?

552
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,759
Are you five eight and ninety nine one hundred seven inch?

553
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,039
Are you five nine and one one thousandth of an inch?

554
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,119
Are you saying exactitude is impossible?

555
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,440
Correct.

556
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,200
Oh, you can't agree where?

557
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,559
You can never measure something exactly.

558
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,440
Is that it because of the space time continuum?

559
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
No, it's what's called measurement errors.

560
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,279
But they're not errors.

561
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,559
They're just measurement uncertainties.

562
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,759
So, if you were once five eight and then you're later on five ten,

563
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,519
there was a point in your life where you were exactly five nine,

564
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
but you could have never measured it to be so.

565
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,440
Right.

566
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,759
All you could do is measure it and bracket it

567
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,000
according to the uncertainties of your measuring device.

568
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,079
Right now I'm exactly five nine.

569
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,639
I felt it.

570
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,639
It was a little vibration.

571
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,519
Little vibration.

572
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,639
So, measurements are never exact.

573
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:49,599
And they never can be.

574
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,639
And they never will be.

575
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,119
That's correct.

576
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,039
You can only know them with greater precision.

577
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,359
And your how tall?

578
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,839
At my tallest six two.

579
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,639
But you shrinking.

580
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,839
Yeah, I'm probably shrinking.

581
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,039
Is that your spine collapsing?

582
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,799
The discs between your spine and stomach.

583
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,119
Fluid.

584
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,799
Yeah, but you can go into space and grow in interso.

585
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,319
But your space suit that you walk in and the space walk

586
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,039
is made taller than the one you took off in.

587
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,679
Why are we growing?

588
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,719
Because gravity that...

589
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,240
Gravity's no longer squashing you.

590
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,519
So the atoms are getting strength.

591
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,319
Yeah, molecules.

592
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,120
The stress is out.

593
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,680
Right.

594
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,599
So, I'm probably six one and three quarters now, I guess.

595
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,559
You are, as they say in science, a tall drink of water.

596
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
All right, here we go.

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,079
Doesn't that mean you have great affection for me?

598
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,039
No, it's no bounds.

599
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,960
It's boundless.

600
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,000
All right, Stefan Summers.

601
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,200
This is from Heston, Kansas.

602
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
I was making my way through your old...

603
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,839
You're a small town.

604
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,319
I love it.

605
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:46,799
Yeah.

606
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:47,359
Okay.

607
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,879
Making my way through your old queries and found one

608
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:51,599
where you talked about how if we could pass through wormholes

609
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,960
then gravity would as well.

610
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,879
But my understanding is that gravity is the warping of space

611
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,039
and since a wormhole is making a hole

612
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,440
through the dimension of space would it be warped on the other side?

613
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,599
Furthermore, if a wormhole is a literal hole

614
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,559
through a dimension, would we be able to pass through it

615
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
or even perceive it as being...

616
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,960
as beings who live within our three-dimensional space?

617
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,240
Wow.

618
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,879
You know what it's...

619
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:22,879
That sounds like he wants to write another of the sequel to...

620
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:23,039
Does it...

621
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,079
Do you want me to repeat anything?

622
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,799
No, no, no, no.

623
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,279
He wants to write the sequel to interstellar.

624
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,879
That's what he's trying to do there.

625
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:29,519
Exactly.

626
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
So a wormhole uses...

627
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
If we were to make one, it uses negative gravity.

628
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
So we know how to make a wormhole.

629
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,839
We just don't have the substance to make it happen.

630
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,679
Gravity collapses space time on itself.

631
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,319
Negative gravity, if we could...

632
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:50,799
negative matter, would pry open space time.

633
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,559
It creates a shortcut through.

634
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,679
So if we did that,

635
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,119
we, in principle, should be able to position it in such a way

636
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,399
that pops a hole through the fabric of space and time.

637
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:03,279
And you step through and you're instantly on the other side.

638
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,639
Which, by the way, would have rendered

639
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:07,279
transporters completely obsolete in Star Trek?

640
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,319
Think about it.

641
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
Just stuff through a wormhole to get down to the planet.

642
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,359
Yeah, but there's no guarantee you're going to get through without getting lost.

643
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,359
It's like Google Maps and you take a right

644
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,799
and it's something you're in a quarantine situation.

645
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,679
I'll take that chance...

646
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,359
Because you don't pay attention to Google Maps.

647
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,599
I'll take that chance over

648
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,599
dematerializing my body into energy

649
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,159
and rematerializing it back into matter on the other side.

650
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
Why do you think that that's not possible?

651
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,480
Because you're like...

652
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,240
You know, it ends up on your...

653
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
I know.

654
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,519
Anything.

655
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,639
Anything.

656
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,880
My thoughts, my memories,

657
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,720
stored in the synapses of my brain.

658
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
I don't know what's going to do that.

659
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe you could help.

660
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,200
Let's say you misplaced your keys all the time.

661
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,920
Suddenly things...

662
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,360
You can shake it up arranged.

663
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,040
You know, you can shake it up all the time.

664
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,480
That's a possibility.

665
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,680
But the brain is so complex,

666
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm guessing that if you dematerialize it

667
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,920
and rematerialize it,

668
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,160
chances are you'll mess it up rather than improve it.

669
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,280
Okay, but if we're 3D and a wormhole is in another dimension,

670
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,240
how do we even know what's there?

671
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
It's like trying to change a flat,

672
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,720
knowing where the car is.

673
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,359
We see the part of the wormhole

674
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,279
that intersects our dimensionality.

675
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,680
But it's only part of the wormhole.

676
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,879
Well, so here's an example I gave

677
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:15,680
in another show.

678
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,480
If we live in a flat sheet of paper,

679
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
and then we just stand in a round

680
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,160
and we see a dot just appear out of nowhere,

681
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
then dot becomes a small circle,

682
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,839
and then a big circle,

683
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,639
which is watching this.

684
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,400
And then it shrinks back again,

685
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,879
becomes a dot and then disappears.

686
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,559
That'd be freaky.

687
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,160
No, that's called a Vegas Act.

688
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,599
It's a magician.

689
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,639
He works at the lounge.

690
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:39,759
Completely freaky.

691
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,400
Elijah.

692
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
What you just witnessed was a three-dimensional sphere

693
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
passing through the two dimensions of your world.

694
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,119
And you described it as a point,

695
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,480
and then circles that grew

696
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,079
until the circle was as wide as the diameter

697
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,000
of this sphere.

698
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,920
And then it went back and then disappeared

699
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,359
as it passed through to the other side.

700
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,719
So, higher-dimensional things passing

701
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,119
through our dimensionality will manifest

702
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,799
in some way or another.

703
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,119
So in answering this question,

704
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,240
then the answer is,

705
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,879
if a wormhole is a literal hole through a dimension,

706
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,159
will we be able to pass through it

707
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,759
or even perceive it as being,

708
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,439
as beings who live

709
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,279
within our three dimensions?

710
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:21,759
Yeah.

711
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,639
You can perceive it.

712
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,519
You would see the part of the wormhole

713
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,359
that intersected our dimensionality.

714
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,240
But nothing more than that.

715
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,319
You want to appreciate all of what also is going on there.

716
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,799
The fact that it moves into a fourth dimension,

717
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,680
you're not going to catch that.

718
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,039
But if you're passing through a wormhole,

719
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,839
you're going to instantly get to the other side.

720
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,079
Instantly.

721
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,839
Instantly.

722
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,399
So, movies like showing that you're going through this tunnel,

723
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:44,720
you know, it's like in the water park.

724
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,119
No, it's correctly done in Rick and Morty.

725
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,519
Which is exactly why I watch Rick and Morty

726
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,799
for my science knowledge.

727
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,159
And this dude, what's his name?

728
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,879
Dr. Strange.

729
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,919
Do you know what I'm talking about?

730
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
I would, if I had a super power,

731
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,759
I just would want to be able to do that.

732
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,960
It's a very sophisticated,

733
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,680
undistinguished state.

734
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
It's not this.

735
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,680
It's not trying too hard.

736
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,080
It's like,

737
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
Yeah, I mean, I prefer the Rick and Morty.

738
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
The wormholes because Rick uses real science.

739
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,759
And what is it about that wormhole and Rick and Morty

740
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,960
that's accurate to?

741
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
No, he just uses real science.

742
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,759
Whereas Dr. Strange uses magic.

743
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,960
If you can't pursue the wormhole,

744
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,519
aren't we in a way like walking through life like this?

745
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,279
Tourists that have lost the New York City

746
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,879
just looking up, taking pictures at everything?

747
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:33,839
Yes.

748
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,720
And isn't there a way that science can sort of make us

749
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
not feel that way?

750
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,519
Deal with it.

751
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,240
You can't become a scientist unless you are comfortable

752
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
being steeped in ignorance.

753
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
Okay, so we have this constant debate.

754
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
This is where you just like try to get off on

755
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,519
being lazy and not trying to get stuff right.

756
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,559
No, I want to get stuck right.

757
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh, it's better to not know anything.

758
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
All right, let's go have a bottle of wine.

759
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
No, it's

760
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
learn to love the questions themselves.

761
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,080
Oh my God.

762
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,000
I went through law school.

763
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,559
I don't need this.

764
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,559
I'll just answer a freaking question.

765
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,960
Will you talk to you about science?

766
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
Like looking at Picasso and then you're like,

767
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
whoa, why is it nose on his calf?

768
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,360
I don't know.

769
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,759
And then some some historian, artist

770
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,000
already has a theory and they're completely full of,

771
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,880
you know what?

772
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,039
Okay, you know what you're fired from science.

773
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,039
I don't think he ever put his nose on his calf.

774
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,319
Yes, he did.

775
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,440
All right, here we go.

776
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,080
Oh, this is Captain Carl with two Ks, everybody.

777
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
Oh, hey, Captain Carl from St. Thomas.

778
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
US Virgin Islands.

779
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
I've often wondered as a photographer and as physics

780
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,400
enthusiast is our colorful world a result of our white star.

781
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
White being made up of all colors.

782
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
What if our planet or any planet was orbiting a blue or red star?

783
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,680
What our world be different shades of red or blue?

784
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,680
By the way, I just want to thank you, Neil, and shout out to your comedic sidekicks.

785
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,520
So would our worlds be different shades of red or blue

786
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,040
for orbiting a blue or red star?

787
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,720
With our current eyes, yes.

788
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,559
But if we evolve there, there's no reason why our evolutionary path

789
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,200
wouldn't have taken, divided up the blue light into different subcategories.

790
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
Yeah, but if you have pure red, then tire, it's going to feel like a brothel.

791
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,360
Yeah, however, don't pretend you don't know what that is.

792
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,720
The width of our sensitivity to light is much greater than any single band of light.

793
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,160
Say that again, you lost me.

794
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,519
All right, so you have Roy G. Biv.

795
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
Do you know Roy G. Biv?

796
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,399
You don't know Roy?

797
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,959
Red, RGL, green, blue, indigo, violet.

798
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,559
Roy G. Biv.

799
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,039
Okay.

800
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,919
You know, you never know.

801
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,799
No, I never know.

802
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,759
I learn something every day.

803
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,039
Yeah, it's why I'm here.

804
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,119
Okay.

805
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:39,519
Okay, Roy G. Biv, we see all those colors.

806
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,679
Now, when we make color photos

807
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,719
by Hubble or the James Webb telescope

808
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,359
in the infrared part of the spectrum,

809
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,959
you can't see colors in the infrared part of the spectrum.

810
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,079
So you know what we do?

811
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,119
We take RGB,

812
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,119
slap it onto different wavelengths in the infrared part of the spectrum

813
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,679
and create a color photograph out of it.

814
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,119
That's what you would see if our site was shifted

815
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,480
to the infrared part of the spectrum.

816
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,319
It's what the world would look like.

817
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
So the infrared part of the spectrum

818
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,759
is it neutral in color?

819
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:13,919
You can't detect it at all.

820
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,359
But if we evolved to see it,

821
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,240
there's no reason to think our brain wouldn't assign colors to it.

822
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,519
That's what's going on here.

823
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,279
We're assigning colors.

824
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,480
In fact, Richard Dawkins,

825
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,399
the evolution of biologist,

826
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,639
thinks that bats actually, when they echolocate,

827
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,759
they see in color

828
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
because their mammal brain has that capacity.

829
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,960
So why not use it?

830
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,439
So when you're using echolocation,

831
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:41,839
tag it with a color.

832
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,199
So if we ordered it,

833
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,720
if we ordered it a blue star,

834
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,639
we'd still have, would we still have clear skies?

835
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:47,839
In other words, every style...

836
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,720
If we have our eyes evolved

837
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,240
in this star,

838
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,400
and then transport us to a blue star,

839
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
then we would not see colors

840
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
in the blue because we can only see colors

841
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
in the visible part of the spectrum.

842
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,400
There'd be blue and ultraviolet.

843
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
We only see colors in the visible part of the spectrum.

844
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,600
However, you can

845
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,120
fake it,

846
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
authentically fake it.

847
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
That's called the perfect Instagram filter.

848
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,480
So going in that direction,

849
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,120
we have violet.

850
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:22,159
Take three bands in violet light.

851
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,639
They're adjacent to one another.

852
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,000
Then once you do that,

853
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,119
you assign RGB,

854
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,399
bring them back together,

855
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,759
and you can reconstruct

856
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,039
what you would see

857
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
if our sensitivity were shifted

858
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,159
to the violet and ultraviolet part of the spectrum,

859
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,359
to the blue part of the spectrum.

860
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,559
So we should think of it as shifted color

861
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,759
is what it is.

862
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,479
But we only limited in how much we can...

863
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,599
Our abilities shift.

864
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,559
We're very limited.

865
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,079
Well, you are.

866
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:48,559
I'm not.

867
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,479
So we see red through violet.

868
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,119
That's it.

869
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,159
If you want to see color anywhere else,

870
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,519
you take out the RGB,

871
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,919
slap it down on three different bands,

872
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,519
and out comes a color picture

873
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,559
of x-rays,

874
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,599
of infrared,

875
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,399
of ultraviolet,

876
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
of gamma rays,

877
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,399
all the above.

878
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:09,519
And so,

879
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,119
a red planet,

880
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,000
a blue planet,

881
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,879
a red star,

882
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:13,679
a blue star,

883
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,000
is there any star

884
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,119
with a color

885
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,799
that you have the ability

886
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
to see without sort of

887
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,599
slapping our...

888
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:23,839
That doing that technique.

889
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,399
RBG.

890
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,039
Yeah, RBG.

891
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,680
Right.

892
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,399
Say it.

893
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,000
Roy G Bid.

894
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,879
Roy G Bid.

895
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:29,519
So no,

896
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,559
just the way we evolved,

897
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,639
we can't see into it.

898
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:33,519
So, by the way,

899
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,359
this band of visible light is very narrow

900
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,680
compared with ultraviolet or infrared.

901
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
Very narrow.

902
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,319
So,

903
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,000
we're practically blind no matter what.

904
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
And insects see into the deep

905
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,319
ultraviolet.

906
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:47,359
Insects.

907
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,159
And they're perfectly happy.

908
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,919
When I stare into a very bright light

909
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,679
and then I can't see for a second, what's happened?

910
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,399
That's a different thing.

911
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,159
You over stimulate the retinal cells

912
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,519
and they have to recover.

913
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,159
Yeah.

914
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,599
Which takes several seconds.

915
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,159
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,639
Yeah.

917
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,279
Which is always fun, by the way,

918
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,240
after you've been drinking.

919
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,399
All right, another question.

920
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,639
Hello, I'm John Mayhoy.

921
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,479
Mayhoy.

922
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,119
Mayhoy.

923
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:13,519
There you go.

924
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,000
And from Parkland, Florida.

925
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,680
I know that the Cosmic Mercury background is like a snapshot

926
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,960
of the early universe.

927
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,119
And its temperature has been dropping ever since.

928
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,200
So, I'm wondering, could this temperature be used

929
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,119
as a kind of universal clock?

930
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,519
If we could measure it super accurately,

931
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,400
would that tell us exactly how well the universe is right now?

932
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
Would that age be the same no matter what

933
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
where you are in the universe?

934
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:38,880
Yes.

935
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,279
Because every part of the universe was in the same place

936
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,079
at the same time, 13.8 billion years ago.

937
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,399
So, the oldest things in the universe

938
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,440
in every direction you look

939
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,639
are exactly the same age,

940
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,440
traceable to that period of time.

941
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,279
So, yeah, everything.

942
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,519
Now, at this moment,

943
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:01,920
we see in the past.

944
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,799
So, we can ask, what is that thing doing now?

945
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
Well, it's even farther away from us.

946
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,799
It's, and we can think of the diameter of the universe.

947
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,919
It's how big the universe is today, even though you can't see that.

948
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,919
And that diameter is coming in at 96, something like that,

949
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,759
billion miles, full diameter.

950
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,440
So, if you could see those galaxies out of horizon today,

951
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,559
that's what they look like.

952
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,159
But that would need an infinite speed of light.

953
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:29,440
And that's...

954
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,559
I'm not giving you that.

955
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:31,759
Why?

956
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,039
Not possible.

957
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,799
I'm not giving it to you.

958
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,559
Observational limits on the universe.

959
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,399
And temperatures the only way to measure this,

960
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,039
is to have a universal clock is temperature.

961
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,679
Temperature also works.

962
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,559
Yeah.

963
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,960
So, as the universe grows, the temperature cools.

964
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,440
So, it's a one-to-one correspondence.

965
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,879
So, you can just backstrapulate to the early universe.

966
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,159
So, there's a hard-to-serene.

967
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,480
And they do a forensic...

968
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,599
Why are you so morbid?

969
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,359
Well, because that's how my brain thinks.

970
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,480
And so, they get in it,

971
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,960
figure out based on the temperature of the body when the body died.

972
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,359
Yes.

973
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,880
So, that's what's happening there.

974
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,759
I hadn't thought about it that way, but that works.

975
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,359
Yeah, you got the crusty old cop,

976
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,839
and then you got the sexy sidekick.

977
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,319
That's right.

978
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:17,119
Maler Fee, man.

979
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,000
I hadn't thought about that.

980
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,960
Well, that's why I'm here.

981
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,880
What's the next question?

982
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,359
Okay.

983
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,000
This is Joe Lipparella from Pennsylvania.

984
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,359
Relativity tells us that as an object approaches a speed of light,

985
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,719
or is in a deep gravitation,

986
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,440
a well-timed slows to a stop relative to other observers.

987
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,880
My question is,

988
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,240
what is on the other side of that extreme?

989
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,960
If an object is motionless,

990
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
and if there is zero gravitational effect on it,

991
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,400
how would time work for that object?

992
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,320
If there's zero gravity,

993
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,720
then time goes fast for it.

994
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,480
Well, an object is motionless,

995
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
and if there's zero gravitational effect on it.

996
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,679
Right. So...

997
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,480
How would time work?

998
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,519
When you are in the presence of gravity, you age slower.

999
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,800
So this is like the ultimate anti-aging hack.

1000
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,199
This is we should bottle this.

1001
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,679
We should be on QVC right now,

1002
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,800
not on this dog and pony show you called Star Talk.

1003
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,480
We can be making some big stuff.

1004
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,679
But start our own QVC channel.

1005
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,239
Yeah.

1006
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,239
Dr. Tyson's QVC hack.

1007
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,519
So what are they asking then?

1008
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,239
They're asking my question is,

1009
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,880
what is on the other side of that extreme?

1010
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,599
In other words,

1011
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,280
Relativity tells us that as an object approaches a speed of light,

1012
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,800
or is in a deep gravitational well, time slows to a stop.

1013
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
Okay. So now watch.

1014
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
So some years ago,

1015
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,720
people realized you couldn't accelerate past the speed of light.

1016
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,920
But does that preclude a particle existing faster than light?

1017
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,120
If you can't accelerate past it,

1018
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,680
can you exist on the other side?

1019
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
And...

1020
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
Sirius thought was given to that,

1021
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
to the point where there's some movies based on it.

1022
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,120
And there's a hypothetical particle that has these properties.

1023
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,240
It's called a tacky on.

1024
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,960
Tackyos from the Greek meaning fast.

1025
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,320
Tackyos.

1026
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Tackyons.

1027
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,680
And tackyons would live backwards in time.

1028
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,440
How is that possible?

1029
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
Because if time slows down as you reach the speed of light,

1030
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,880
on the other side of speed of light,

1031
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,160
if you continue the equations,

1032
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,800
jumping that gap time would go backwards for it.

1033
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,000
Tackyon.

1034
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,560
For it.

1035
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,800
For.

1036
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,519
Yes.

1037
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,320
Yeah.

1038
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,960
For it.

1039
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,240
Do we know they exist?

1040
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,920
No, never found them.

1041
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,480
So then how could you have a theory about something that you'd...

1042
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,440
Because it's allowed to exist by Einstein's equations.

1043
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,639
And if something is allowed,

1044
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,079
that's good enough for you to go out and look for it.

1045
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
If other parts...

1046
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,559
But at one point do you stop looking and all serious and go,

1047
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,680
when this doesn't...

1048
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,280
But if you can't find it...

1049
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
Welcome to the frontier of science.

1050
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
No, it's like I can't find my phone in my house.

1051
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm not going to keep looking.

1052
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,639
Go, I know it's there.

1053
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,599
We don't know.

1054
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,320
That's right.

1055
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,280
It's a mystery.

1056
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,079
But if you give up and someone else finds it a month later...

1057
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,840
So would time meet an object with no gravity and no movement,

1058
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,480
it's like my lazy good for nothing, 15-year-old son,

1059
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,360
and won't move along.

1060
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,720
Right? It just lays, just sits there.

1061
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,120
So the answer to the question is,

1062
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,120
yes, or is it that clear?

1063
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
The answer is...

1064
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,039
Well, wasn't there two parts of that?

1065
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:15,920
Yeah, there's the...

1066
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,519
An object approaches speed of lighters in a deep gravitational well.

1067
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,960
Time slows to a stop.

1068
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,320
Yes, in a deep gravitational well.

1069
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,200
Yes, time slows.

1070
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
Correct.

1071
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,559
And what is on the other side of that extreme?

1072
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,680
And that would be techy on.

1073
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,399
Techy on, which we are known that we haven't found them.

1074
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:30,719
Okay.

1075
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,039
Correct.

1076
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:31,679
Got it.

1077
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,440
The techy on's work in the equations.

1078
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,679
So as a result...

1079
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,119
And so we're saying, well, right,

1080
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,559
all these other ways, maybe this prediction of the equation should work as well.

1081
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,279
Got it.

1082
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:43,599
So if you are motionless in space,

1083
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
for as you're concerned, you still have your own timeline,

1084
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,159
and all that matters is what other people will say of you as they fly by you.

1085
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,960
So everyone will have a different time reference for you.

1086
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,359
But all you care about is your own clock and your own wristwatch and your own clock on the wall.

1087
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,199
And that's all you care about.

1088
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,559
Now, that's if you're not moving,

1089
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,559
but if there's no gravity,

1090
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,519
then time speeds up for you.

1091
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,759
So if an object is motionless and there's zero gravitational effect,

1092
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,319
how would time work for that object?

1093
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,199
This is where we're talking...

1094
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,159
And so this is where we were joking about gravity anti-aging hack, right?

1095
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,199
So in other words,

1096
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,439
there'd be no aging because time...

1097
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,639
There's zero gravitational effect.

1098
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,359
Yeah, but you...

1099
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,799
And everyone else around you,

1100
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,960
in your same reference frame,

1101
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,279
will age at exactly the same rate.

1102
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,480
It could be one second for every ten seconds outside of your club.

1103
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,439
But it won't matter to any of you.

1104
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:46,559
You can't hack that system and say,

1105
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,079
I want to go back to when I was younger.

1106
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,319
Okay, but if you're so smart, tell me who in that group is going to get a plastic surgery first

1107
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,559
to avoid the aging process?

1108
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah, plus if you're in space with zero G,

1109
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,719
some surgeries aren't necessary.

1110
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,559
No, well, you had straight...

1111
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:04,719
Well, because you got nothing pulling on you.

1112
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,840
But nothing pulling on you.

1113
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,480
So the floats.

1114
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,320
That's what we should invent.

1115
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
We should invent people.

1116
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,400
Zero G facial surgery.

1117
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,159
I like this question.

1118
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,799
It's very simple and straightforward, but interesting.

1119
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,440
Dennis Alberti, please explain buoyancy.

1120
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:20,720
buoyancy.

1121
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,159
I love it.

1122
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,360
All right, so it's all about density.

1123
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,519
In the end of the day, it's about density.

1124
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,559
And gravity, you know?

1125
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,840
So if you are...

1126
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,039
And gravity, yes.

1127
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,000
If you are less dense than the medium you're immersed in,

1128
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,360
you will float to the top.

1129
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,639
Is that simple?

1130
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Is not more complicated than that.

1131
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,240
Defined density.

1132
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Dancing.

1133
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,840
It's how much matter you can cram into a certain volume.

1134
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,760
So the big advance,

1135
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,559
it's amazing this didn't happen until the 19th century.

1136
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
Was there was some early variants in the 18th century,

1137
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,720
but it really took off in the 19th century.

1138
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,360
The fact that you could float metal.

1139
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,760
If you make a boat out of metal,

1140
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
then it's almost impervious to war.

1141
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,000
Not icebergs.

1142
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,240
And a billion dollar gross at the movies.

1143
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,639
It's exactly what Titanic did.

1144
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,039
But probably up to two or three billion now.

1145
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,480
Look, to summarize it, a submarine is a boat in denial.

1146
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,159
So here's what happens.

1147
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:20,960
So...

1148
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,000
You should react to that.

1149
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
That was a good line.

1150
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,119
So...

1151
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
A submarine is a boat in denial.

1152
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
So if you have a hull that's made of metal,

1153
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,400
any bits of that metal would just sink to the bottom.

1154
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,599
However, if it's in the hull shape,

1155
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
it's pressing down on the water.

1156
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
The water is rising up.

1157
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,320
And you've created an environment that on average is less dense than water,

1158
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
and so therefore it floats.

1159
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,960
Because of the V shape.

1160
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,639
Because most of the volume is air.

1161
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
So you get to add the air plus the metal

1162
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
as part of the contents that's within the volume.

1163
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:57,840
And when you do that,

1164
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,480
we systematically reduce the density of the material.

1165
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,800
If you go back a thousand years ago,

1166
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,639
people made boats out of wood,

1167
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,119
sensibly because wood floats.

1168
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,079
So you would make anything out of wood, it would float.

1169
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,920
That made complete sense, but you were susceptible to attack.

1170
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,800
But if I took a metal plank, a four by 12 piece of metal, flat,

1171
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,559
and threw it in the water,

1172
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,320
would that sink?

1173
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,559
Yes.

1174
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,119
Because you don't have that V shape,

1175
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,159
you don't have the relation to air.

1176
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,360
Because it's all about volume.

1177
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,119
It's all about volume.

1178
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,360
So if you carve it into a volume,

1179
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,360
then it's the mass of the shell divided by the full volume of the whole thing.

1180
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,440
And that gets very low to be lower than water.

1181
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,400
It'll just float.

1182
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,360
It's the same principle why an iceberg can float.

1183
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,159
Because you've...

1184
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,000
Icebergs are just simply less dense than water.

1185
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,000
Simply less dense.

1186
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,440
So you don't need that V shape for that to...

1187
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,400
For an iceberg? No.

1188
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,360
No.

1189
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,639
I mean, you don't ever need a V shape, except that...

1190
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,519
I mean, like Styrofoam will make the boat,

1191
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,720
but it doesn't need a V shape.

1192
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,720
V shapes are important if you know the material you're working with is heavier than

1193
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
than the stuff itself.

1194
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,039
Because you're displayed, you want to display.

1195
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,159
Right.

1196
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,440
It's all about displacement.

1197
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,840
Correct.

1198
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,840
So the bottom line is

1199
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,159
icebergs float.

1200
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,200
You got a V shape hull steel float.

1201
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,440
Yes.

1202
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,679
Styrofoam cooler.

1203
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,880
Best scenario.

1204
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,240
You can sit on it and tap in and get a couple of beers at the same time.

1205
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,880
At the same time.

1206
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,760
Okay, that's why I'm here.

1207
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,000
Paul, I'm tapping one more.

1208
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,480
One more.

1209
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,880
He got it.

1210
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Okay, this is actually very interesting.

1211
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
One, Terry Burke from St. Louis.

1212
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,079
My question is simple.

1213
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,840
Nuclear fission and fusion, a small amount of matter is lost and converted to a large amount of energy.

1214
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,639
Is the gravity associated with the lost mass also lost?

1215
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,920
No, because, great question, by the way,

1216
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,440
gravity emanates not only from mass, but also from energy.

1217
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,920
Because mass and energy are the same thing.

1218
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,119
Different sides are the same coin.

1219
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,639
So, you're not just losing mass and non-energy.

1220
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,880
You're losing some combination of the two and they go hand in hand.

1221
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,240
So, the answer is no.

1222
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,079
Is the gravity associated with the lost?

1223
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:14,960
No.

1224
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,039
And that can never vary.

1225
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,559
This is a constant.

1226
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,680
This can never, the idea that gravity associated with the lost mass is also lost.

1227
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
Oh, matter and energy are one and the same thing.

1228
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,360
So, they each distort the fabric of space and time.

1229
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,519
And that's all you need to know about it.

1230
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:34,720
Okay.

1231
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,760
We will commonly think of matter,

1232
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,560
distorting space, but if there's energy there, it will distort space as well.

1233
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,600
And equals empty squared reminds us that they're two sides of the same coin.

1234
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,000
The more the amount of energy it's created is the same amount of gravity lost.

1235
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,160
In other words, the mass lost is gravity associated with the lost mass is also lost.

1236
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,280
Do you lose more gravity?

1237
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,960
The more energy that's created?

1238
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,560
If it leaves the system, yes, you're losing gravity anytime,

1239
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,240
any matter and energy leaves the system.

1240
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,280
No, I know, but doesn't it change over time?

1241
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,200
No, you know, depending on the amount of energy that's created,

1242
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,600
the more energy that created, the more gravity is lost.

1243
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,720
No?

1244
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:14,960
Yes.

1245
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,920
But the, it's a lot of energy and a very small amount of mass.

1246
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,200
So, I wouldn't lose sleep over it.

1247
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,320
Well, listen, it's up to me what I lose sleep over.

1248
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,000
Just because you walk through life not caring about science the way I do.

1249
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,640
I can't.

1250
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:35,120
It is weird, though, that humans for one third of a rotation of the earth are semi-comatos.

1251
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,560
One last question.

1252
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,200
I'll do it in somebody.

1253
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,519
One last question.

1254
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:39,840
Quick one.

1255
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,720
Okay, okay.

1256
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:40,800
Okay.

1257
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,080
Uh, uh, uh,

1258
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,040
Mick Markler.

1259
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,080
I used to have a bell here.

1260
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,280
I don't know what I'd do with it.

1261
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,040
I'm Mark from Portland, Oregon.

1262
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,400
So, the system comprises of remnants from a single supernova

1263
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,600
or a collection of many.

1264
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,320
If many, I'm curious how are

1265
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,120
or any galaxy diffuses multiple supernovas together.

1266
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,320
Okay, so first, a supernova is a huge explosion

1267
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,000
and it's gutsy just scattered everywhere.

1268
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,600
Just start with that.

1269
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,319
Then the galaxy rotates as we say,

1270
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,119
differentially.

1271
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,759
So the inner parts complete a circle faster than the outer parts.

1272
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:23,759
This shears the gas clouds that have all been contaminated by the detritus

1273
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:25,119
of a supernova explosion.

1274
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:27,920
And you get a few rotations of the galaxy.

1275
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,360
This stuff becomes very well mixed.

1276
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,639
And the next generation of stars is going to have all the ingredients

1277
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,400
from that last round of supernova explosions.

1278
00:45:36,879 --> 00:45:38,159
It was like fertile ground.

1279
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:38,480
Yes.

1280
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,119
It's the next round.

1281
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:39,759
Yeah.

1282
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:40,319
Got it.

1283
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:40,960
All the way through.

1284
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,199
All right, I think that's all our time.

1285
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:43,920
Good questions.

1286
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,239
Wow.

1287
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:44,960
Yeah, excellent.

1288
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,920
All Patreon members.

1289
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,879
But this is for our general audience.

1290
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:49,759
General audience.

1291
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:51,519
The week, by the way, if you join Patreon,

1292
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,000
we do special custom Q&A sessions just for you.

1293
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,119
And that's on the other side of the Patreon paywall.

1294
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,400
Yeah, and it's worth paying because we dress up as a Lidavithan characters

1295
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,599
when we do that.

1296
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,319
That's the cutest.

1297
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,199
So but yet that's what you're missing because you're too cheap to join.

1298
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:09,679
All right.

1299
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,400
Good for you.

1300
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,279
Oh, and we give out gold bars to everybody.

1301
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,519
That's when I put the sword and that sword, you see, I gotta use that sword.

1302
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:17,679
Right.

1303
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,839
And every Patreon member gets a puppy.

1304
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:22,319
An opponent.

1305
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:25,759
All right, we're done here.

1306
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,799
Yet another installment of cosmic queries with Paul McEureo.

1307
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
Paul, I'll find you your show on the road.

1308
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,160
Yeah, PaulMicuryo.com.

1309
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,080
Did someone say take that show on the road?

1310
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,280
And that's what you did.

1311
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,080
I did it in New York and then the authorities called and said,

1312
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,039
inside out with Paul McEureo and my podcast.

1313
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,560
Is there a movie called Inside Out?

1314
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,320
There is, but thanks for bringing that up.

1315
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,360
This is how you help me get people come.

1316
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,800
Oh, yeah, you just copied something.

1317
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,600
So don't go see it.

1318
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,440
Yeah, inside out.

1319
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,120
It has a good interactions with the audience.

1320
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,960
You're very good on your feet in that way.

1321
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah, my show permission to speak is about sort of engaging the audience

1322
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,360
in their stories.

1323
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,199
It was born out of crowd work at the audience.

1324
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:05,760
Yeah, good.

1325
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,360
Love crowd audiences.

1326
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,679
But it's, but people have had your podcast.

1327
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,440
Inside out with Paul McEureo.

1328
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,079
Which I've been on.

1329
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,240
You've been on in Paul McCartney and Stephen Colbert and a lot of fun people.

1330
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,079
Well, I wasn't enough to

1331
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,599
do you work?

1332
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,760
The only reason Paul McCartney did it is because he found out you did it.

1333
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,360
Oh, I think that's what I was.

1334
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,680
And, uh, and he knows a lot more about the theory of relativity than you do.

1335
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,079
Weird.

1336
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,920
I don't know because I just already played music.

1337
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,320
No.

1338
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,400
Yeah, so hopefully people can check all that stuff out.

1339
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,960
Paul McCurriot.

1340
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,559
Yeah, but for it, you got it.

1341
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,559
All right, this has been start talk.

1342
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,960
Cosmacqueries, grab bag edition.

1343
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,079
Neil the Grass Tyson here.

1344
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,280
Thanking Paul McCurriot.

1345
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,200
As always, I bid you to keep looking up.
