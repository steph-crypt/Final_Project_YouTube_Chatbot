1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
We discovered expanding universe. If we're expanding, it is vast in every metric we've ever established for it.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:16,500
There are things that are vast in size, in temperature, in speed.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,300
Just to get a feel for that, take a tree and expand it to be the size of the observable universe.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,000
Then the Planck scale would expand roughly to the size of an atom.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
So the Planck scale is to an atom as a tree is to the universe.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:41,500
This very quickly leads you to have even greater existential dread because if you run the movie backwards, it gets to a point which seems quite catastrophic where these galaxies are literally on top of each other.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,000
And eventually you're kind of imagining something that's so dense that you have to start thinking about as hot, soupy and chaotic.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,500
The reason why you can't put quantum mechanics into it, it already seems to have quantum mechanics embedded in a deep and subtle way that Einstein himself didn't recognize.

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh, please, to tell him, because my edible just kicked in and this is fascinating.

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
You can't put something into something into there.

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,500
We just don't know where it is inside of that thing, but once we find it in there, we're going to be like,

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Oh, that's where it is! And we're like, I told you not to put it in there, it was already in there!

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
That simple, it's elegant, it's profound, it's amazing.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I agree.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:46,500
So maybe it's not the photon being pulled, maybe the space itself is being warped and the photon is like surfing on the space.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
So it's just like, yeah man, this wave is awesome!

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
And so you see it curve, right? But in that's the case.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Why can't it escape a black hole?

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Because, you know, does that mean that the space inside of a black hole is being folded in, even the photons can't get pulled out?

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Yeah, essentially.

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
What's happening?

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Who's that happening?

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Parkly.

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
But I want to be more than this.

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
He said, would you, can't be more than this, I said, why not?

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
He said it, because I'm more...

27
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
That's a stupid kind of thing.

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
There we go guys singing really, really low voice.

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
That's a proflindo.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
That's a proflindo.

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
It's like you can almost see the vocal chords right now.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Love, we're going over here.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Oh my god, that's pretty good.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh, that's a good vibe.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Love, we're going over here.

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Love, we're going over here.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Nice job.

38
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Love, love.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Love.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Hi, Juna.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Number one.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Oh, the crowd is ready for it.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I got you.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
No, I don't do the band.

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I sit on it.

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I just make a map like this.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
So this is where in 1920, we didn't know if there were other galaxies.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
A lot?

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Yeah, I mean...

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
We thought we were the main character.

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
The Milky Way was the universe.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
The manual comp, even in the 1700, imagined that some of these fuzzy things were island universes.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I can't hear his name without me.

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
So stop it.

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Stop saying it.

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Stop, you crazy.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
But island universes?

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I think so.

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
You think so?

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I have fun, I'm in Leapass.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I was wondering if I could make it.

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Can we have a V-Hack?

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
We're going to see the every...

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Maybe I can come to Leapass.

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Please.

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay.

69
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
We're going to see the last three games.

70
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
We're going to see the last three games.

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
The whole band is going to be a little bit more fast.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Okay.

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
What do you see?

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah, I just wanted to know.

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I want to double check it now.

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
He's getting a little, he's getting a knuckle.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
There.

78
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
So you're pretty fast.

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Let me say...

80
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
He was like, he was like, yeah, he was like, this is a...?

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Oh, that's a tough one.

82
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Oh man, that's right.

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Okay.

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Oh man!

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh man!

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh man!

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Okay.

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh man!

89
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh man!

90
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Okay.

91
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh man!

92
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh man!

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Oh man!

94
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Oh man!

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
That was nice.

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
That was nice.

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
What do you got?

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
So before we begin, I just wanted...

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I didn't know this until today that the two of you are actually current collaborators on some research.

100
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Could you just highlight what that is?

101
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
What are you doing?

102
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I mean, Brian and I have been working together for years.

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah.

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Mostly, we've been thinking about extra spatial dimensions.

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,500
And different cosmological implications, implications for theoretical physics.

106
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
You know, hiding some dark energy and some extra dimensions.

107
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
As one does.

108
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
As one does, yes.

109
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
You're thinking about higher dimensions.

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Yes.

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Because the three plus time dimensions are not enough for you.

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Well, you know, even Einstein, when he started working, wondered why three.

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I mean, it's a curious question.

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Once you start...

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Well, it's a magic number.

116
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Yeah.

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
It's a good or favorite number.

118
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Thank you.

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
You're favorite number?

120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Wait, those are schoolhouse rock people right now.

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
They count to three.

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
They got it right away.

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Okay, but how many dimensions are there, really?

124
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,500
We don't know, but certain theories tell us that it could be much more than the ones that meet the eye.

125
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
So it could be as many as ten or eleven.

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh, like gender.

127
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:52,500
I said it, and now I'm getting arrested.

128
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Did you just make up other dimensions?

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I mean, it sounds like you're pulling it out of your ass.

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Yeah, it's all over.

132
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
You didn't deny that immediately.

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
That was a great practice.

134
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay.

135
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Partly it is.

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
But it was also deep mathematical reasons that lead us to these ideas.

137
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,500
And we figure if nature can try some experiments, she will.

138
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
So every possibility might actually happen.

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Okay.

140
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
So we're just exploring.

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
All right.

142
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
How about me?

143
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Do you guys smoke?

144
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
All right.

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
So.

146
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Please, I'll let you.

147
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,500
The microscope and telescope were invented 400 years ago.

148
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,500
And like I said, they take us to the grandest visions of our understanding of our place in the universe.

149
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,500
And the tiniest visions that also give us an understanding of our place in the universe.

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,500
And so this, those first steps were magnified at the dawn of the 20th century, especially through the 1920s.

151
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,500
And so let's start out with the large and we'll end with the small.

152
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Okay.

153
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
So let's go back to the roaring 20s.

154
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Let's just do that.

155
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:22,500
And here's something that it's hard to even believe that just 105 years ago, we didn't know if there were other galaxies.

156
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,500
We just thought all the stars in the night sky, the Milky Way was the entire universe.

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
We weren't given reason to think anything.

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, if there were these fuzzy things in the sky, okay, they're just fuzz.

159
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
We call them nebulae, which is Latin for fuzz.

160
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Yes, thank you.

161
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
So we just thought it was just space-lint.

162
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
And but some fuzz, lint, face.

164
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm not your message.

165
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Nebulae, some nebulae were spiral shaped and others were irregular.

166
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:08,500
And the irregular ones were found in the plane of the galaxy, whereas the spiral ones were in every direction you looked.

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Interesting.

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
So that was, oh, it was a first thing.

169
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Well, maybe we can unpack this and figure out what's going on.

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:30,500
So there was a famous debate took place in 1920 at the national, hosted by the National Academy of Sciences, between Hebert D. Curtis.

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes.

172
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Unfortunately, that name.

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
And Harlow Shapley soon to become the director of the Harvard College Observatory.

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
And Hebert Curtis was director of the Allegheny Observatory.

175
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Two very different...

176
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Yeah, I'm going to say one of those sounds more expensive.

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
All right.

178
00:08:49,500 --> 00:09:01,500
So they debated whether the spiral things were other galaxies, with a term coined by Immonual Kant in the 1700s,

179
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
who thought about this, philosopher.

180
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Yes, Chuck?

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
No, Brian!

182
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Brian did it to me, man.

183
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
What a Brian do to you.

184
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Because he knows I can't hear the name Immonual Kant without being 12 years old.

185
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Okay.

186
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm so sorry.

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Okay.

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,500
So he's a philosopher, deep thinking philosopher, who looked up and he saw these spiral objects.

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
And he thought of them as possible island universes.

190
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh, that's pretty cool.

191
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
And island universe.

192
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
That's beautiful.

193
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Yeah.

194
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
That is.

195
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,500
But we didn't have evidence to say that, to support it, but it was a deep idea at the time.

196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
So there they are, they debated this.

197
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
And...

198
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
But based on what evidence just hot taken?

199
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
They're scientists.

200
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Okay.

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
All right.

202
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Which means...

203
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Sometimes we have rose colored glasses towards the past.

204
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Yes, I get it.

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
So here's how it works.

206
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Two scientists argue, there's a pact implicitly signed before they even begin.

207
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Which is either you're right and she's wrong, you're right and he's wrong, or you're both wrong.

208
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
They know this going into the conversation.

209
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
It's nerd thunder dog.

210
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
So two scientists enter.

211
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Two scientists leave.

212
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
But one's a little embarrassed.

213
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Pay per view Saturday night.

214
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Yeah.

215
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
So here's...

216
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,500
This is their Tyson Jake Paul, real kind of throw down.

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
So let's go to the Harvard fellow.

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Yeah.

219
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Because you can always tell a Harvard man, but you can't tell him much.

220
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Oh, I got it.

221
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
So they were insufferable back then as well.

222
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Got it.

223
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Or they also like, I went to school in Boston.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I'd lost my fucking...

225
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Fuck you.

226
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Just say it.

227
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Just say it.

228
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
So...

229
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Say it.

230
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
You know?

231
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I don't know.

232
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
All right.

233
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
So back to the...

234
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Here's what happened.

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Let's march.

236
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Shappley was heavily invested in the entire night sky being part of the whole universe and the Milky Way.

237
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:32,500
And he had evidence at the time from a fellow astronomer who had looked at the spiral nebulae and claimed that he found them having moved on the sky.

238
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Now, if you're really, really far away, that's essentially impossible to measure.

239
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,500
But if you're close up and you're moving, you can see that movement.

240
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Okay?

241
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Things that are close to you.

242
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:53,500
The example here is, if I see a plane moving across the sky and then I see a bird moving at the same angle, I don't conclude that the bird is going...

243
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes, it's passing out.

244
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
...and the bird is much closer.

245
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
So at much lower speeds, I can see it across my field of view.

246
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,500
So because it's closer, that evidence suggested that the spiral nebulae were nearby.

247
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
And he... he bet on that horse.

248
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
But it was the wrong horse.

249
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Oh, for sure.

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,500
He was doing what a good scientist will do. He took the data, put his confidence in the data.

251
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It was later shown that the data he was basing his argument on was false.

252
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
It could not be verified by the work of other scientists.

253
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,500
In fact, no. The spiral nebulae had no motion across the sky.

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
And so, Shapley was just wrong.

255
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Later, we would later show that he's wrong.

256
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,500
And what puts the nail in the coffin?

257
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
1923.

258
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Edwin Hubble.

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Oh, the man.

260
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Hubble was a person before he was a telescope.

261
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Yeah.

262
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I thought he was born a telescope.

263
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Born a telescope?

264
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I just like when you're a kid, you're like, of course.

265
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
There was ninja turtles, and they were birthed.

266
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Yeah, there it is.

267
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,500
So, he had an idea based on evidence, and it turned out to be wrong because the evidence was flawed.

268
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
So, there's some lessons there.

269
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Right?

270
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,500
And if one scientist has one bit of evidence, you don't alert the authorities yet,

271
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,500
until there's confirming other experiments to do so.

272
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
That is what the peer review was all about.

273
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
That's peer review.

274
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And by the way, for anybody who wants to know, scientists are haters.

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Okay.

276
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
That is what they do.

277
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You come up with something, and somebody goes, I call bullshit, and then it's on.

278
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's just on.

279
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,500
So, Neil, a peer review to us non-scientists is basically, it's scientific group chat,

280
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
and for you present your takeer information, and the 17 other friends that are in the group chat

281
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
get to be like, what's the bullshit?

282
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
And Sampley had a green bubble in the chat.

283
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Oh, god damn.

284
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
God damn, what a horrible life to live.

285
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
He was the one green.

286
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
He was the one green.

287
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Surrounded by blues.

288
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, and if you have an idea, and it's shown to be wrong, then it's just wrong.

289
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,500
In fact, Einstein, after his relativity, which we'll get into in a couple of minutes,

290
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
that was hard to accept by people, right?

291
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
It was hard.

292
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
It was very counterintuitive.

293
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Someone came up with a work saying 100 against Einstein.

294
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
100 against Einstein.

295
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
And then he's rumored to say what after that?

296
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Let's say I just learned this anecdote, but he's rumored to have said,

297
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,500
why 100 if I'm wrong, one would have been enough.

298
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Wow.

299
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah.

300
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's pretty great.

301
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Yeah.

302
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
And believe me, I've been married for 27 years.

303
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
That is right.

304
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Okay, so here's what happened.

305
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
So Edwin Hubble is curious about the spiral nebulae.

306
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,500
And he finds a star in them that matches a kind of star that's not in a nebulae.

307
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
It's just sort of nearer by than that star.

308
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,500
And it's a very specific kind of variable star, named after the very first of its kind,

309
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Cepheid variable.

310
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
The first of its kind was found in the constellation Cepheus.

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,500
And so that's how we categorize types of variable stars.

312
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,500
The first one in a constellation, all the others, no matter where you find them, are that variety.

313
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Found a Cepheid variable there.

314
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
And what was spent, tell us what's special about the Cepheid variables.

315
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Well, they have a very predictable property where their luminosity, how bright they shine,

316
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
is related to a sort of oscillation.

317
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
And so you can tell that you're looking at precisely one of those.

318
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
It's very easily identifiable.

319
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
If you get the luminosity out of it, then you can say I can see the period vary.

320
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Right.

321
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Based on that period, I know how bright it should be.

322
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
How bright it should be.

323
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
So it says, though, you knew your light bulb, right?

324
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,500
You can tell if you have a very bright light bulb far away or a very dim light bulb up close.

325
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Of course. Right.

326
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
How can you distinguish the two?

327
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
And how do you distinguish the two if you know nothing about the light bulb?

328
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
But if you know everything about your light bulb, you know exactly what it is, then you can say,

329
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
oh, I know this light bulb, so I know exactly how far away.

330
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
So he says this star is of this particular luminosity.

331
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,500
And the only way it can be that dim is if it is far out of it.

332
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
You know, everything happens in space.

333
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
And space is happening in space time.

334
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,500
In the four dimensions of space time, there can never be a time without a place and vice versa.

335
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,500
If I say meet me, you will need to know where and what time to make that happen.

336
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Regardless of the place throughout the entire universe.

337
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Well, how would you like to give the gift of space time?

338
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Suppose I told you you could mark any occasion with a beautiful physical representation of its corresponding space time.

339
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Well, thanks to our friends at Under Lucky Stars.

340
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
You can do just that.

341
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Under Lucky Stars makes beautifully designed star maps that show the unique alignment of the stars in a place and date chosen by you.

342
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Whether it's a birthday and engagement wedding or when you first met, the stars never look the same twice.

343
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Each star map can be personalized with your unique title and footnote.

344
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Now, I have three children.

345
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I gave each one of them a birthday star map.

346
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Each one has the same message.

347
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
This is the sky under which Morgan entered the universe.

348
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
This is the sky under which Aiden entered the universe.

349
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
And this is the sky under which Charlie entered the universe.

350
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
And they love it.

351
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:10,500
And so will your mother, brother, sister, father, wife, child, best friend, or even your boss, you know, if you're that kind of employee.

352
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Because you're giving them the most unique commemoration of a significant life event that they will always cherish.

353
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
So don't wait.

354
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
You can even go super meta and give them a star map of the day.

355
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You gave them a star map.

356
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,500
All right, okay, maybe I'm prone to being a little extreme, but perhaps you'll just start with an important date.

357
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Go to underluckystars.com and immortalize the happiest moments of your life.

358
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
That's underluckystars.com.

359
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
And now, back to the space time that is the show.

360
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:56,500
It's important to know what he actually meant by that because Hubble himself never was convinced that these were actually other galaxies.

361
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,500
He proved that there was something beyond the outskirts of our galaxy.

362
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
We know our galaxy about 100,000 light years across.

363
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
His analysis showed this to be 900,000 light years.

364
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
We now updated it to 2 million light years.

365
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,500
But Hubble was so conservative that he was unwilling to then say this is an island universe.

366
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Is this a galaxy in a stone right?

367
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
What is it, idiot?

368
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,500
What's the difference just from a space real estate standpoint?

369
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
What's the difference between an island universe and a galaxy?

370
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
What are we talking about?

371
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
They're poetically identical.

372
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
The same.

373
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
They're the same.

374
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Pohedically identical.

375
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Got it.

376
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Yeah.

377
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Because if our galaxy is our universe and is another galaxy, then you get to call that a universe.

378
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Except once we see the full breadth of it all, we got to reallocate how we use the word universe.

379
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Because it's universe.

380
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
One.

381
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
One.

382
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
One verse.

383
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Right.

384
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,500
But we're in the multi-versus.

385
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Spider-Man.

386
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
We're in the.

387
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
We'll get to that.

388
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Okay.

389
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
We'll get to that.

391
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
All right.

392
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Minus the spider-man.

393
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
But we'll.

394
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
You didn't like the second one.

395
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I thought it was great.

396
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:22,500
So, so, Janet, how did we reeling from the fact that we are not the universe.

397
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
We're just a part of a universe.

398
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:34,500
And then a few years later, Hubble discovers that the spiral nebulae are in motion, body and soul.

399
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
So, what's going on there?

400
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah.

401
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:45,500
So, once he's starting to be able to use these cephyde variables in these standard candles to get a strong sense of how far away things are, he can start to do that.

402
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,500
He can start to do that kind of mapping out the local environment, what we have right nearby.

403
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
And then also galaxies further away.

404
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
These little smudges on the sky.

405
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:03,500
And he begins to catalog not only that there are other galaxies around us, that create distances, but there also seem to be receding away from us.

406
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Largely, predominantly.

407
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Yeah.

408
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
So, he makes a plot.

409
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Makes a plot.

410
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
So, this is very strange.

411
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I mean, you're looking at all of these enormous galaxies.

412
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
So, a galaxy's a collection of hundreds of billions of stars.

413
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
And they're pretty localized.

414
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
And maybe they're spirals and blobs.

415
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
And they're very far away.

416
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
And they're also moving away from us in every direction.

417
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
That's a peculiar.

418
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
So, he makes this plot.

419
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
It's completely freaky.

420
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
But it gets freaky because the further away they are, the faster they're expanding away from us.

421
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
And they're calculating this all without computers.

422
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Well.

423
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Hundreds of billions of stars.

424
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
People were called computers back then.

425
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Sure.

426
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
So, yeah, they should.

427
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Yeah.

428
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
So, yeah.

429
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
They should.

430
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Yeah.

431
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Look at the work computer.

432
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
A person who I have to use.

433
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
A person who I have to use.

434
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
A person who I have to use.

435
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah.

436
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
So.

437
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Well, wait.

438
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
And there's a room full of.

439
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
And yes, but they're doing it without the machines.

440
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
The lecture list.

441
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,500
So, he actually uses the work of one of the Harvard computers, which was a woman named Henrietta Levitt.

442
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
And she was part of a group of women who worked at the Harvard Observatory that were called...

443
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
And she would talk like this.

444
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Of course.

445
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Of course.

446
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Well, they were called Pickering's Herm because Charles Pickering, at one point, was so frustrated with his male computers.

447
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
That he fired them all and he said, my maid could do a better job and he hired his maid.

448
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Who was Willemina Fleming and she did a great job.

449
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
And she hired all these other women and one of them was Henrietta Levitt.

450
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
And she made 30 cents an hour.

451
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Can I hand that in?

452
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Can I give you a hand?

453
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Can I give you a hand?

454
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Are we applauding her or her pay?

455
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
That was weird.

456
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
30 cents an hour.

457
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
She should be making iPhone.

458
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Okay.

459
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
So.

460
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I said it.

461
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I said.

462
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
That's up.

463
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
So, but mixed in here, we've got simultaneous things going on.

464
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Einstein's general theory of relativity is already at the races.

465
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Okay.

466
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
So that came in in 1915.

467
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
15.

468
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Okay.

469
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,500
That gave us a mechanism to understand what the whole universe could be doing that just catches up on that.

470
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Well, Einstein writes down his equations in 1915.

471
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:24,500
And initially he applies them to things like the motion of the Earth around the Sun and terrestrial and nearby motion.

472
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Okay.

473
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Local things.

474
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:36,500
But then some other very creative thinkers, one in particular was a Belgian priest named George Lomatra.

475
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:44,500
He decides to apply the mathematics not to something in the universe, but to the entirety of the universe.

476
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
And find from the equations that the universe should be expanding over time.

477
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
It should be slowly.

478
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
But it should be clear.

479
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
He was able to do that not based on his training as a priest.

480
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
He was a priest physicist.

481
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:10,500
He was a priest physicist, but no doubt his interest in applying these ideas to the entirety of the universe was not distinct from his focus on the big questions of existence.

482
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
That they weren't that separate, although he in his own mind was very clear.

483
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
He said there are two ways to have deep insight about the world.

484
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500
There's mathematics and there's salvation.

485
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
And he said, let me follow both.

486
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
And that's what he did.

487
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
But not intermingled.

488
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
He was very clear not to it.

489
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
There was a line in the sand.

490
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Absolutely.

491
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Yeah.

492
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
So, so, so, lemmatra.

493
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I'll let you guys figure out the pronunciation.

494
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
So, he takes the equations.

495
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,500
We have an expanding universe, but he, so lemacher.

496
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Before, before, the mantra predicts an expanding universe using Einstein's equations.

497
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
So Einstein could have made the prediction and he didn't.

498
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Yeah, in fact, in 1917 Einstein actually got there first.

499
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,500
And when he applied the equations to the entire space, was very disturbed.

500
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,500
That he couldn't get a universe that met his own philosophical prejudice.

501
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Which was?

502
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
That the universe is fixed, eternal, static, and unchanged.

503
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Why would anybody think the universe could be anything other than that?

504
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Well, I mean, there is this book called Genesis, which seems to suggest a beginning.

505
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Okay.

506
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
So there are some people who think perhaps that that vision is not correct.

507
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,500
But Einstein and many others at the time very firmly believed that the universe could not change on the largest of scales.

508
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
And that's just a philosophical bias.

509
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Totally.

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
And in fact, he changes.

511
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Wait, wait, wait, how could he get away with that?

512
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,500
If all the galaxies have gravity, and if they all feel each other's gravity, they would all collapse down into one point.

513
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Yeah, so this was an argument that Isaac Newton actually gave,

514
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,500
actually gave, hundreds of years earlier, but if the universe is infinitely big,

515
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,500
and if the galaxies are spread across the infinity of space, then there is no center for them to collapse toward.

516
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Yeah.

517
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
So you can envision a static universe now.

518
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
If it's infinite.

519
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
If it's infinite.

520
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
And only if it's infinite.

521
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:12,500
But even more than that, Einstein then, in his own general relativity, recognized basically the issue that you're raising in a finite universe.

522
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:20,500
And he said, let me introduce a repulsive push to counter the attractive pull of gravity.

523
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And that's an anti-gravity force field called the cosmological constant.

524
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
So he introduces this into the map in 1917.

525
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
It was not in the 1915 equations.

526
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,500
He introduces it just to have a static universe that will allow him to breathe easy.

527
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
And to fulfill his philosophical bias.

528
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Then the mantra says, we can have an expanding universe.

529
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
And so how did Einstein react to that?

530
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Einstein learns of this from the matra in 1927.

531
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,500
And he says to the matra, your calculations are correct, but your physics is abominable.

532
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Oh, it ends fighting words.

533
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
It's right.

534
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,500
By which it was saying, you can't trust that every mathematical calculation tells you something real about reality.

535
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,500
And some math should be in math textbooks, and it's interesting, but it's nothing more than a mathematical curiosity.

536
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
And he says, let me try your idea of an expanding universe.

537
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
That's a mathematical curiosity. It's not real.

538
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Okay, so then 1929, Hubble discovers an expanding universe.

539
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Now what? What happens next?

540
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Well, so it's interesting because the way I originally described it as kind of confusing, you might think it makes it seem like we're at the center of this expansion and everything's receding away from us.

541
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,500
But the way the Hubble law is specifically, it's much more like the space between every galaxy is actually stretching.

542
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,500
So from their point of view, if you were on one of those other galaxies, it would also look like anything you're receiving away from.

543
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Right. Everything's receding away from it.

544
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:58,500
And if you imagine that it's not the galaxies literally moving on space time, but actually the distance between the galaxies that's stretching, then something further ways actually moving away from you faster.

545
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,500
There was more space stretching, and this was really closer to the matrix description, not even closer.

546
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
It simply wasn't static.

547
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,500
So just so I'm clear, at that time they believed there's only one galaxy, and approximately 1925, just so I'm following.

548
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I feel like I'm in a chrysanolin right now watching tenet. Let me just pause real quick.

549
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
No, not at all at the time.

550
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
2324, one galaxy.

551
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,500
One galaxy, it was one, it was one, it was one universe, one universe copy.

552
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Yes.

553
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
How many universes are we in now?

554
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,500
But are you talking island universes or are you talking universe universe?

555
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm talking about the whole thing.

556
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Oh good god, there's one universe that we know about.

557
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Built with 100 billion galaxies, each of which has on the order of 100 billion stars, there are theoretical ideas that Niel suggests we might get to tomorrow.

558
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
That speak to the possibility there might be other universes.

559
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,500
So the answer is we don't know for sure, but the data seems to suggest that there's one universe.

560
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Well we were talking about this backstage, if the delta is that big between those two numbers, which is one, and this is just basically the set of Gagilian.

561
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:19,500
How do we know that what we're living in right now, the data that we know right now isn't going to be wildly off in 50 years from now or 100 years from now, they'll be like look at those dumbdums in 2020.

562
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
We hope that that's what will happen.

563
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
We live to be wrong.

564
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
We live to be wrong.

565
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
We're scientists.

566
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Oh god.

567
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
We live to be wrong.

568
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Got it.

569
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Okay.

570
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
So let's follow through this reasoning.

571
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
We discovered expanding universe.

572
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,500
If we're expanding, that means we're bigger today than we were yesterday.

573
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
And bigger yesterday than we were the day before.

574
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
So logically, where does that take us?

575
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Bigger.

576
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

577
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
So yes.

578
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:08,500
If you're already disturbed about the lack of permanence to the universe, then this very quickly leads you to have even greater existential dread because if you run the movie backwards,

579
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
then everything was once closer together.

580
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,500
And if you keep running the movie backwards, it gets to a point which seems quite catastrophic where these galaxies are literally on top of each other.

581
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:31,500
And eventually, you're kind of imagining something that's so dense that you have to start thinking about as hot and soupy and chaotic and then what?

582
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
What a lemon for Polish.

583
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Yes.

584
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:50,500
So the major basically said, look, if the math is saying that the universe is expanding today, and if then Hubble's data shows that the universe is expanding today, just whine the cosmic film in reverse, you run the film backwards and things get closer and closer together.

585
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:58,500
And there are suggestions that there's a point in the distant past when everything was on top of everything else, and he calls us the primeval atom.

586
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
This is the beginning, according to his description.

587
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:12,500
How can I happen to know if there was an astronomer active at the time, brilliant guy named Fred Hoyl, who was not into a universe that would be changing.

588
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
He knew the universe was expanding, he couldn't reason that away.

589
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Accepted that.

590
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Yeah, accepted that.

591
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:31,500
But if you're expanding, but you're always the same, that must mean matter is being spontaneously created in the void to create new galaxies so that statistically, the universe always looks the same.

592
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:39,500
But here's the thing, if the universe is expanding that in itself is a change, so why would you not accept a changing universe?

593
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Because he wanted to always look the same for all of time, for all eternity in the past and in the future.

594
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Again, it's a philosophical bias.

595
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,500
But I think the idea of the beginning was particularly disturbing.

596
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
The idea, so this primedial atom that lamatures.

597
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
It's disturbing the scientists, but not for religious people where God made the universe.

598
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
They're perfectly happy with the beginning.

599
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Pope Pius XII, perhaps the nerdiest pope in history who loves science.

600
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Why do you know this?

601
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
He didn't, I don't know.

602
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,500
He took the lamatures work and he said, there is the scientific evidence for Genesis.

603
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
That's what he said.

604
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
And when Lamature heard this, he threw a fit.

605
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Belgian priest, Lamature.

606
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
That's right.

607
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
That's right.

608
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Not directly, but yes, when he catches wind that this is what the pope is saying.

609
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,500
And one of his students who was in the class, the lamature had to teach that afternoon after learning.

610
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
He said that the major who normally was very quiet, mild-mannered.

611
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:44,500
He came in and ranted for 45 minutes because his whole point was, I am not blending my religious life and my scientific life.

612
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,500
And here the pope is taking my scientific work and he's turning into religion.

613
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,500
But notice, he said all that to a student and not the pope.

614
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,500
You don't want to know the Galileo situation.

615
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,500
So I have a tamer version of that quote.

616
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:12,500
As far as I see, such a theory of the primeval atom remains entirely outside any metaphysical or religious question.

617
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Yeah, that's after I had a couple drinks and children.

618
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Okay, so then I got called the Big Bang by Fred Hoyle.

619
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Yeah, so Fred Hoyle was in a 1948 BBC radio interview.

620
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Why do you even know this level?

621
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I don't care about that.

622
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Okay.

623
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:38,500
And so he is describing his own approach, which as you mentioned is a steady state approach where matter is created spontaneously and fills in the gaps in space.

624
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,500
And so they ask him about this other approach, not his.

625
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,500
And he says, oh, that theory in which all matter must be created in one Big Bang.

626
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,500
And that's where the idea of Big Bang theory comes from.

627
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Now, people have interpreted that as a derogatory description.

628
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:11,500
His own way of recounting the story is he was simply trying to draw a distinction between a theory in which in his steady state, only a little bit of matter is created here in the air cross space versus this other theory.

629
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Like one hydrogen atom per century per cubic light year.

630
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
There's some small rate.

631
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Not quite that small.

632
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,500
So it is one atom per century per Olympic-sized swimming pool.

633
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Oh, okay. That's all that you need.

634
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
And so it's kind of an amazing.

635
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
In the whole universe.

636
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Because what's more believable that one little atom forms in a swimming pool size arena of space per century or that there's this moment where everything is created all at once.

638
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Framing it that way, his theory sounds perhaps a little bit more believable.

639
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Or less, less crazy.

640
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah.

641
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Yeah. So what do we have to assume if there is a Big Bang?

642
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,500
So we've got to assume that the expansion has been uniform the whole time.

643
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Not necessarily.

644
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
It doesn't have to be uniform.

645
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
No.

646
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Yeah, it can change over time.

647
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Oh, that's been always expanding.

648
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
It's always expanding.

649
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Okay.

650
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
And-

651
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
And lesser's extra dimensions.

652
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
That's my-

653
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Alright.

654
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
So can expand differently in a-

655
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Brian and I are talking about this way.

656
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Well, yeah, you can squeeze the other dimensions.

657
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:18,500
There could have been chaotic mixing of the expansion and contraction, but overall, the overall volume of the universe was expanding.

658
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
But the way you get this is looking at the rate at which the universe is expanding.

659
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Yes.

660
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
And that is a slope on a graph.

661
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
And Hubble first derived that.

662
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
And it's-

663
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
There's a slope.

664
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
And it's just-

665
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
He called it a letter C, which is for constant.

666
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,500
But since then, we swapped that out with a capital H for Hubble.

667
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
And we called it the Hubble constant.

668
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Yeah.

669
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Very famous Hubble constant.

670
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
So it's constant over space.

671
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Yeah, it's important to realize-

672
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
It's not very-

673
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
It's really the Hubble parameter we should call it, because it does change in time.

674
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
It was-

675
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
It could have been faster in the early universe, faster in the future.

676
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Alright, so Hubble, he had the wrong-turned-out-

677
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:05,500
The Sephede variable he used, he didn't know at the time, there were two varieties of Sephede variables.

678
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,500
The one that's near us and the one that you can see from far away.

679
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
And he presumed they were the same, no reason to think otherwise.

680
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Right.

681
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
So he got the wrong distance, the wrong expansion rate of the universe.

682
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
So Sephede is like diabetes, is type 1 and type-

683
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Yes, there's a type 1 and type 2.

684
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Exactly, I think.

685
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Maybe not exactly.

686
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Yes, there's literally type 1, Sephede and type 2, Sephede.

687
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
And you got to use apples and apples when you're doing this exercise.

688
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
So he got an age in the universe of two billion years.

689
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
We would later refine these numbers.

690
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Why and I was in graduate school many moons ago.

691
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,500
The uncertainty in the Hubble concert was a factor of two.

692
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
There was a ten-

693
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
So with the-

694
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,500
With the Hubble concert, you run the film backwards.

695
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Ask how much time at this expansion rate looking backwards, when do we get to time zero?

696
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
That makes sense.

697
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Yeah, just when is everybody in the same place at the same time?

698
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
That's a perfectly sensible question.

699
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:15,500
And we got two number, there are two camps, a ten billion year camp and a 20 billion year camp.

700
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
A whole factor of two.

701
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
And everyone is fighting for their-

702
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,500
And we know they both can't be right.

703
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
And so we need better data.

704
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
One of the goals of-

705
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Wait, isn't being off by ten billion quite a bit?

706
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
That's a lot.

707
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Again, the median and I only took physics one.

708
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Okay.

709
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,500
In undergrad, I did not advance, I don't want the smoke, but I am saying being off by ten billion.

710
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
There's a lot.

711
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Here's a thing.

712
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Like if you go out to dinner and we split it and I'm off.

713
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,500
That big of a delta.

714
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
If I'm, yeah, if I'm a hundred percent off.

715
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Yes.

716
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Yes.

717
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Aren't you like you lose your science little thing?

718
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
No, so.

719
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
You know what I mean?

720
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Like if it's a disbard.

721
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah.

722
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Here's a thing.

723
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
But you know, you just get to talk your shit.

724
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Here's a thing.

725
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
You are off by ten billion.

726
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
You get to talk your shit still.

727
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Here's a thing.

728
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Like my dad in the living room when he's giving his opinions about politics.

729
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,500
He just gets to run his mouth continuously.

730
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I got this.

731
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Go ahead.

732
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
This is me and my dad thing.

733
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,500
But I'm just a little mad that a capital S scientist was this off.

734
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Okay.

735
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Go ahead.

736
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
And that was a second question.

737
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
The universe is vast.

738
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Yes.

739
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
In time.

740
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Yeah.

741
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
And in space.

742
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Sure.

743
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
It is vast.

744
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,500
In every metric we've ever established for it.

745
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
There are things that are vast in size.

746
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
In temperature.

747
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
In speed.

748
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
In gravity.

749
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,500
And so if I'm off by a factor of two.

750
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Between ten billion and twenty billion.

751
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Yeah.

752
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I could have been off by a factor of ten.

753
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
By a factor of a thousand.

754
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
By a factor of a million.

755
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
We were quite happy.

756
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
We were in the same sandbox.

757
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Having that conversation.

758
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,500
So it's kind of like being Jeff Bezos.

759
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
If I'm off by ten billion.

760
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Not so bad.

761
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
So.

762
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
So.

763
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Could I also ask you the second philosophical question which is?

764
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Sure.

765
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Which is.

766
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
No, no, no.

767
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
This is real.

768
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
When you were like, it's either ten billion or twenty billion.

769
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
And I was asking you this backstage which was,

770
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
when the number is that big, is it almost like the United States is a debt?

771
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Where they're like, the deficit is at twenty eight trillion.

772
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
And you're like, what does it even matter now?

773
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Yeah, but it's at a good, Jillian, Manillion.

774
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Like, what does it matter?

775
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Well, why does the number, because I feel like a freshman in college.

776
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
It's going to matter in awful lot.

777
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Stop.

778
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I would say that actually ten billion is actually quite good ten to twenty.

779
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
It's very much in the ballpark because.

780
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
You should run the federal reserve.

781
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
You should run the federal reserve.

782
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
You should run the federal reserve.

783
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah.

784
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
You know what I mean?

785
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
It's a good way to think about it.

786
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
You could have been off by a trillion.

787
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Well, but the future is going to be much, much longer than the past.

788
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
So it's not as though the universe kind of will expire within another ten billion years.

789
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Like we're confined to this number.

790
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
The future could be just a huge number.

791
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
We could be living in a time where it's not ten billion.

792
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
It's a kind of way where we're going to be perhaps, these are all very, very good answers.

793
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Perhaps one other way of looking at it.

794
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
It was a bad question.

795
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,500
We don't care whether it's ten billion or twenty billion.

796
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
The number doesn't matter.

797
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
What does matter is...

798
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
That's the most American answer, by the way.

799
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
That's the most American answer.

800
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,500
The truth is we don't care, but we want our theories to work.

801
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,500
We want our theories to make predictions that match with observations.

802
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,500
That's the only thing that matters to us.

803
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
The actual answer that comes out whether it's ten billion or fifty billion...

804
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Or forty trillion.

805
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Like you're saying it just doesn't matter.

806
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,500
What we need to have a consistent description so that we have evidence that we know what we're doing.

807
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Because evidence is bad.

808
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Both sides could not be right.

809
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,500
And so when the Hubble telescope was launched, okay, I'm just getting out of graduate school.

810
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
It is launched.

811
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,500
The number one goal set for that telescope was to resolve that discrepancy.

812
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,500
The telescope's named after the guy who gave us the Hubble specimen in the first place.

813
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Within two or three years, we nailed it.

814
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,500
And the Hubble constant, its value would give us an age of the universe at about fourteen billion years.

815
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Which is comfortably between those two extremes.

816
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,500
And that's science working at its best.

817
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,500
There's a limit to how much we can keep beating each other over the head.

818
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Let's get more data.

819
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Let's build a telescope that'll solve this.

820
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
And in fact, today there is a similar argument happening.

821
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,500
It's not between 20 billion and 10 billion, which as you say is a factor of two or a hundred percent difference.

822
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Now we're down to the five percent difference.

823
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:16,500
We understand things that well, that we have two groups that are five percent apart, describing a number of years, billions of years into the past.

824
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,500
And that's the precision with which we can do it within five percent.

825
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,500
And they're killing each other.

826
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,500
So again, we don't care the exact number.

827
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,500
We care that we can describe it with that level of precision when we're talking about events that happen billions of years ago.

828
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
That's the mind bending.

829
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
And here's the issue.

830
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,500
When it was 10 and 20 billion, you always have to report your uncertainties for a number in science.

831
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:49,500
And those uncertainties had a little bit of overlap in the middle and it landed where you expected it to land.

832
00:42:49,500 --> 00:43:00,500
And now that we have two other warring factions on the value of the Hubble constant, those two numbers are within five percent of each other, but the uncertainties are tight.

833
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
So the uncertainties don't overlap.

834
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,500
And if you look at go Google search on Hubble tension, and that's what will come up.

835
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Adam Reese is coming to pay new works in October.

836
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
I just planted an ad.

837
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Adam Reese, you know about prize.

838
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,500
One of the Nobel Prize winners who discovered that the universe is not just expanding the expansions getting ever faster.

839
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,500
It's accelerating who is part of this Hubble tension debate.

840
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,500
We'll be speaking at pioneer on the Hubble network.

841
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Without waxing philosophical, I just don't want to miss this point that we're not actually saying, which is what makes science so incredibly great is exactly what you all just demonstrated.

842
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:52,500
It is this pursuit of the truth based upon the best available information at the time.

843
00:43:52,500 --> 00:44:00,500
So it's okay if it's wrong because when it's right, we're going to get there.

844
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Yes.

845
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:08,500
You got it.

846
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:17,500
All right. So we're turning the clock back and we get to the big bang.

847
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:26,500
And but now the universe, large skill universe described by general relativity is now small.

848
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
It is so small you extend the equations go back.

849
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
The universe is the size of an atom.

850
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Does quantum physics apply to the entire universe or only to atoms?

851
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Where are you on that? Both of you.

852
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Well, at this point we feel we have to invoke quantum mechanics to understand what was happening in the big bang.

853
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,500
The energy scales are so dramatic and that we're really probing quantum physics.

854
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,500
High energies, you're really looking so much surprisingly at small scales.

855
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:08,500
So we are still trying to grapple with what the big bang is telling us about the potential to understand not just general relativity but a kind of quantum variant of that.

856
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
If there is such a thing.

857
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Yeah. So I got general relativity and I got quantum physics.

858
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Do they make nice in the sandbox?

859
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:22,500
That's a deep and difficult question and one that I and many others have spent their lives trying to answer.

860
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
And we do not fully let me answer yet.

861
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Let me restate that.

862
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah.

863
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
That you and others have spent your lives failing to answer.

864
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Yes. Okay.

865
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Agreed.

866
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
But I said that by a slightly said that.

867
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Okay.

868
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
I hear that.

869
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Ah, take that.

870
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Okay, you got a fan over here.

871
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Right. So no, it's exactly the case.

872
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:49,500
So when you take Einstein's equations of the general theory of relativity and you try to invoke quantum mechanics within the same calculations,

873
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
which as you eloquently noted, you'd have to do.

874
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:00,500
If you're talking about the whole universe when it's incredibly small, you need Einstein's general theory of relativity to the whole universe after all.

875
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,500
But you also need quantum physics because it is so small and that's the theory that describes the small things.

876
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:15,500
And when you try to simply put the equations together, you get one answer out from almost any calculation, which is infinity.

877
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
And that might sound old. That's interesting.

878
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,500
A big, deep mystical number. No, it's nonsense.

879
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Infinity is nature's way of grabbing us by the lapel and slapping us around and saying you're doing something wrong.

880
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
You've got to figure this out.

881
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
So I put another one. That's what.

882
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Infinity is where God divides by zero.

883
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Yes.

884
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Stephen Hawking.

885
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Yes.

886
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Oh, Stephen Hawking said that.

887
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Well, at least that's for these attributed.

888
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Okay.

889
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Okay.

890
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,500
So, but you say they don't make nice in the sandbox.

891
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Yeah.

892
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
So there's a limit.

893
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
What's this plank length?

894
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
What's going on there?

895
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Well, the plank length is the scale at which.

896
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
It's named after who?

897
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
After Mox Plunk.

898
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I love how you say Mox.

899
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
I don't know.

900
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
What do you think of my time?

901
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
I say Max Plunk.

902
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I know.

903
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Max, okay.

904
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Well, a hundred years ago in the early discoveries of quantum mechanics was thinking about whether the universe was discrete or if it really was a continuum.

905
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:29,500
And if I looked, for instance, at the air in this room, if I look closer and closer, do I find that it's actually made of individual molecules moving around and is not actually continuum and same with water and was thinking about these things.

906
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
So in other words, water is not infinitely divisible.

907
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
You get to molecule at some point.

908
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Eventually you get to an individual quanta, a little particulate, a discrete bundle.

909
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:52,500
And in thinking about this, there was sort of a fundamental scale that we would say is when we can definitely no longer think in a way where we're ignoring this quantum scale.

910
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Where we're forced as Brian is describing beyond that, we're definitely going to strike an infinity.

911
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,500
But by the Plunk, Lunk, we're in trouble.

912
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,500
We really should be trying to understand the theory of gravity at a quantum level.

913
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Maybe that means that space time is coming in little individual bundles.

914
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
I don't even know how to think about that.

915
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm just thinking about correlations between little tiny space time is coming.

916
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Yeah.

917
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
That was a wild sense.

918
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,500
That was very game of thrones.

919
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Space time is coming.

920
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Well, I mean, if it came from the big bang, I mean, was it the moment that space and time was in fact created?

921
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,500
And are we thinking about things of a continuum of space time itself?

922
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Brian, how big is that smallest unit?

923
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
The Plank and I have to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

924
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:48,500
And again, I know the question will be, well, how do you think about something that so that's all what is it?

925
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
What is it?

926
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
10 to the minus 33 or 10 to the minus 31?

927
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,500
And again, don't care about the exact value, but that's where the mathematics takes us.

928
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:03,500
And just to get a feel for that, if you were to take an atom and take a tree.

929
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Take a tree and expand it to be the size of the observable universe.

930
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,500
A tree.

931
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Then the Plank scale that 10 to the minus 33 centimeters would expand roughly to the size of an atom.

932
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,500
So the Plank scale is to an atom as a tree is to the universe.

933
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,500
That's how tiny the distance we're talking about here.

934
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
And why?

935
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
I'm going to channel.

936
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,500
And so you mentioned this with a ruler?

937
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
I know.

938
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm going to channel.

939
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Can I channel you right now?

940
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
You can channel me.

941
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,500
I'm not going to even pretend like I understand what's happening right now.

942
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
Maybe 100% honest.

943
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,500
There's like 3,500 people here and I'm like, don't act like you know.

944
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
No.

945
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
I'm going to channel.

946
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
You lost me at space time is coming.

947
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,500
And by the way, you came in quite hot, Brian.

948
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
And you're like, I know what you're thinking.

949
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
And that's not what I was thinking.

950
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
I was thinking.

951
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
I think it's really incredible.

952
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Let's just have a quick little tangent here.

953
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
I think it's really incredible.

954
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
It is almost 9 p.m.

955
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,500
And this many people went on ticketmaster.com.

956
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
And you're like, paid fees.

957
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
You way back there.

958
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Up there.

959
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Yes.

960
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Way up there.

961
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Yeah.

962
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,500
You guys paid tickets to learn about space and epilite.

963
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
It was very heartening.

964
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
So that's what I was thinking about, Brian.

965
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Actually, like, you know when people say this country is going to shit.

966
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
And math and science is at an all time low.

967
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,500
I'm like, you know what?

968
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
It's the math and science lovers.

969
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I feel the real thing in theater.

970
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
On a...

971
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,500
You know.

972
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Of all things you can be doing at 9 p.m.

973
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Just...

974
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
So, so I'm channeling...

975
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
How's that on here?

976
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Sure.

977
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
What?

978
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Why do you have any confidence at all that you know what's happening on a scale that's small?

979
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
We don't.

980
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Oh, okay, that's it.

981
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
That's it.

982
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Come on, come on.

983
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
Come on, come on.

984
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Thank you guys.

985
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
We don't know anything.

986
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
We have to be off by a whole lot.

987
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
Good night.

988
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Take care.

989
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Thank you, begin.

990
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
No, no.

991
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,500
So, so let me see if I can unpack this.

992
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Yeah.

993
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Is it true we're going to figure it out right now?

994
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Yeah.

995
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Okay.

996
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Sure.

997
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Is it true that every prediction we've ever made with quantum physics when we've been able to test it has come true?

998
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Absolutely.

999
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Okay.

1000
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Well, that's true.

1001
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,500
That's right.

1002
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:27,500
General relativity, we already know what its boundaries are because there are calculations you cannot make because of this infinity problem.

1003
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
Absolutely.

1004
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Therefore, if one of those is going to succumb to the other, it sounds like Einstein has to...

1005
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,500
He's going to have to bow down to the quantum.

1006
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
That's what's happening.

1007
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
Bend the knee to the quantum.

1008
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Bend the knee to the quantum.

1009
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:49,500
So either quantum will absorb Einstein or there's a higher level understanding that'll absorb them both.

1010
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Yeah.

1011
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
That's true.

1012
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
But also quantum isn't in competition.

1013
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:01,500
We have theories of matter, for instance nuclear forces that we understand, they can be quantized.

1014
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Theory of electromagnetism can be quantized.

1015
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:13,500
So there are laws of physics and quantum mechanics is a regime in which we're understanding the highest energy attributes of those laws of physics.

1016
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:21,500
Now, gravity, Einstein's general relativity, is replaced the theory of gravity with this theory of space time, this theory of geometry.

1017
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
The place Newton's theory of gravity.

1018
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:33,500
But it is one of those forces that should sit with the matter forces and have a classical regime, meaning a regime which we don't worry about quantum mechanics, things look smooth.

1019
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,500
We understand general relativity works beautifully.

1020
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Regime sounds very political.

1021
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Very good.

1022
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,500
It does.

1023
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
It does.

1024
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Tate.

1025
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Totally does.

1026
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Tate.

1027
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Very U.S.S.R.

1028
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,500
It sounds very...

1029
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Unfortunately, she was in light.

1030
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Everywhere.

1031
00:52:49,500 --> 00:53:01,500
But then when we go to the early universe, like the Big Bang or in the course of black holes, where things start to get very extreme, we want to be able to quantize that law of physics.

1032
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
As we have quantized other things.

1033
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
It's not going to replace gravity.

1034
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
Exactly.

1035
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
It's not going to replace gravity.

1036
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
We want to quantize gravity.

1037
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
And that seemed like a perfectly reasonable request.

1038
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,500
So Einstein's equations are not quantized.

1039
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
They require continuum.

1040
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
So how do you quantize gravity?

1041
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Good.

1042
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,500
So, Jan is describing the history as very insightful and useful.

1043
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,500
So, we had an equation for electricity and magnetism that came from Maxwell.

1044
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,500
We were able to blend that with quantum mechanics, giving us quantum electrodynamics.

1045
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
It works.

1046
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,500
We had equations describing the strong and weak nuclear forces.

1047
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,500
We were able to embed quantum mechanics into those theories, works wonderfully well.

1048
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:52,500
When we try to play exactly the same game with Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, and try to put quantum mechanics in there to quantize it, it just doesn't work.

1049
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
So, what does that mean?

1050
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Well, it means you're not smart enough to...

1051
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Well, it's an interesting.

1052
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
It could be that we're not smart enough.

1053
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,500
And I'm full well willing to take that as the ultimate answer.

1054
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,500
But there's a lot of evidence if you allow me to come right up till today for just a moment.

1055
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,500
I know you want to go to the end.

1056
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,500
This is the Centennial.

1057
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
But go ahead.

1058
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:25,500
There is evidence today that Einstein's general relativity, the reason why you can't quantize it, the reason why you can't put quantum mechanics into it, it already seems to have quantum mechanics embedded in a deep and subtle way that Einstein himself didn't recognize.

1059
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Oh, please, to tell him, because my edible just kicked in, and this is fascinating.

1060
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:40,500
I mean, what you're saying right now is revolutionary, because what you're saying is you can't put something into something in there.

1061
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,500
If it's already there, we just don't know where it is inside of that thing.

1062
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,500
But once we find it in there, we're going to be like, yo, that's where it is.

1063
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,500
And we're like, I told you not to put it in there, it was already in there.

1064
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Okay, check the...

1065
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Amazing!

1066
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Check the blue and gasket, we got it.

1067
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,500
No, that is like, that's simple, it's elegant, it's profound, it's amazing.

1068
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
I agree.

1069
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:12,500
Alright, so let's back up, back to the Roaring Twenties.

1070
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:25,500
And I just want to go down the list of completely freaky things that quantum physics prescribed that defied anybody's common sense, and which is why it's still freaky.

1071
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,500
In fact, what's that quote from, was it Feynman about quantum physics, what did he say?

1072
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:37,500
Yeah, there are a few, but if you think about quantum mechanics without getting dizzy, you haven't understood a single thing about it.

1073
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Oh, and I understand it very well.

1074
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Okay, so, 1923, the Wave Particle Duality is proposed.

1075
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,500
So, that's kind of freaky.

1076
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Yeah.

1077
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
That particles are also waves.

1078
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Yeah, it was Prince Louis DeBroy.

1079
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Who, basically...

1080
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
He was a prince?

1081
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Yeah, and so he said, look, in 1905 Einstein showed us that light, which we had thought of as a wave, actually needs to be described as a particle.

1082
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
So called photoelectric effect, now we wait till...

1083
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,500
1905.

1084
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
1905.

1085
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,500
And then in 1923, in his PhD thesis, Louis DeBroy says, let me do the reverse.

1086
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Electrons, we always think about them as particles, maybe they need to be thought of as waves.

1087
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
And that is a key moment in...

1088
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Wasn't his PhD thesis like, that was a prince who did that?

1089
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
A prince.

1090
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
A prince?

1091
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,500
I don't believe it.

1092
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,500
I know current monarchy, not that intelligent.

1093
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,500
That's me honest.

1094
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Harry or William, you're not cooking.

1095
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
You're not cooking this up.

1096
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
There's too much incest.

1097
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,500
You know this, you understand science, for you to be operating at that level.

1098
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
So not buying it.

1099
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Nope.

1100
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,500
You cheated off someone's paper, not buying it.

1101
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,500
So his PhD thesis, if I remember correctly, was like 12 pages long or something.

1102
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Very short.

1103
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Very short.

1104
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
And he got a Nobel Prize for that.

1105
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,500
He got a Nobel Prize.

1106
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,500
He got a Nobel Prize for a 12 page.

1107
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
PhD.

1108
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
The PhD paper.

1109
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Yeah.

1110
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Okay, let me just say, that's the smartest dude ever.

1111
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Well, that's how you know he was royalty.

1112
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,500
He turned into a 12 page.

1113
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,500
12 page.

1114
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
He made me cook it.

1115
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Like, Dr. Prince.

1116
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
And he thought, thank you.

1117
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Double space, 12 page.

1118
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,500
PhD paper.

1119
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
No, no.

1120
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
The tighter margin.

1121
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
You entitled me to shit.

1122
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
A couple of years later.

1123
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,500
No, so, Neil, you just, I'm sorry, Neil.

1124
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,500
I shouldn't have spoken ill of the monarchs there.

1125
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
No, no, this, I got nothing.

1126
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,500
This is a market.

1127
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,500
We just want to war to get away from the monarch.

1128
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
That's for long.

1129
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Stop, stop.

1130
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Stop.

1131
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
Stop.

1132
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Stop.

1133
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Stop.

1134
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Stop.

1135
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Stop.

1136
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Stop.

1137
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Stop.

1138
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Just give it time.

1139
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Fine.

1140
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Okay.

1141
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,500
So.

1142
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,500
So then, Schrodinger came around.

1143
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Oh, we have a Schrodinger fan of him.

1144
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
That was the cat.

1145
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Yeah.

1146
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
That was the cat.

1147
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
That was the cat.

1148
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
That was the cat.

1149
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,500
That was the cat.

1150
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
The cat.

1151
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,500
So, what did Schrodinger do for us?

1152
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:24,500
Well, Schrodinger begins to think more abstractly about what's real and what's not real.

1153
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
So, we're used to thinking of particles.

1154
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
You've already described De Broglie and the electron.

1155
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,500
We think of these little fundamental particles, almost like billiard balls, acting out their lives.

1156
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
And they have some concrete existence.

1157
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,500
Schrodinger starts to say, well, there's wave particle duality that's pretty profound.

1158
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:53,500
But maybe the only thing that's real is this thing called the wave function, which is the probability for the particle to be in a certain state, to be in a certain location, to be moving with a certain speed.

1159
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,500
But the particle itself, in some sense, isn't real anymore.

1160
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,500
If you look for it, sometimes you'll find it in a concrete location.

1161
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:09,500
But what is really determined by equations, by the laws of physics, is the wave function, which is this probabilistic description.

1162
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,500
And the wave function occupies physical space, doesn't it?

1163
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Yeah, the wave function occupies physical space and tell you.

1164
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,500
Only for a single particle.

1165
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
So, it's a kind of important subtletay.

1166
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,500
Yeah.

1167
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,500
For one particle, you can think about this wave function as filling space.

1168
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,500
If there are two particles, it lives in six dimensional space.

1169
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
If there are three particles, it's in nine dimensional space.

1170
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,500
So, you really can't think of it in these ordinary terms.

1171
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Oh, I am, huh?

1172
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Well, okay.

1173
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:46,500
So, if the particle can be anywhere here, and I have some barrier here, it could show up on the other side of the barrier.

1174
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Right, but it doesn't actually travel through.

1175
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
So, let's say your barrier is a concrete wall.

1176
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:58,500
If there's some small probability that you would find the particle, the wave function would describe the probability of finding the particle in this region.

1177
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,500
But it doesn't actually like a billiard ball travel through this map wall.

1178
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,500
Okay, but this might be the THC talking.

1179
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:12,500
But the way you guys are talking, there just might just be one particle.

1180
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Like, there aren't bunch of particles.

1181
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
It's just one particle.

1182
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,500
I told you he blew a gasket.

1183
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Well, but Richard Feynman had the idea that maybe there was one particle that circled around through time.

1184
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:35,500
And cycled back over and over again, giving what appeared to be many particles now, but there's only a single particle through this temporal cycle.

1185
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
So, you're right.

1186
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
That's the target.

1187
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Moving forward and backwards through time.

1188
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Oh, my God.

1189
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Okay.

1190
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
All right.

1191
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:50,500
So, but what I'm saying is if a particle can show up on the other side of the barrier, then that you guys came up with a word for that.

1192
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
And it's tunneling quantum time.

1193
01:00:52,500 --> 01:01:03,500
It's a quantum tunnel through the barrier, but that's the point of the short answer saying, what's real is just this probabilistic likelihood of finding the particle.

1194
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,500
The particle itself in some sense does not have concrete existence anymore.

1195
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Okay.

1196
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,500
So, it challenges the whole nature of reality.

1197
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:18,500
No, but, but concretely, there is a probability that we could calculate for the likelihood of you tunneling through the stage and being underneath the floor.

1198
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
And it's a non-zero probability.

1199
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
It's kind of small.

1200
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,500
So, it's unlikely to happen, but that's what quantum mechanics tells us.

1201
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
But the smaller I get, the more likely it will happen.

1202
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Exactly.

1203
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
It can happen in the laboratory.

1204
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
Yeah. Okay.

1205
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
So, just for context here.

1206
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
Wow.

1207
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,500
We were trying to understand how the sun made energy.

1208
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
And we did the calculation.

1209
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:45,500
Once we determined the sun is mostly hydrogen and it's hottest in the center, we said it must be undergoing fusion.

1210
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:55,500
And so, what you run the mass to undergo fusion of proton, the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, has to merge with another proton, the nucleus of another hydrogen atom.

1211
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Protons have the same charge.

1212
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Electrostatically, light charges repel.

1213
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:11,500
So, they have to be moving fast enough so that before they have a chance to repel, they stick together and form a new nucleus.

1214
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Okay.

1215
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:18,500
We calculated what temperature that was necessary, because high temperatures give you higher speed.

1216
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:26,500
We calculated that temperature and was 100 million degrees, and there was no way the center of the sun was going to give us 100 million degrees.

1217
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Because you can calculate through sensible laws of thermodynamics what that should be, and we were scratching our heads.

1218
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:40,500
And the quantum physics comes around, and then you invent this spooky magical thing called tunneling.

1219
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:49,500
And we discover in our calculations that at a mere 10 million degrees, see these, this matters, 10 million, 100 million degrees.

1220
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:58,500
At a mere 10 million degrees, they would otherwise not hit, but some of them tunnel through and connect.

1221
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Tunneling makes the sun's energy production even possible.

1222
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
And I was like,

1223
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:15,500
because it's not just something that particle physicists worry about in their laboratory, I have to worry about it as an astrophysicist.

1224
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Why are you worried about this? It's okay.

1225
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
Thank you.

1226
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
The sun's going to sun.

1227
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Hellrovens, let them, let the sun do that.

1228
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
It's okay.

1229
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,500
Okay, Neil, don't blow up that.

1230
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,500
Okay, so tunneling.

1231
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,500
A lot of things.

1232
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
There's a lot tunneling, and.

1233
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,500
So what about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?

1234
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,500
That seems like the biggest thing of them all. Talked me through that real fast.

1235
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:50,500
Yeah, I was saying so. That's the real moment when the old ways of looking at the world are shown they have to be jettisoned.

1236
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,500
Because the old way of looking at the world, what is reality?

1237
01:03:53,500 --> 01:04:00,480
Rality is stuff that's at a location moving with a certain speed. That's the way we describe the world and

1238
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:06,519
Heisenberg with the armature of quantum mechanics says you can't actually do that

1239
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:09,500
You can't specify the location and the speed

1240
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:14,599
Simultaneously of any object you can't do it according to the quantum equations

1241
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:17,780
So the very language of reality that we used to use

1242
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,139
No, they're applies. Why can't you measure both at the same time?

1243
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:26,019
Well if you have a particle described as a wave, right?

1244
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:31,699
And you want that particle to have a definite location that wave has to be highly

1245
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:37,879
Spiked so that you can say ah almost a hundred percent likelihood it's at this location

1246
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,900
But when you see how the notion of velocity comes into quantum mechanics

1247
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:48,739
It has to do with the wave length of the wave and so if you want something to have a definite speed

1248
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:55,699
It has to have a definite wavelength. That's not spiky. So to have definite location needs spiked have definite speed

1249
01:04:55,699 --> 01:05:00,419
You need wave those are different shapes and you can't have them at the same time and have the same time

1250
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:04,479
Can I try analogy nowhere near as precise is what Brian just said

1251
01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:08,019
But sometimes I like this musical analogy if you play a chord

1252
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:12,219
Which is a whole bunch of notes together you can play chords

1253
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:17,339
But you can't simultaneously be playing a single note so the chord is like a superposition of the notes

1254
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,860
And how this relates is that when you're in a precise

1255
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:27,539
Location what Brian's describing is a sharp spike you're sort of in a superposition of velocities or momenta

1256
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:32,579
So it's like it's like the the location is the note the

1257
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:38,760
Velocities are the chords or vice versa. I know the velocity exactly and I'm playing chords. I'm no longer

1258
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:44,680
Playing individual. I'm playing I can't isolate a single individual note in a superposition of notes

1259
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:52,199
So what is so how does all this connect to the what they call the observer effect where you I want to measure the particle right there

1260
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:56,440
I got a look at it so I shine light on it and the light sends it somewhere else

1261
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,839
Yeah, so I can't actually ever know what the particle is doing right and so there's two things in there

1262
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,719
One is as you're saying to look is to interact and

1263
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:12,359
When you interact say by bouncing a photon off a particle you affect the particle because I need the photon to take the picture

1264
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,360
That's right. So that's one key point that emerges from these ideas

1265
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,000
But the other so we can never know anything no no

1266
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,280
That's the crazy thing y'all went on this

1267
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:32,039
Just not right

1268
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:38,360
Quantum mechanics tells us that the things that you thought you could know are not the things that you can know

1269
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:45,840
But with quantum mechanics we made predictions of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to 14 decimal places

1270
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:53,960
It's the theoretical calculation and we measured it and it agrees decimal by decimal by decimal on all of those numbers

1271
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,920
And that's why we love these numbers. They show us that we understand what we're doing

1272
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:09,280
Okay, Brian so you can know without knowing is what you're saying

1273
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,000
We can let me say this Brian the type of energy you're bringing

1274
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,760
You are built for CNN this type of panel smoke

1275
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,280
Fantastic yeah, all right, so this is so be in one of those street fighter squares

1276
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:32,840
The decimal to the decimal to the yeah, it's great. This is great. This is good stuff. This is good television

1277
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,000
so so go ahead now

1278
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,160
So this this observe effect bring us home with certain has been widely

1279
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,320
Miss

1280
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:50,480
Applied by people thinking my consciousness is affecting yeah, look there is a big mystery at the heart of quantum mechanics

1281
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:57,079
Even with our capacity to make calculations that agree with observations to the level of precision that I just emphasize

1282
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:02,920
Perhaps with unnecessary theatricality there is there is a question that we don't know how to answer

1283
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:10,800
Which is what you're asking when you observe you seem to be able to coax one result one answer even though the quantum

1284
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:16,340
Description embodies many possibilities we don't understand how that happens is this the many world type of

1285
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,699
It's it's one answer

1286
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:25,619
But the Schrodinger equation is so beautiful and it does not actually include in it a way to understand how measurements are made

1287
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:31,460
Yes, that's the key point and and so if you really take the Schrodinger equation very seriously

1288
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:36,500
It simply says there are all of these possibilities and they're all have we don't have a theory of measurement

1289
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:41,220
To get us through we still we are in the physics just you know

1290
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,579
There are proposals people have put down mathematical equations that do answer this question

1291
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:54,300
What is the many world type offices and many world's hypothesis is if you have a description of a quantum system like a particle and the quantum wave says

1292
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:02,420
30% chance here 20% chance here 50% chance over here when you measure it you don't get only one result

1293
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,739
There's one of you that finds it over here

1294
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:09,460
There's another one of you that finds it over here and there's a third one of you that finds it over here

1295
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,260
But these are all in different universes. Oh, it's 40

1296
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:22,260
So you just invented multiple universes to explain something you can't otherwise explain the math invented it

1297
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,979
Thank you, Jack. Wait, wait, wait, that's really important

1298
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,899
So this guy named Hugh Everett 1957 in Princeton

1299
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:33,460
He studies the math the very equation that Janimade reference to the Schrodinger equation

1300
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:38,340
He says to himself let me take the math completely seriously and see where it takes me

1301
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:45,380
And the math takes you when you look at the paper it's direct to this possibility of there being multiple universe

1302
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:52,819
It's not made up it really emerges directly from an analysis of the equations and the equations make predictions that are confirmed

1303
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:57,060
So you say maybe I should take this math fully seriously and that's where it takes you

1304
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:05,460
So the passion with which Brian is describing this is like me explaining why I have glitter on my face when I come home

1305
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:07,859
Because I was at an arts and crafts fair

1306
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:09,859
Yeah

1307
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,420
All right, we're gonna have to land this plane

1308
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:25,299
So just briefly yeah, I know you spent your career doing this but just in 30 seconds explain strength theory

1309
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,940
My god

1310
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:36,739
20 seconds life have meaning go I only need 10. Oh look the old picture

1311
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:44,180
Was at the fundamental constituents of matter were little dot-like particles the string ideas that maybe they're little extended

1312
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,500
Filaments and why do we introduce this idea when you introduce this idea

1313
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,140
Quantum mechanics and general relativity do play well in the sandbox

1314
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,860
So

1315
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:02,100
Okay, and that was less than 30 seconds. Whoa. All right. Okay. So what's what's in the future?

1316
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,020
So I know astrophysically we don't know anything about dark matter

1317
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:11,460
We don't think about dark energy. We shouldn't even name them because we don't know enough about them to even name them

1318
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,100
And they should be called invisible I should did you call it?

1319
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
You should be called Fred and Wilma

1320
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,740
No bias

1321
01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:26,899
So or or faster in the light time travel time travel fast and light travel before the big bang is what you're working on or your peeps

1322
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:32,340
Does it address any of this will quantum mechanics take us to all the places we need?

1323
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:37,859
Yeah, I mean to zero evidence that quantum mechanics has any cracks whatsoever

1324
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:40,819
It's the only theory that we've written down in the most successful

1325
01:11:41,219 --> 01:11:46,659
Successful theory and so we give you confidence to believe crazy stuff that it predicts exactly

1326
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:53,619
And so we're pressing on and ultimately we think putting general relativity and quantum mechanics either because they're already born together

1327
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:57,939
Or because they're blended together will be the key to answering these questions

1328
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,739
We're not there yet, but that's exactly where we're headed and why do you need these extra dimensions?

1329
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:06,899
Well, Brian was describing a string theory which may or may not be true

1330
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:13,059
But string theory actually requires extra dimensions for it to make sense for the mathematics to allow gravity and

1331
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:20,020
Matter and quantum mechanics to play nice together, but even without string theory the idea that their extra spatial dimensions

1332
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:24,020
Is just kind of a natural extension when you start to think about space and time

1333
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,060
And you start to take seriously Einstein's ideas

1334
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:32,980
So now we're we're in the predicament where maybe those extra dimensions are harboring the dark energy

1335
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:37,620
Maybe there's some explanation for the dark matter having to do with the extra dimensions

1336
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:42,180
So now we can start to think of the extra dimensions as a dark sector

1337
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:47,619
That are harboring really the resolution like we're observing them already

1338
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:51,860
We just don't have the direct connection to be certain

1339
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,420
So they're visible in plain sight

1340
01:12:55,619 --> 01:13:00,980
Yeah, I mean literally visible, but maybe dark energy is a consequence of quantum energies

1341
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,700
Which is what paper Brian and I wrote many years ago

1342
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,980
Dark energy dark energy which is driving the universe to expand ever faster

1343
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,500
Which is something we observe

1344
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,300
It is also driving my administration

1345
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:17,779
I got a land this plane

1346
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:20,659
I'll go on going

1347
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:25,060
Well, just that we might be observing through something like dark energy

1348
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:29,220
indirect evidence of extra dimensions we can't literally see into them

1349
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:33,699
We can't point to them we can't move around in them yet, but we are living with the consequences

1350
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:38,180
So these could be manifestations of these higher order phenomenon in the universe

1351
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,060
Which is part of the motivation for thinking about them

1352
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,860
Perfect sense

1353
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,500
Thank you Chuck

1354
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
I just wanted to put a button on that

1355
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:54,180
Well from Einstein in his denial of quantum physics in spite of him contributing so mightily to the field

1356
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:59,300
He you described the probabilistic nature especially from Shoridenger's equation

1357
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,340
And Einstein said God does not play dice with the universe

1358
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,340
And Niels Bohr retorted Einstein stop telling God what to do

1359
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,380
You know you don't know if God needs to make some money real quick

1360
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,740
You don't know that with the dice. Yeah, you know you got to see him down

1361
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,460
Poppinies a new universe

1362
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:27,140
I like how back in the day scientists threw shade at each other very poetically

1363
01:14:28,659 --> 01:14:33,619
The way they you know kind of shit posted was very the use of what we have good vocabulary

1364
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:37,140
Yeah, great vivid language. They still do it the same today

1365
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:44,020
Who I'm going to land this plane is offer you a cosmic perspective something

1366
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:51,220
That I'm prone to do when we are exposed to this much information when I think of the 1920s

1367
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,619
Uh

1368
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:58,100
As a scientist it may be the most consequential decade ever

1369
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,539
In the history of science

1370
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,420
based on how it influenced our thought

1371
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:10,739
Our the trajectory of our research that would follow and

1372
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:14,420
But I want to make a slightly different point

1373
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:18,659
Before the 1920s

1374
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:24,739
What are scientists doing well doing sciencey things right

1375
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:28,420
In a lab there's a chemical or there's a

1376
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,579
Partic there's a material or a lymire flask

1377
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:37,460
Yeah, yeah, flask. Thank you. Yes, you flesh out the picture of your lab. Okay

1378
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,260
um

1379
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,859
Suppose it was the 1920s and you had a friend relative

1380
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:51,220
Or you were a politician and you heard that someone is working on the structure of

1381
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
Adams and molecules

1382
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:57,059
You'll say why does that matter to anyone?

1383
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:00,500
I'm a carpenter. I just care that my wood atoms cut

1384
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,859
Or that they can be shined or polished or painted

1385
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:07,699
Why does that matter to me? I'm making cars and an assembly line

1386
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,420
Why why does it matter to anybody?

1387
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:19,220
You're taking your brilliant intellect and applying it to something that nobody cares about except your

1388
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:21,859
cadre of people

1389
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,739
But they will tell you well, it's the foundations of matter

1390
01:16:26,899 --> 01:16:30,659
And they'll tell you I don't care you're using up

1391
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:34,500
National resources to do this

1392
01:16:36,819 --> 01:16:38,500
Well

1393
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:44,099
What has happened every time we research the frontier of science

1394
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:48,819
In basically every frontier of science

1395
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:55,539
Whatever it looks like when you're doing it. It's easy to say that. I'll never apply to anything. I don't why are you doing that?

1396
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,859
You wait a little while their clever engineers

1397
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:02,500
clever other scientists

1398
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,019
They see problems in the world and they see a possible solution

1399
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,340
Do you realize today

1400
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:15,859
There is no creation storage and retrieval

1401
01:17:17,619 --> 01:17:21,539
of digital information without an exploitation of the quantum

1402
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:30,979
The IT revolution that is responsible for nearly half the GDP of the world at some level

1403
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:39,699
Was birth in that decade at a time when people are just exploring the edge of our understanding of the world

1404
01:17:40,659 --> 01:17:48,100
Yeah, it would take 50 years longer than what is typical for an R&D project to show up as a household product

1405
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:57,620
But all I can tell you is if you know anyone who says we're doing too much science or this science is not relevant to me

1406
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:01,060
Well, I don't know why you're doing this that doesn't sound like it makes sense

1407
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,660
What you're doing is you're cutting out at the kneecaps the legs of a future

1408
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:14,579
Waves of discovery that could transform civilization not only take us to where we might want to go

1409
01:18:14,659 --> 01:18:19,220
But possibly solve problems that we it might have created for ourselves

1410
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,100
So

1411
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:35,140
There is nothing more shortsighted in this world than anybody running up and say we should do less science

1412
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:38,819
Because every one of us in this room has been touched by it

1413
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:41,619
And

1414
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:49,539
And there's no greater demonstration of that than the science that unfolded in that decade the 1920s

1415
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:57,219
That's the quantum side of it in the astrophysics side that births our understanding of the beginning of the universe and how the sun makes its energy

1416
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:01,699
We would then learn how the stars manufacture elements in their core

1417
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:05,460
We would learn take a few more decades

1418
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:10,260
Exploiting the quantum applying to other realms of science

1419
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,300
We would learn

1420
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,619
That the very ingredients of our bodies

1421
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:23,060
The carbon the oxygen the nitrogen the iron are traceable

1422
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:31,619
To stars that underwent thermonuclear fusion following all the rules of quantum physics and those stars exploded

1423
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,260
Scattered that enrichment across the galaxy

1424
01:19:35,779 --> 01:19:43,140
Creating the environment the chemical ingredients to make star systems with planets and on some of those planets life

1425
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,220
So that that era

1426
01:19:47,859 --> 01:19:54,980
Not only gave us our IT revolution it gave us an awareness of ourselves that borders on the spiritual

1427
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,340
And it's the fact that not only are we alive in this universe

1428
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:04,100
Because of our ingredients are traceable to stars

1429
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,460
The universe is alive within us

1430
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,780
And that is a cosmic perspective

1431
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,740
This

1432
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,740
This has been dark talk

1433
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,780
Live from the Beakman Theater

1434
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:41,539
This is like a fifth time at the Beakman Theater

1435
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:48,340
Fifth or sixth time and you guys have been a marvelous audience for us. We love you all. I and

1436
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:51,539
Oh

1437
01:20:53,380 --> 01:21:00,579
And I but more than loving you all we love the support you give for science because there is no future

1438
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,420
Of civilization without it we might as well just move back to the cave

1439
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:06,899
So as always

1440
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:10,739
Neil the grass Tyson here thanking our panel. I we got Chuck nice

1441
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:14,979
Brian green

1442
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:17,699
Channel 11

1443
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:20,899
Hasan Minach

1444
01:21:24,019 --> 01:21:26,019
Neil the grass Tyson

1445
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:29,059
You're a personal astrophysicist as always bidding you to

1446
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,300
Keep little eight of you knew this

1447
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,100
You can do it one more time come on

1448
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:41,779
All right here we go. What's the tagline? Let me just

1449
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:48,500
Now the other grass Tyson your personal astrophysicist bidding you to keep looking up keep looking up

1450
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:53,059
Here we go remember it's he's gonna go you know grass hasn't done that and remember those eight people they cared

1451
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,180
You guys all paid money

1452
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:04,740
currency a real number that we know Brian know exactly how much you paid to those sharks at ticket master them now

1453
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,180
He's gonna go Neil the grass has to keep and you go look in up here we go

1454
01:22:11,619 --> 01:22:18,900
Neil the grass Tyson your personal astrophysicist bidding you all to keep looking up all right

1455
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,820
You
