1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
If somebody's telling you something and they say you've got autoimmune disease or heart disease or cancer or you're feeling depressed,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,099
maybe you need more of this thing that costs $100.

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,900
Is this the same as the dude that sells elixir and tonic from the back of the wagon?

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,900
This naked oil sales.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,500
What about fluoride in the water?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,500
These types of broader public health initiatives, if you take them away, it's not going to harm everyone equally, assuming there is a benefit.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,500
During COVID, we really saw a bit of a disaster around our social contract that people leaned into what they would call freedom,

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
but it's really a version of selfishness.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm sorry to say it's a tough word.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Okay, so there's been a failure on the civics front.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
And an individual front, do you remember that there's a thing called the social contract?

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
So anecdotes being presented in place of evidence is an immediate red flag.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
And there's a saying, the plural of anecdotes is not data.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Nice. I need that on a t-shirt.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,500
This is Star Talk, special edition.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
And when it's special edition, you know we've got Gary Arreilly, Gary.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Hi, Neil.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Chuck Knight, how you doing, man?

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Hey, what's happening, guys?

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Can't do a show without you.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Oh man, that's very nice.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Hope that we see you sometimes.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I was going to say, I was about to say, it's very nice even though that's not true.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,500
So today, we're talking about medical misinformation.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
I don't believe you.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
They started early.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Medical misinformation.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Gary, take me into this.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Where do we get?

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
All right. Well, we live in a data driven world and we actually always have.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Haven't we?

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Better information makes for better decisions.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
So why would you want to purposefully create disinformation?

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
We are talking about spreading medical disinformation that can threaten people's lives potentially.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
How can we tell the difference between facts and fiction?

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
What does the actual science say?

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
It's expert time.

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Yeah, and for that, we went to a tick tocker slash YouTuber who is on the front line where this battle is taking place.

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Plus, Neil, we're going to sit you down with an academy-nominated filmmaker responsible for the vaccine documentary, a shot in the arm.

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
And that would be Scott Hamilton Kennedy.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Coming up in this very.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Yes.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Podcast. Yes.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:28,500
So I have in my office here at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City who flew in from Boston for this interview, Dr. Knock.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Dr. Knock.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Thanks for the invitation.

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Dude, this is a clean cut guy as you've ever seen.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I have to tell you, you were the widest dude after all.

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
You can see me dance.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I appreciate it, though.

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I really do.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,500
You have a PhD, you're an academic medical professional, we can call it that.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
That's right.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
And pharmacology?

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Yeah, just pharmaceutical sciences.

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Pharmaceutical sciences.

57
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Drug development, the immunology of drugs.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh, cool, man.

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay. And these are drugs invented by lab scientists to achieve some effect in our physiology.

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
And that is your expertise.

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes.

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Yes, excellent.

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
And you're definitely a social media influencer.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
And here's a word I just learned today.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
You got a med fluencer?

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
A med fluencer?

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
For better or for worse?

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Med fluencer.

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I got like a medical influencer.

70
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
A med fluencer.

71
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.

72
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I got to.

73
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I was, no, listen, I was trying to get clearer.

74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
The word sucks.

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
No, well, no, I will get used to it.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
That's right.

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I have my words, you get used to them.

79
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:39,860
And so you've taken it upon yourself to try to correct the internet with all of its misguided

80
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,900
ways regarding medical doses, medical choices.

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,500
Perhaps a misguided mission, but yeah, that's the goal.

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
That's not a great mission.

83
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I mean, you know, the internet is a cesspool of misinformation and disinformation.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
And what makes you think you could, I mean, you say, let me take on the whole internet.

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Right.

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I mean, the system.

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Are you the guy that in that meme where he's like brushing back waves with a, with the, with

89
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
a push through?

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
You ever see that?

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
The guy with the push through.

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
He's on the beads trying to brush back the ocean.

93
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Yeah.

94
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
That's what it feels like.

95
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Yeah.

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Yeah.

97
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
So you've been on the internet for now, seven, six or seven years.

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
When did the internet become such a safe place for misinformation?

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
It's a good question.

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,699
So I think there's been the transition obviously from print to radio to television to now social

101
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:33,699
media.

102
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,819
I think it was that last gap, which is really democratized.

103
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,019
Anybody can sit down in their car and make a piece of content.

104
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,500
Could you, you can't sit on your car and make a TV show.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
No.

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Right.

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
So there's these editorial layers.

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Filters there.

109
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah.

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Right.

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,259
Which, you know, is a bad thing because not everybody could get their thoughts out there.

112
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,060
But now, of course, the downside is that everyone can do the same for positive information

113
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
and false information.

114
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
Right.

115
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,180
So the, so the tightest way to say what you just said was it was a problem that not everyone

116
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,180
could get their information out when it was limited to TV.

117
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,180
And now everyone gets information out.

118
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,180
And get their information out.

119
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah.

121
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,180
And so there's been this big shift.

122
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,579
And of course, it's now entertainment, the medical information on TikTok and Instagram.

123
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,379
You're competing with people who are dancing and cats and dogs and everything.

124
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,100
And so you may be presenting this very nuanced argument about something, but you're constrained.

125
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,820
You have to make it entertaining or no one's ever going to see it.

126
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,420
So the truth is boring.

127
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,020
The truth is boring and nuanced and takes a long time to say.

128
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Amazing.

129
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Yeah.

130
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,260
Where you can, you can find an environment where the truth is exactly what you need it

131
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,260
to be.

132
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,660
Yet some people turn their back on it because it doesn't have a cat or it's not entertaining.

133
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Oh, absolutely.

134
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,939
I mean, I find that in all the work that I do with climate.

135
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,379
He's got a second life where he's a climate advocate.

136
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:54,379
Yes.

137
00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:02,659
And it's so hard to have like very succinct, entertaining messaging because the other side

138
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,379
has stuff like drill, baby drill.

139
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,139
And we don't slogans.

140
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,139
Right.

141
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,219
Sluggans and slogans are great.

142
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:15,180
That's why you see them on bumper stickers because they work, you know, but make a sustainable

143
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,300
economy through a renewable energy baby doesn't work.

144
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
It just does.

145
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Yeah, baby.

146
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,180
Sounds like you tried that.

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,420
And failed.

148
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,939
So we've got here what might also be echo chambers where people hear what they want or

149
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,540
they look for information to they look for their understanding of information to be affirmed

150
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
and you do a Google search and you'll find it.

151
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,139
You'll find this seven other people who think exactly the way you do.

152
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,660
And there's a false affirmation.

153
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,620
So how do you sort that out for people?

154
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,939
Yeah.

155
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,060
So I mean, that confirmation bias is really a really really hard to escape.

156
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,259
And unless you're very thoughtful about doing so, you won't escape it.

157
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,620
You have to be intentional.

158
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,459
And being intentional, of course, takes a lot of mental energy, which you may not have.

159
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,019
If you pull up Instagram, usually you're not looking to change your opinion on something.

160
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,620
You're looking to spend five minutes while you're waiting for, you know, a train or something.

161
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,259
So really takes a very intentional effort to get out of this type of bubble.

162
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,259
Yeah.

163
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:24,579
The algorithms still push things towards people even though like your confirmation bias

164
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,060
is wrong.

165
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Does it still say let me go get more of this information?

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,259
Because that just makes it even worse for you then.

167
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,259
Yeah.

168
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,819
So the way I think of algorithms is really of people's attention.

169
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,219
Like what is holding people's attention?

170
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:43,500
And so inescapably platforms seek to optimize how long are people going to stay on our platform

171
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
and see more ads?

172
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The business model.

173
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:46,939
And it works extremely well.

174
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,899
And it's good for the consumer because you are interested in your entertainment while

175
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:50,899
you're watching it.

176
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,379
But the dark side is sometimes the things that hold your attention the most are not what

177
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,180
you would intellectually choose if you tick off on a paper ahead of time on watch videos

178
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
about this.

179
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,060
You find yourself slipping into like rage-bady content.

180
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,379
Things that are arousing these negative emotions.

181
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,379
Yeah.

182
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,579
And you know what's funny about that?

183
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,339
I'm embarrassed to say this.

184
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,939
I just found out.

185
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,579
I think it was our producer Alex who taught me you can just go up and put not interested

186
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:23,259
and and and it says, okay, we won't show you any more of this.

187
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,259
Yeah.

188
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,259
Which I did not know.

189
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,259
I didn't know that either.

190
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,259
Yeah.

191
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,259
And then all my crap showing up on my line.

192
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,259
Yeah.

193
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,339
And I'm like and so I'm like am I an angry guy?

194
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,779
Every video is somebody beating a crap out of somebody.

195
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,779
Yeah.

196
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:35,779
What is going on?

197
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,779
Like why does this happen?

198
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,779
It's your inner self.

199
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:38,779
It is my inner self.

200
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:39,779
I guess.

201
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,779
I think there's a truth of that.

202
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,139
You can learn a lot about somebody just by looking at 10 videos on their feet or something.

203
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,620
Probably one of the deepest ways to you know.

204
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
That's scary.

205
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Yeah it is.

206
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
It is.

207
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Yeah.

208
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,419
But now I just hit not interested because although here's the problem.

209
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:58,459
The reason I hit not interested is because I was watching it.

210
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,860
This stuff will come across and I'll be like oh my god is it Tuesday?

211
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,860
I just spent the whole day watching people get the crap beat out of them.

212
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Yeah.

213
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
And I didn't want to.

214
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,460
And this is a topic of research.

215
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,019
If you ask people do you want to see negative content and emotional content they'll tell

216
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,180
you know.

217
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,539
But if then you track what happens when they're and it comes across their feed they stick

218
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,139
through it's like a car crash.

219
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,379
You know like they everyone turns to look their head at the last second.

220
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,100
You can almost can't escape watching this content even if intellectually you think it's

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
not good for me.

222
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,940
So as an influencer you need to be sensitized to that so you know how to navigate it for

223
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,259
what you create and what you and what your expectations are.

224
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,259
Right.

225
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,259
For the audience.

226
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,259
So Gary why don't you give us a more.

227
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,259
I'll be honest with you.

228
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:44,139
All right before we do because you're fighting this disinformation you can't just go on to

229
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,580
your platform and say you know don't watch that don't listen to your dumb.

230
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,019
You just listen because this is immediately causing a problem.

231
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,419
So what are your strategies to actually get across and make this information more acceptable

232
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,620
to people who wouldn't necessarily want to know.

233
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,620
Let me ask that better.

234
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Of course.

235
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,779
English.

236
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,019
Why should anyone listen to your ass instead of anybody else if you're both talking medicine

237
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,019
online.

238
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,019
Yeah.

239
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,539
So there is this tension of who were you trying to talk to is the people who already

240
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:21,740
agree with you in which case you may sort of go for sensationalized approaches to a

241
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,179
topic or is the people in the middle who are undecided in which case you may take a more

242
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,180
nuanced approach to discussion.

243
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,299
If you want to change minds you have to do number two.

244
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,019
The problem with doing number two is it's inherently less interesting than speaking to

245
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,579
people who already agree with less.

246
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:36,979
It's not as good clickbait.

247
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:37,979
It's not.

248
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:42,259
So you have to figure out strategies in the first half a second, five seconds to kind of make

249
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,259
it entertaining.

250
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,179
Whether it's and I've done some pretty embarrassing videos where the whole theme of the video is POV,

251
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,179
point of view.

252
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,740
We're dancing at a party and I'm like dancing on screen while I'm exploring some medical

253
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
topic.

254
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,819
And the only reason I'm doing these bad dance moves on screen is to keep it entertaining.

255
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:57,819
Well, I'm discussing.

256
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
The bad dance was not bad ass dance moves.

257
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
Well, it's to be clear.

258
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,260
It depends on the video.

259
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,180
But there has to be something to get people watching.

260
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,500
So there's some common medical topics that people have strong opinions about that have

261
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,100
chosen their expert who feeds them this information.

262
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,420
So you can probably list.

263
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,900
All right, let's start off with the one that's obviously popular.

264
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,980
Is there a cure for cancer that they are keeping secrets?

265
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
It's always they.

266
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
The they.

267
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
They.

268
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,899
They being the pharmaceutical companies and the government researchers and the university

269
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,059
researchers collectively tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.

270
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,059
Right.

271
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,860
Because you know it's easier to make money off of the treatment than it is the cure.

272
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Yeah.

273
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,699
And I'm like, clearly, you know nothing about pharmaceutical companies.

274
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:48,699
Because let me tell you something.

275
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,019
If they had a cure for cancer, it'd be like, yes, we have the cure.

276
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,699
It is $1 million per pill.

277
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,699
And that happens.

278
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:57,699
That's part of the ant.

279
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,019
There's a few ways to answer this question.

280
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,299
One is the biology of the cancer itself.

281
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:03,699
One is from the pharmaceutical company's perspective.

282
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,460
And one is from social media perspective.

283
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,059
But certainly like you're saying, there are cures for some cancers.

284
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,779
You can't consider all cancer one thing.

285
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,579
It's hundreds of different diseases.

286
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,899
There will never be a treatment for all cancers.

287
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,139
But we have right now some really, really good treatments for cancers where 50 years ago,

288
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,699
survival rates were basically 0%.

289
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:29,740
The most common pediatric cancer, acute lymphobastacal leukemia, AOL, literally from 0% in the 1950s.

290
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,059
Today, something like 90% success rates with treatments.

291
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,059
Wow.

292
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,539
And then the 10% of patients who don't respond well initially, there are backup treatments

293
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:41,580
like cartete cell therapies, which happen to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but

294
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
are super effective.

295
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
Yeah.

296
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,419
And so the point is, you know, over time research does develop treatments for specific cancers.

297
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,419
And they work really well.

298
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,819
You can charge lots of money.

299
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:56,059
And you can bet that if pharmaceutical companies could sell that treatment for all cancers and

300
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,379
multiply their market size by 30 fold, they would be jumping at the opportunity to do so.

301
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,379
Right.

302
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,579
So where's the ethical compass for pharmaceutical company?

303
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:06,579
On the pricing, yes.

304
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,579
Yeah.

305
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,139
I believe it's the twisting of the mustache.

306
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,620
That's how the compass works.

307
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah.

308
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,459
So in that example, right.

309
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,180
Or the biting of the pinky.

310
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,379
You check the bank account balance and notify the shareholder.

311
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,379
Right.

312
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,340
So part of it is there's this limited period of patent exclusivity where you make as much

313
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,500
money as you can to try to justify all of your R&D that you've done up until that point.

314
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,420
And then you get generics which are much cheaper.

315
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,060
So cisplatin for a testicular cancer, metastatic, justicular cancer.

316
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,500
Used to be super low survival rate.

317
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,460
Then researchers discovered cisplatin, this drug, you've reduced mortality by something

318
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,379
like two thirds, I think, since the 1970s.

319
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,379
Wow.

320
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,379
It's generic now.

321
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,660
I think the cost of a vial, I don't know exactly, it's like tens of dollars, hundreds

322
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
of dollars.

323
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,180
So you get this initial period, we can make a lot of money off of a new drug.

324
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,180
Right.

325
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,580
And then everybody else gets to compete with you in that drug.

326
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
You see this?

327
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,580
And how much time is it?

328
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,340
I can't remember the exact number, maybe 10 years, 15 years.

329
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,820
It differs for chemical drugs or biologic drugs.

330
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,379
But wait, biology is just an extreme expression of chemistry.

331
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,379
Yeah.

332
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,580
So how do you distinguish chemical drugs from biological drugs?

333
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,020
So chemical drugs being like small molecule, maybe better example, biologics like antibody

334
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,700
drugs, where it's this protein that's been synthesized by cells.

335
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,220
So vaccines will come under their category?

336
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,259
Vaccines, I think are biologics.

337
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,259
Yeah.

338
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:29,259
That's what I'm saying.

339
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,259
Yeah.

340
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,259
But you see stuff like metastatic melanoma.

341
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:32,259
Used to have a median survival time.

342
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:37,259
And what I say used to, I'm talking about the 2000s, like 2010, median survival time of

343
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,259
six to nine months.

344
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,060
So this is skin cancer.

345
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,980
Skin cancer that has spread to your lymph nodes and maybe other places in the body.

346
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,379
People prognosis until people developed would is currently a very expensive treatment.

347
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:49,379
Melanin.

348
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,379
Yeah.

349
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:57,060
And the reason it's expensive is because it's hard as hell to be black.

350
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Tell me I'm lying.

351
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,940
Well, a warning for some sun induced skin cancer.

352
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah.

353
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Okay.

354
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
So you can't totally discount risk of skin cancer.

355
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Of course.

356
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Yeah.

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Yeah.

358
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,820
So just to be precise, the evidence that I know says that white people 25 times more likely

359
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,420
to contract skin cancer than black people.

360
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,540
All because of the melanin.

361
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,340
But risk not zero.

362
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
No.

363
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Bob Marley died of skin cancer.

364
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Yeah.

365
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
He was light skinned though.

366
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
No, no.

367
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
It was on the bottom of his foot.

368
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
It wasn't seven years.

369
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Oh, wow.

370
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
It wasn't seven years.

371
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
It was just yeah.

372
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Back to your, your anyway.

373
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
Yeah.

374
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,580
So for that metastatic melanoma 2010 median survival time six to nine months.

375
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Wow.

376
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,940
Today, I think it's almost 10 years.

377
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Wow.

378
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,460
And so the difference is that people have been doing all this basic and translational research.

379
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,540
Now we have drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that modify your immune system.

380
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,980
So your immune system can now go attack the cancer better.

381
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Right.

382
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
And they're very expensive.

383
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Yeah.

384
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

385
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Yeah.

386
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
They're currently on patent.

387
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
I think most of them are on patent.

388
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
They're going to become generic.

389
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
They will become less expensive.

390
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,180
But I can tell you the companies that make them right now would love to sell them for

391
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,940
every cancer out there if they had data showing it worked for every cancer out there.

392
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,580
Also, you get to reap the patent for the different uses.

393
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
So if like.

394
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,620
If you could, if you can modify the drug in any way to treat something else, that's

395
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
a brand new patent.

396
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,420
That's a downstream effect of these drugs to find out they've got other applications.

397
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Exactly.

398
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,500
So it has to be a meaningful.

399
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,340
You can't just take it with it and try to be cute and then say we got a new patent.

400
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
Right.

401
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,220
Because what people will do is say, well, that's not a meaningful difference.

402
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,660
We're still just going to use the generic of your first drug.

403
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
It works just as well.

404
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,660
So you really do have to make it really has to be a true alteration.

405
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Right.

406
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Okay.

407
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
That makes sense.

408
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:42,659
How's big pharma suppress natural remedies because they aren't profitable, which kind

409
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,100
of touches on what we've just been discussing?

410
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah.

411
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,779
I shouldn't say, yeah, I should say no.

412
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,339
Let's just start to that question.

413
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,500
There's actually a huge number of drugs that have natural origins.

414
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,379
And I'll think of a few examples.

415
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,379
Asperin's a good example.

416
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:56,379
Asperin, yes.

417
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,379
I think Willow Bark.

418
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,379
Yes, that's right.

419
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,699
For thousands of years, people took it and turned it into the salves or ortements or

420
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,220
whatever it was for the same properties.

421
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,740
A chemist figured out, I forget what year, but you know, this is the active compound.

422
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,660
The Willow Bark that's having these effects, if we modify it a little bit, it reduces the

423
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,779
gastrointestinal side effects, we sell that now as aspirin.

424
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,259
And clearly aspirin is not very expensive yet.

425
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,779
Or is that the buffer to aspirin that protects your stomach lining?

426
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,779
Right.

427
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,019
I'd say to say a silica acid versus salicin, I'm not a chemist.

428
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,019
Okay.

429
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,019
Okay.

430
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,019
Sound like one.

431
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,019
No.

432
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,019
But go ahead.

433
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,380
But basically, and that's one example.

434
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,100
I think like, I forget the number, 30, 40% of all drugs, FDA-approved drugs, do have

435
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
a natural origin, either directly from nature or it's been modified a little bit and then

436
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
used it.

437
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,660
And how much of that would study from indigenous cultures that had long traditions?

438
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
Some of it was.

439
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,500
Like, if there's this story of people have used this plant for hundreds or thousands of

440
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,700
years, researchers take it, isolate all the compounds, put it in this huge panel against

441
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
a cancer target, for example.

442
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
And you get a psychedelic.

443
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Yeah.

444
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
You're from found.

445
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Yeah.

446
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
I've got culture found in there.

447
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,259
But out of doubt, the plants.

448
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,660
So the misconception, I think, is if it looks like a pill, it's not natural.

449
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Right.

450
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,460
But it's very possible that the molecules in there came from the bark of some trees.

451
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Absolutely.

452
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,299
I hate when I hear people say, oh, it's not a natural remedy.

453
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,140
And I'm like, here's the thing.

454
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,660
Everything that's happening in your body is happening on a molecular basis.

455
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,340
So these people have found a way to figure out a way to isolate the molecular compounds.

456
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,459
And it's the same thing.

457
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:32,579
So now you don't have to eat a bussel full of weed.

458
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,740
You could just take a pill, dummy.

459
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,339
It's called progress.

460
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,339
Anyway, sorry.

461
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:38,339
Okay.

462
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,339
So progressing.

463
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:44,779
Our raw diets, I eat raw milk, raw meat, healthier because they're more natural.

464
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,139
And then we've got a caveat here.

465
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:49,779
What about pink Himalayan sea salt versus regular tables?

466
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:50,779
Great.

467
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:51,779
Both very closely related.

468
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:52,980
The answer is no.

469
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,619
What's where you step there?

470
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,619
I have Himalayan salt.

471
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,099
I spend a lot of money on it.

472
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,899
People will claim the pink salt has 400% more of this mineral compared to regular table

473
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:03,899
salt.

474
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:08,139
If neither of them in the first place were supplying a meaningful amount of that nutrient

475
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:11,019
or mineral to your health, it's not a difference.

476
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,419
And so the risk is actually, if you think...

477
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,699
When you're saying it's 40 times a small number, it's still a small number.

478
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:16,699
Exactly.

479
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,619
It's 1% versus 4% of your daily intake and you're getting more from meeting a mango

480
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:20,619
or whatever it might be.

481
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,619
Otherwise.

482
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,539
And so the risk is if people think pink Himalayan sea salt is healthy for me, now

483
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,059
you're using more of your food.

484
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,299
And the real health impact is second order.

485
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,740
It's now eating 3,000 milligrams of salt per day instead of 1,500 because you think it's

486
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,460
giving you these health effects.

487
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,339
And then you'd have risk for hypertension.

488
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:41,339
And the number one contributor to hypertension is salt intake.

489
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,019
So I mean, aside from heredity, like, you know, so first is...

490
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,220
Yeah, all that kind of stuff.

491
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
But first is being black.

492
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,259
Then let's be honest.

493
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,259
Okay.

494
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,259
You're black.

495
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,500
You're going to get high blood pressure.

496
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,980
But then it's your lifestyle and then sodium intake, you know.

497
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Yeah.

498
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,339
And the raw milk is similar.

499
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:07,660
There's no meaningful benefits to consuming raw milk, or raw meat compared to the past

500
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,819
revised version.

501
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,420
And so people will blow this way at a proportion.

502
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,099
I think this is where people get tribalized on social media.

503
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:17,259
You have people who very passionately only drink raw milk or who otherwise say, if you

504
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,579
do drink raw milk, you're going to die or something.

505
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,579
Right.

506
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,099
So that's the polarization of that decision.

507
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:23,099
Exactly.

508
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,459
And people's lived experiences are, well, I drink raw milk all the time and so do my

509
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,459
friends.

510
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,740
And none of us have died.

511
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
What are you talking about?

512
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Right.

513
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,299
And realistically, you know, maybe hundreds or a couple thousand people may be hospitalized

514
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,299
per year from doing it.

515
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,419
It's not a big risk, but it's an unnecessary risk because there's no benefit from drinking

516
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,939
raw milk compared to past your ass.

517
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:41,939
Right.

518
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:42,939
But the people say there is a benefit.

519
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,339
What reasons are they giving?

520
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,339
Yeah.

521
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:46,939
And what are the supposed benefits?

522
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:47,939
Because this is...

523
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,939
This got really big up a couple of months ago.

524
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:50,939
It did.

525
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:51,939
It did get huge.

526
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:52,939
It was a movement.

527
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,740
And people like identify as raw milk as an anti-establishment statement almost.

528
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,340
And there are proposed things like it's got these undenatured proteins or enzymes or

529
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,500
live bacteria in it, which mechanistically we think will help your health.

530
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,019
I haven't seen any evidence to support any of those actual benefits as being truly beneficial.

531
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,779
But somebody came up with it.

532
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:14,779
Yeah, they did.

533
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,779
To assume that it's true.

534
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,779
Right.

535
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,380
And I know who that guy was.

536
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Just hang on.

537
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
Moving on.

538
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,380
Oh GMO foods, bad for your health.

539
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
For your health?

540
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
No.

541
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,220
I have no concern eating a genetically modified food.

542
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,620
The fact that there's a modified gene in there or leading to a modified protein, you digest

543
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,860
it just like any other protein or DNA in all the food that we eat.

544
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,940
There is though sort of a second level of effect.

545
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,940
It's not bad from you eating the modified corn or whatever.

546
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,180
And I'm not an expert on this part.

547
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,740
But what are the environmental impacts of now having this model culture and having companies

548
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,140
being in control of the seeds that are used to make that particular product or different

549
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,019
pesticide use that are specific for those modified things?

550
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,060
Those are all separate questions from if I eat this modified soy or corn.

551
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,779
Is it going to directly arm my health?

552
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,019
To that part the answer is very clearly no.

553
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,019
Right.

554
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,700
So what you're saying is that there are separate arguments that you can make against GMOs,

555
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,539
but not the one that talks about whether or not it's harmful.

556
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,539
To you physiologically.

557
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,539
Right.

558
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,539
Right.

559
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,259
And there's quite a lot of decades of research from very large populations.

560
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,140
So I mean, there's not health risks from eating the modified version of this.

561
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,900
By the way, isn't most crops monocrops?

562
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Yeah.

563
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,100
Whether or not it's GMO, I mean, isn't...

564
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
I don't know the answer to that.

565
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,259
I know for corn and soy and stuff, I think like 90% plus RGMO.

566
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,259
Right.

567
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,500
So if you're eating any corn based product.

568
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah.

569
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
And maybe there's something to be said there.

570
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,220
If the process of GMO makes corn more available in our diet and that meaningfully shifts the

571
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,660
overall food profile that we're eating, maybe that shift has an impact on our dietary intake

572
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
overall as a culture.

573
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
True.

574
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,299
There's nothing to do with the corn itself versus an unmodified corn.

575
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,299
Right.

576
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:06,099
And by the way, I don't know if you've ever seen heirloom corn, but it's true that crap.

577
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:07,099
Okay.

578
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,740
Like the corn that's modified is juicy and delicious.

579
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Yeah.

580
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
It's not sweet at everything.

581
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,059
It's not this pink and purple and blue strivet up little thing that they call corn.

582
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,059
Yeah.

583
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,059
Yeah.

584
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,059
So...

585
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:25,859
I think there's very little foods sold in a supermarket that matches its ungenetically

586
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:26,859
modified ancestor.

587
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:27,859
Oh, yeah.

588
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:28,859
Absolutely.

589
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:31,819
So if it's not laboratory GMO, it'd be farmer GMO.

590
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:32,819
Farmers GMO.

591
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:33,819
Right.

592
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,819
Because at some point it's a dover century.

593
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:35,819
Exactly.

594
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,940
And I don't have people saying they should label the food if it's GMO.

595
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:45,660
And while that's surely not necessary, if you did do that, I would say label it to GMO

596
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,660
and then have one branch and is it scientists GMO or is it farmer GMO?

597
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
Right.

598
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
And then every food item in the...

599
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Would be GMO.

600
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Would be GMO from kind of.

601
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,740
Anytime you make a hybrid or crossbreed or do anything like that, you're genetically

602
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
modifying the plants.

603
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
Yeah.

604
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
It's carrots, isn't it?

605
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Carrots originally were purple.

606
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Yeah.

607
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
By the way, I love purple carrots there.

608
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
There you go.

609
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Right.

610
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Moving on.

611
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,460
These types of broader public health initiatives, if you take them away, it's not going to harm

612
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,859
everyone equally, assuming there is a benefit.

613
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:16,859
Interesting.

614
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,019
Who's going to most deeply impact?

615
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,700
The people who have least access to dental care.

616
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
To care.

617
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,859
Who have least access to fluoridated toothpates and regular tooth brushing.

618
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:25,859
Right.

619
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:30,740
There's a large chunk of society who possibly wouldn't see as much of a big health impact

620
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,339
compared to another section of society who may see massive disproportionate impacts.

621
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,940
That dialogue has never discussed.

622
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,259
No one ever talks about it.

623
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,259
Right.

624
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,900
And certainly, if you happen to be in a very privileged stance, you can't decide just

625
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,460
based on yourself for a very broad public health met.

626
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
You shouldn't.

627
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,299
You certainly can and people often do.

628
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,299
Yeah.

629
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:54,620
So, following up on your sort of comment and cleverness it was, what are some of the red

630
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,500
flags the content might be misinformed?

631
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,059
What gets your ears pricked up and go, oh, hello.

632
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:03,059
Good stuff.

633
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,339
It's a strong overlap with the type of content that is very intriguing to watch.

634
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,619
And so you'll see anecdotes being presented.

635
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,659
I have three friends who had very late stage cancer.

636
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:17,899
They took XYZ medications and now none of them have cancer.

637
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:18,899
Hydroxychloroquine.

638
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:19,899
Okay.

639
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,419
Yeah, I wasn't going to name medications.

640
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,419
Yeah.

641
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,259
This is a different podcast.

642
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,700
That is frequently done.

643
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,500
So anecdotes being presented in place of evidence is an immediate red flag.

644
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
But it's also really compelling.

645
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
It's a different evidence.

646
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,299
They think it's evidence when they present an evidence.

647
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,859
And there's a saying, the plural of anecdotes is not data.

648
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:38,859
Nice.

649
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,980
I need that on a t-shirt.

650
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Yes.

651
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,299
But only scientists have even their slogans are boring.

652
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,099
The plural of anecdotes is not data.

653
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,420
Which is beautiful to say.

654
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,980
I wish most people got it though.

655
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Yeah.

656
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,980
And it's not a replacement for a controlled clinical study where you're monitoring all these

657
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,460
different variables that otherwise can easily confound whatever you're looking at.

658
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,460
But what I tell people when they say, I have aunt who took this herbal cure for cancer

659
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
and she's doing just fine right now.

660
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,660
And I say the nine people who took that oral cure and are now dead are not being interviewed

661
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
by anybody.

662
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
No.

663
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:22,819
How much of what gets put out on social media has behind it a conflict of interest?

664
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:23,980
That's a major red flag.

665
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,900
So if you see somebody telling you, oh, this autoimmune disease and this cancer and this

666
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,100
heart disease are all due to a deficiency in these three vitamins, which if you go to

667
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,220
the link in my bio, I happen to be selling in a vial for $90 per month.

668
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,900
Can you really trust that these very broad statements?

669
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,380
First of all, making broad statements like that, there's a reason why people see individual

670
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,019
nutritionists and dieticians and doctors is because you can't give prescriptive advice

671
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,259
like if you take more vitamin D, you can solve your autoimmune disease.

672
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,580
That's simply not true.

673
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,940
But if you're selling a vitamin D capsule, you're very motivated to make that type of statement.

674
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Okay.

675
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,820
So that's another red flag there.

676
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Yeah.

677
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,180
However, just because there's selling to you doesn't mean it doesn't work.

678
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Correct.

679
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,420
So this would only mean you just want to be a little more cautious.

680
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,700
But it's not an immediate disqualifying event.

681
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Exactly.

682
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,380
So I would start from a place of skepticism to start.

683
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,059
And then if you see, oh, there's conflict of interest and they're presenting only anecdotes

684
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:19,620
and they're being sensationalized and exaggerating.

685
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,660
And they're claiming that there's one particular treatment is helping with five different diseases.

686
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,460
And they're really charismatic.

687
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,579
And they're really charismatic.

688
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,740
Then your guardrails should be almost at the roof.

689
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Wow.

690
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Okay.

691
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,819
So that's the universal cural tablet potion lotion.

692
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:36,819
Yeah.

693
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,340
If somebody's selling you something and they say you've got autoimmune disease or heart disease

694
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,299
or cancer or you're feeling depressed, maybe you need more of this thing that costs $100

695
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,299
a month.

696
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,620
Is it the same as the dude that sells elixir?

697
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
The tonic.

698
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
The tonic?

699
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,620
Yes.

700
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
From the back of the wagon.

701
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
The snake oil sales oil.

702
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,620
Yeah.

703
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,019
And the same thing, but on the internet today, walking in the same principle, working to

704
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,019
the same audience.

705
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,019
Exactly.

706
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,019
And vulnerable to those.

707
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,019
To sexual humans.

708
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,019
Yeah.

709
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,019
And that's exactly it.

710
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,939
Because when you're feeling vulnerable, when you're feeling like, I've been to the doctor,

711
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,779
they told me they don't know exactly what's going on.

712
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,699
But this person says, maybe they do.

713
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,059
And they've got this thing they can sell me.

714
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,059
Maybe it'll work.

715
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,779
If you weren't feeling vulnerable in that moment, you might easily identify that as, oh,

716
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:19,779
they're just grifting.

717
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,779
They're trying to make a buck.

718
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,379
So they're looking for the desperate, the last refuge.

719
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,820
So the desperate find them.

720
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Yes.

721
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Right.

722
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
All right.

723
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,100
The other one is false dichotomies and polarized thinking.

724
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Yeah.

725
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
So this is another example.

726
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,700
Things that perform super well on social media.

727
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,900
If you say, if you don't eat a totally plant-based or a totally carnivore diet, you're at

728
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,500
risk for all these different diseases.

729
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,180
The reality is in between.

730
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,060
Like, obviously, if you eat more whole plant-based foods, and vegetables, and nuts, and legumes,

731
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,420
and whole grains, that's better for your health.

732
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,100
But it's not like you can't occasionally have some non-plant-based foods.

733
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,619
It's a spectrum.

734
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:57,740
But the type of content that's always going to perform really well is where you make

735
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,939
these really big, bold, sensational claims that aren't necessarily reflective of the scientific

736
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,179
reality.

737
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:05,819
How is one to know that?

738
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:09,139
Is the evidence that they're making an extraordinary claim?

739
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:10,139
Yeah.

740
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:11,139
That's the evidence.

741
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,299
That's one of these things where, if that's ticking a box on the content, they're making

742
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,179
this super exaggerated claim.

743
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,179
Wow.

744
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,179
So this should be like a toolkit.

745
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,179
Like a checklist.

746
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,179
Yeah.

747
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:21,179
And a checklist, you sound around.

748
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,140
Do we believe that the medical misinformation is known to be misinformation by the people

749
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
peddling it?

750
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,019
Or do they actually think it's real?

751
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,019
Yes.

752
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,740
Because if they think it's real, then someone else has to know it's misinformation, enough

753
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
the person to deliver it.

754
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,980
But it becomes misinformation, and then if they know that it's false, and that's still

755
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
shared, then it becomes disinformation.

756
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Yeah.

757
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
Yeah.

758
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
I think there's both.

759
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,820
I think a lot of the time, people do genuinely believe that things are saying.

760
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,700
Even if they're selling the product to fix this deficiency, whatever.

761
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,259
They're not doing it.

762
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,259
Sometimes they may be.

763
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,779
But they're not always doing it knowingly deceiving you.

764
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,059
A lot of the time, I think people do believe the things that they're peddling.

765
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,500
And that boosts their sincerity on camera.

766
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Right.

767
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Right?

768
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Yeah.

769
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
And I don't think you can do it otherwise.

770
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,140
You can't sit in front of a camera and lie to people for years knowingly just extracting

771
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
money from them.

772
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
Some people can.

773
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Most people, I don't think, could.

774
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,059
Well, I think what people do psychologically is convince themselves.

775
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,779
So they lie to themselves first until they believe their own lie.

776
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,779
Who's that can happen?

777
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:27,859
And then they're able to promulgate that lie convincingly because they actually believe

778
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,859
it.

779
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:29,859
Yeah.

780
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,980
And this, up until recently, I wasn't sure of some of the biggest sort of peddlers of

781
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,619
disinformation and questionable supplements really believe what they were talking about.

782
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:42,500
I watched this crazy video about Joe Maricola, one of the largest sort of supplement salesmen

783
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,259
and pushers of misinformation.

784
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:49,900
He's been reporting showing he consults with what he believes is an entity from the causal

785
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
plane.

786
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,180
He gets on zoom sessions with this sort of sear person who is relaying messages from this

787
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,299
other plane of existence, astonishing to show that, you know, he truly believes that this

788
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:06,420
person is channeling this other entity and guiding his business practice and the types

789
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
of information.

790
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,740
And he's going to be one of the top 10 suppliers like medical institutions in the world, stunning

791
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,819
to see the videos of these zoom sessions.

792
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:19,139
And realize he's not making this up from his mansion just to try to sell people more

793
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,139
supplements.

794
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:24,339
There's something deeper going on here.

795
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,419
This information, misinformation is one thing.

796
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:34,899
When you angle it and you bring it in an anti-science way, this can't just be, we don't

797
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:35,899
like science.

798
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:36,899
Let's move on.

799
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:37,899
There must be strategies.

800
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:42,220
There must be ways which this messaging is being pushed and delivered.

801
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,579
By the way, it's not only anti-science, it's also, well, I don't trust scientists.

802
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:53,259
You have the urge to say, well, trust me on an expert, but then anyone can say that.

803
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,980
And so why should I trust you and not someone else?

804
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Right.

805
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,420
Or someone with the exact same credentials, PhDs, doctors all the time, make statements that

806
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,180
are totally incorrect.

807
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,420
And many of them have the pedigree of what school they attended or they were awarded in.

808
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Right.

809
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Yeah.

810
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,779
I think that you're coming about trust is a huge one.

811
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:14,819
If most people think about the FDA or the NIH or the CDC, there's probably not a face

812
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:15,819
that comes to mind.

813
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:16,819
That's the oddle.

814
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:17,819
At all.

815
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:20,700
Maybe one person, but even if there's one person, they don't know what that person is

816
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,700
like in their free time.

817
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,299
They don't know what, if they have a family or what they enjoy.

818
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,859
That's the opposite of what happens on social media.

819
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,700
You develop these deep, like personal relationships almost with people that you see, whether they're

820
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,259
pushing misinformation or evidence-based information.

821
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,220
And I think it takes that human connection to actually build up trust in whatever someone

822
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
is saying.

823
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,539
Wait, so you're saying that the people who are peddling misinformation are developing a

824
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,059
relationship with their viewer where the viewer trusts them?

825
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,059
Absolutely.

826
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,059
Yeah.

827
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,059
Okay.

828
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,059
So how's the trust going in your TikTok channel?

829
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,059
Yeah.

830
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,059
So aside from medical information videos.

831
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,059
You're a very brutal guy.

832
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,059
Okay.

833
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,059
And I'll do you know what I hate.

834
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,980
You're a hater, so it's just like you're so full of, you know, sometimes there's some

835
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
selection.

836
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
You're working for the big pharma.

837
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Chuck.

838
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
I hate some.

839
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
I hate haters.

840
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Haters going hate.

841
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,860
I hate the viewership you get all manner of comments.

842
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,299
But part of it is not just making like, I'm going to tell you about ibuprofen today.

843
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,620
Some, you know, I make videos with my dog or I'll do a little silly dancing video where

844
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
I trend or something.

845
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,380
Just to show that you are a real person.

846
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,420
You're not just parroting data from a research paper.

847
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,900
With a lab coat.

848
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Yeah.

849
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,819
In fact, the most memorable DM I've ever received is back in 2021.

850
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,339
Everyone had questions about the COVID vaccine.

851
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:33,620
So I was talking about that for 99% of the live stream.

852
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,620
I come to the very end of it and I say, I've got to go.

853
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:37,619
My wife is almost home from the hospital.

854
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,059
I've got to go cook a dinner and then I end the live stream.

855
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,059
Cool.

856
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,579
And then all the comments were about that.

857
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:46,419
The message I got afterwards was I didn't know if I believed you about the COVID vaccines.

858
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:47,419
I don't know if I can trust you.

859
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,019
I don't know if I can trust science until you said the reason you were leaving was to go

860
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,539
cook a dinner for your wife.

861
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,979
And I realized like you're just a normal person.

862
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:55,979
Right.

863
00:33:55,979 --> 00:34:02,579
But so what is the best strategy for viewers who want to know rather than absorb information

864
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:09,739
from someone who is very entertaining and very personable, but may not be the right source?

865
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,739
Where do they go?

866
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,940
Is it do your own research?

867
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,380
Have you done the research?

868
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
Niels talked about it.

869
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,699
You've got this confirmation bias.

870
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:21,819
How do you sort of navigate through that for getting the right information?

871
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:22,819
Right.

872
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,619
Especially since you have a PhD.

873
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,299
How many years did it take for your PhD?

874
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,299
Four and a half.

875
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,059
So for nearly five years, focusing on that one topic.

876
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,059
Right.

877
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,059
Right.

878
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:36,460
And then you know, some papers published and they're people who spend half hour in an afternoon.

879
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
I did the research.

880
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I did the research.

881
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Yeah, which could be listening to a podcast.

882
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
It could be.

883
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Exactly.

884
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,980
And watching a YouTube video.

885
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,659
And so the short answer is realistically, I think most people can't do their own research

886
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,900
in the way that I would interpret doing one's own research on a topic.

887
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
And so what you're up to is.

888
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,699
In fact, half a graduate school is learning how to be a graduate student.

889
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,299
It's really, it's complex not just to find the relevant research papers, but to critically

890
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,660
interpret their study design and the results in the context of the broader literature.

891
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,300
You're talking hundreds of hours of just time spent reading in a given topic area.

892
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
No one's going to do that.

893
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,820
Certainly not after watching an Instagram video and then questioning.

894
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,660
Is this medically accurate?

895
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,780
And so what you're left with, unfortunately, is you do have to identify people or institutions

896
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
that you trust.

897
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,580
I was going to say trusted sources is really the key.

898
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,340
You're never going to go do all of the research required on every given medical topic or topic,

899
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,500
you know, in general in your life.

900
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,059
So do the institutions need to do more to make this accessible in the face of the fact

901
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,340
that science seems to have been weaponized and turned against itself?

902
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,420
Yeah, I think there's a critical shortcoming in that.

903
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,500
If people were to tune in to the four hour discussion section where the CDC talks about

904
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,739
the benefits and risks of this vaccine or this intervention, you would very quickly realize

905
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:55,340
these people are taking a very rigorous approach to both the medical risks and the benefits.

906
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I trust them to come up with the right answer.

907
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,740
You never see any of that, even though it's technically publicly available, because all

908
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,100
of the focus, most of the focus, is not on communicating those sort of inner details

909
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,860
of how these decisions are made.

910
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,460
It ends up being this is the decision of the recommendation for good reason.

911
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,420
Perhaps because then doctors can take that and make that recommendation known.

912
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,660
But I think things have shifted even just since COVID.

913
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,260
I think we would really benefit from personalization of these big institutions in a way that

914
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,019
people feel they know people at them.

915
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:31,420
Okay, I'm old enough to remember, this would be mid-80s now, early 80s, where the Surgeon

916
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,940
General, C. Everkoube, came out and said you got to wear condoms, prevent the spread

917
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
of AIDS.

918
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,059
I don't think anyone had publicly said the word condom before.

919
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,059
Right.

920
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:44,219
It's supposed to be not a public official.

921
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,860
And people trusted him.

922
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,219
Plus he had his little sex education in school and that was about it.

923
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,219
Yeah.

924
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,939
And certain grandpa element to him.

925
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:55,779
He was a face of the nation's medicine.

926
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:59,179
And Fauci maybe was that, but not really.

927
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,739
So is that the solution here?

928
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:02,419
I think that's a big part of it.

929
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:06,019
It's really humanizing the process of how do we come to these recommendations in the

930
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:07,339
first place?

931
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:11,659
And then we trust your recommendation because we know the process you've gone through.

932
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:15,379
People are never going to sit down and do 300 hours worth of research on a topic.

933
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,260
There's someone with a PhD in pharmacology and I will mention immunology.

934
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:27,059
Explain the actual science of how vaccines work and how the body then goes to create the

935
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:28,059
necessary antibodies.

936
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,660
It's actually the same process as when you're infected with a virus.

937
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Right.

938
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
And so it's the same answer for both.

939
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,340
I'll answer it from a vaccine standpoint.

940
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,340
You get the injection in your arm.

941
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,820
What have you just injected?

942
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,539
Most often little pieces of the pathogen.

943
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,219
So what happens in your arm tissue?

944
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:45,820
Pretty much nothing right there.

945
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,659
You've got one big immune cell that comes in and scoops it up.

946
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:51,179
It takes it to your draining lymph node is what it's called.

947
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:53,739
So it goes through this whole separate pathway in your body.

948
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,820
You've got your blood circulatory system.

949
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
Most people don't know.

950
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,860
You actually have a separate almost circulation system called lymph.

951
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
And a phatic system.

952
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,900
So the white blood cells travel from wherever you got the injection.

953
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,619
It carries it back to a lymph node and it starts showing it to all these other immune

954
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,619
cells.

955
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,619
And it says, do you recognize this?

956
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:10,619
No.

957
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,619
Do you recognize this?

958
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:12,619
It finds one.

959
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:13,619
It's like a lineup.

960
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,619
It is.

961
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,739
And the neat part is all of those cells that are just sitting in your lymph node waiting

962
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:20,259
to be shown something they recognize.

963
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,259
They like this.

964
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:22,259
Exactly.

965
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,259
Like the guy for the car at the air.

966
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:25,259
They don't recognize it.

967
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:26,259
Nothing happens.

968
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:29,659
And then the one lymph node is just like take your time.

969
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,659
It's okay.

970
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:31,659
Exactly.

971
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,940
The immune cells get entirely working along.

972
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,539
But all of those cells were randomly generated in advance.

973
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:41,579
So before COVID ever existed, you had in your body T cells in your body.

974
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,340
And B cells that recognized COVID.

975
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,380
And then when you eventually got infected for the first time, we got your vaccine, it

976
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,980
was like their time to shine basically.

977
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,059
They're like, oh, hey, I know that one.

978
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,380
When that happens, that cell gets activated.

979
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,380
It multiplies.

980
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
Multiplies multiplies.

981
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,059
It starts making antibodies that go back to your site of infection, go throughout your

982
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:00,059
whole body.

983
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,139
It also activates T cells.

984
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,659
So T cells are the ones that recognize, oh, that friendly cells infected with a virus.

985
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,659
I better kill that cell.

986
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,659
I better kill that cell.

987
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:09,659
Right.

988
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:10,659
Exactly.

989
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,619
And then the combination of antibodies that are floating around to neutralize the virus

990
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:18,980
when it's in between cells and T cells to kill the ones that are incubating virus actively.

991
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,739
And that same process happens whether you've been affected with a virus.

992
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:25,500
It still takes the piece of virus and goes to the lymph node and activates the B and T cells.

993
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,940
Here's something I never understood.

994
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,099
There are people who had pretty serious side effects to the COVID vaccine.

995
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,819
If the vaccine is doing what COVID itself would have done, does that mean they would have

996
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:38,619
had those same side effects had they gotten COVID straight up?

997
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:39,619
I don't think so.

998
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,259
I don't know of data to say one way or the other.

999
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:44,420
If the severity of your vaccine response is predictive.

1000
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,900
I don't know the data one way.

1001
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
That's honest.

1002
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
You get them all honest.

1003
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Honest but boring, that's what.

1004
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
I can cope with that.

1005
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,420
No, I just want to call out that when a scientist is speaking and they're honest about

1006
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,900
their work and they don't say I don't know one way or another.

1007
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
That's honest.

1008
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
I'd rather that.

1009
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Right.

1010
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Yeah.

1011
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
But you could lie to us and be really confident and do what you say.

1012
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Yeah, man.

1013
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,940
If you got a bad fever after the injection, you would have died from COVID.

1014
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,659
I don't know one way or the other.

1015
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,619
My suspicion is that there's probably not much of a link between the two and also that

1016
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:17,900
it would be very hard to test because obviously once you are vaccinated, you're not going

1017
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
to get infected.

1018
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
You're not going to get infected.

1019
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
You're not going to get infected.

1020
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,619
And by the way, your infection, if you do get it, it's going to be lessened by the fact

1021
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,619
that you've been vaccinated.

1022
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:25,619
Right.

1023
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,380
So yeah, it's like trying to get toothpaste back in the tube.

1024
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Yeah, yeah.

1025
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,380
It'll happen.

1026
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,820
Let's talk about the less extreme misunderstandings about vaccines starting with, can you have

1027
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,619
too many vaccinations?

1028
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:37,619
Hmm.

1029
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,179
The short answer is no.

1030
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:44,420
There comes a point where if you keep vaccinating against a certain pathogen, you don't get additional

1031
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
benefit.

1032
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,059
There's actually really big results just published for HPV vaccines, one dose versus two doses.

1033
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:51,739
The human papaloma virus.

1034
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:52,739
That's right.

1035
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:53,900
The one that causes cervical cancer.

1036
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,699
Going from one dose to two doses is not that much better than one dose.

1037
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:59,099
But very important to know that.

1038
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,099
Right.

1039
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,099
Critically.

1040
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,699
But that has to be trials have to reveal that.

1041
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,699
Right.

1042
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:04,699
Or as you wouldn't know.

1043
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:05,699
Yeah.

1044
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,699
No, this is the result of decades of clinical studies.

1045
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:10,059
Maybe to your question, though, of in general, like people talk about, oh, my child's

1046
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:12,819
going to receive X number of vaccines over Y number of years.

1047
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:13,819
Right.

1048
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,659
To that one, the answer is definitely no.

1049
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:18,579
If you consider the total number of pathogens we're exposed to on a daily basis.

1050
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,579
Right.

1051
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:20,579
Think about your entire gut.

1052
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,939
It's constantly being sampled for bacteria and viruses and everything.

1053
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:28,019
And then your immune system is secreting antibodies into your gut to regulate your gut microbiome.

1054
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,619
An additional one or 10 pathogens per vaccine is a drop in the bucket compared to everything

1055
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:33,619
that's happening.

1056
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:34,619
You've got all the time.

1057
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,940
By the way, I cannot emphasize enough that the comparison he gave is very common in

1058
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
science.

1059
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,859
You can say, will this harm me?

1060
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:44,859
Right.

1061
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:49,739
And yeah, but look at all the other things you're doing and you're not worried about

1062
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:52,139
that harming you and those risk are 10 times as high.

1063
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:53,139
Right.

1064
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,139
So it's not a harm.

1065
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:57,380
It's that's very important comparison to make.

1066
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,659
And it's a statistical comparison that I don't think people are comfortable or have

1067
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:01,659
experience doing.

1068
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:02,779
Yeah.

1069
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:07,099
Well, because the way they intuit is intuition is false.

1070
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,099
It's his false.

1071
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,099
Yeah.

1072
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:13,379
They intuit wrongly because they say, well, if I took this vaccine and this vaccine and

1073
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:18,899
this vaccine and this vaccine, all at the same time, my body must not be able to handle

1074
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:19,899
that.

1075
00:42:19,899 --> 00:42:23,779
And that is what is causing this disease or this condition or what.

1076
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:29,139
But the truth is your body is responding to it because it's responding to that all

1077
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:30,139
the time.

1078
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:31,139
Yeah.

1079
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:34,219
Well, this goes back to the fact there's all these cells sitting in your lymph node waiting

1080
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,219
for their target.

1081
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,219
Right.

1082
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,900
Just because you activate this one, this other one is still available just waiting for

1083
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
its target.

1084
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,259
You can activate both at the same time.

1085
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,259
At the same time.

1086
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,259
And they're doing it.

1087
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:44,259
They're doing different things.

1088
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,819
They're fighting different things.

1089
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:48,179
It's not like one is stepping on the other.

1090
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,179
Right.

1091
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:52,699
You know, they're both going to it's like a five alarm fire.

1092
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,699
One fire station is called then a second fire station is called.

1093
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,339
They don't cancel each other out.

1094
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,420
They help each other do their thing.

1095
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,539
You know, one takes one part of the house, one takes another.

1096
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,539
So yeah.

1097
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:05,539
All right.

1098
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,019
A couple of other less extreme misunderstandings to go through.

1099
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:14,180
Can you firstly overload the immune system or can you boost the immune system?

1100
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Oh, great question.

1101
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,180
That's wow.

1102
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,940
You both cannot boost your immune system in the ways you're thinking of.

1103
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,620
Nor do I think it would be a good idea to boost your immune system.

1104
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,700
You want to balance your immune system actually.

1105
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,340
If you get too much immune activity, you know what you end up with.

1106
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,320
Autoimmune disease.

1107
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Right.

1108
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,320
If you get too little immune activity in your body, that increases your risk for cancer.

1109
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,960
And so it's this balance between having just enough immune activity to respond to acute

1110
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,519
infections and stuff.

1111
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,240
But even if you could boost your immunity by taking some supplement, I don't know that

1112
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
you would want to do so.

1113
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Right.

1114
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
It's okay.

1115
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,400
It's funny because when we start out in life, that's the whole idea.

1116
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,680
It's not to keep your child away.

1117
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,480
Just let them go do whatever because they're going to encounter these pathogens naturally.

1118
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,039
And then their body, their immune system is going to develop accordingly.

1119
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,039
Yeah.

1120
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,480
I should say there are things you can do to reduce the function of your immune system.

1121
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,079
So you don't want to be not getting enough sleep.

1122
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,079
Right.

1123
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,079
I should say it in the way that you should do it.

1124
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,079
You should get high quality, high quality sleep.

1125
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,079
You don't double make it sleep.

1126
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,079
Yeah.

1127
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,079
Confusing myself.

1128
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,079
So get proper sleep.

1129
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:19,119
Sleep, nutrition, physical activity, right?

1130
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,359
Low stress over time.

1131
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:21,359
These things are boring.

1132
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,559
They do meaningfully impact your immune response.

1133
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,119
If you sleep to pry someone before giving them a vaccine, you can measure differences in

1134
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,599
the titers they're going to develop, like in the days leading up to an after vaccine.

1135
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,320
But in the what they're going to develop?

1136
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,039
Like the antibody responses to that vaccine will be worse if you've sleep to pry them for

1137
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,360
the days leading up to it.

1138
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Look at that.

1139
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,679
So the basic lifestyle stuff, like if you experiment someone's conducted, it is.

1140
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:44,679
Yeah.

1141
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,679
We've got to be on a balance table.

1142
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,679
So if you're doing those things.

1143
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:52,679
And I took the vaccine.

1144
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,679
No.

1145
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,719
If you're doing sort of the basic lifestyle stuff that you know already for every other disease

1146
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,000
on the planet, that's basically the extent of what you want to do to be caring for your

1147
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
immune system.

1148
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,039
It's also going to help you with everything else.

1149
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,719
Before we go on to bring on my next guest, why is it that some vaccines need to be boosted

1150
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:11,719
later on?

1151
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,119
Where's others don't?

1152
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,119
Great question.

1153
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,079
So in other words, you can be immune.

1154
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,400
You can be vaccinated for life with one kind, but another one you need to.

1155
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Measles is like that.

1156
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Is that right?

1157
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Yeah.

1158
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,400
If you've got a measles shot as a child back in the 60s, you're probably going to need a

1159
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,279
booster right now.

1160
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,360
There's two levels of variability here.

1161
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,480
One is across different pathogens.

1162
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Some pathogens are capsular and it's harder to get longer lasting, you know, antibody

1163
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,400
responses against what you need to get responses against.

1164
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,159
You just need to get boosted.

1165
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,920
Those infections, if you get them, maybe you get infections more recurrently with rhino

1166
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,559
viruses or different coronaviruses.

1167
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,039
It's not like you get infected once in your life and then you never get that pathogen

1168
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,039
again.

1169
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,519
Over time, maybe your immunity wanes for whatever reason.

1170
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,000
So there's differences across pathogens just based on the structure.

1171
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There's also big differences.

1172
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
These are structures.

1173
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,639
You mean they're physical, how the molecules, whatever connect themselves.

1174
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,639
Yeah.

1175
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,840
And how that primes your memory immune response to be either longer lasting or not.

1176
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Interesting.

1177
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,960
But then there's also huge differences across people in the variability of both the potency

1178
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,360
of your immune response and the duration that it lasts.

1179
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,880
And you can't tell based on how you feel.

1180
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,480
And so there's two levels of variability there.

1181
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,880
Overpopulation, it works great.

1182
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,000
But at any given person for any given pathogen, you could see hugely different persisting antibody

1183
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,800
levels 20, 30 years after vaccination.

1184
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:40,400
I heard this saying no medicine is good for anyone until it has been tested on everyone.

1185
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Wow.

1186
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Yeah.

1187
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
So some truth to that, right?

1188
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Absolutely.

1189
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,079
So you can't test it on everyone because you have sample sizes.

1190
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,360
But if you test it on a thousand people and there's a one in a million reaction that someone

1191
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,000
might have to it, you won't know that in that sample of a thousand.

1192
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Right.

1193
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,320
Which is the whole value of doing post marketing surveillance, which is done very surprisingly

1194
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
very big.

1195
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
That's your best word surveillance.

1196
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Come on.

1197
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
You can't please post it.

1198
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Follow up.

1199
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Post marketing follow up.

1200
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Yes.

1201
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,280
Where you've got these databases looking out for signals of potential risk.

1202
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,519
And if one pops up, you know, that's probably anecdotal, but it serves as the basis for a

1203
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:19,000
rigorous investigation that you go do then afterwards.

1204
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Got it.

1205
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,200
And so tell me, and just to end it here, tell me about the vaccine adverse system.

1206
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,360
Adverse effects reporting system.

1207
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
There's.

1208
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
There's.

1209
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Yeah.

1210
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,480
So it's exactly that type of monitoring system where we've tested these vaccines in this

1211
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
number of people.

1212
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,160
It looks good in that number of people.

1213
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,000
We're not going to test it in 300 million people before we release it.

1214
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,400
And you're getting safety signals.

1215
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,679
If the same thing starts to pop up over time, you say, well, we should go do a formal study.

1216
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,400
And look, if that's actually associated with the vaccine, it's really an excuse to focus in.

1217
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Right.

1218
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,960
For things that could be very rare that you would never see in a typical clinical trial,

1219
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,840
even if you had 10,000, 20,000 people in the clinical study.

1220
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
Because it's one in a million or one in a ten million.

1221
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Right.

1222
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,159
And so there's some noise because these things are voluntarily reported.

1223
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,320
And sometimes things do happen by coincidence.

1224
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,840
That's what the V stands were.

1225
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
Volunteer.

1226
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,280
And a V stands for vaccine.

1227
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,600
Yeah, vaccine adverse event reporting system.

1228
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:22,720
So this relies entirely on someone knowing it exists, logging on and typing in some effect.

1229
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Right.

1230
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,880
So it's often healthcare providers who will log it.

1231
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,480
They'll say the person got this vaccine.

1232
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
All good.

1233
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,880
So they had this professional in the loop.

1234
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,800
Very good to know that.

1235
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,240
But just because it's in the system doesn't mean it's necessarily related.

1236
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,840
It's a starting point for investigation.

1237
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,920
And that's where it goes wrong.

1238
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,720
People will say, look, how many reports there were in the system.

1239
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,199
But of course, what happens if you vaccinate 30 million children, some of those children

1240
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:45,919
are going to have other things happen to them.

1241
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:46,919
That are unrelated.

1242
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:47,919
Oh, yeah.

1243
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:48,919
But that may be related.

1244
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:49,919
That might be related.

1245
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,919
But they may not be.

1246
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:54,679
There's some rare other thing that it's time coincident with.

1247
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:56,439
And there's not a cause and effect.

1248
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:57,439
Right.

1249
00:48:57,439 --> 00:49:00,279
And so it's critical to have to identify when there are true signals.

1250
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:04,039
You can't rely on it to show that vaccines are dangerous for XYZ.

1251
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:05,039
Right.

1252
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:06,039
Yes.

1253
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,039
Interesting.

1254
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:08,599
I'm wrong here.

1255
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,679
When the COVID vaccine arrived and it wasn't yet enough for everybody.

1256
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:16,480
So they did for responders and then teachers.

1257
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,880
I think that rollout felt sensible to me.

1258
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:27,559
All of us who remembered things like the polio vaccine and the smallpox vaccine fully expected

1259
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,519
that once you got that vaccine, you would never get COVID again.

1260
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,039
But that is not what happened.

1261
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,320
And then it's a wasn't new strain.

1262
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,480
And then there's new this and then people got it twice.

1263
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
Some people got the same strain twice.

1264
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:49,400
So it seems to me that fact undermines certain people's confidence that that was either the

1265
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,640
right vaccine or an appropriate vaccine or whether people even knew what they were talking

1266
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
about.

1267
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,559
We all know people who had COVID three, four times.

1268
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:01,000
I was no vid until like three months ago, I would say.

1269
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah.

1270
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,199
And this is a misalignment of expectations versus reality.

1271
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:10,719
We know looking at other coronaviruses because there are seasonal coronaviruses that mostly

1272
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,440
now cause the common cold.

1273
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,360
People get re-infected all the time.

1274
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,920
And so there's every reason to expect with a new coronavirus, you have immunity now.

1275
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,360
That doesn't totally preclude you from infection later.

1276
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Yeah, but if I had smallpox, I expect no smallpox.

1277
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
Right.

1278
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,719
And so there's huge variability across different pathogens.

1279
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:30,159
Nobody told us that when the vaccine came out.

1280
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:31,159
Exactly.

1281
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:33,079
A short falling of communication.

1282
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:34,079
Right.

1283
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,920
Did they know that that was something they could have communicated at the time?

1284
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,159
Or was it still on the frontier of learning of the progress of the novelty of the virus?

1285
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:43,159
There's a big part of that too.

1286
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,279
Is being honest and we don't know for sure yet.

1287
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,879
This is a new virus.

1288
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:51,239
Right now, if you get the vaccine, you're not going to get infected or it's a 95% reduction

1289
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:52,839
in risk.

1290
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,960
Or your risk of severe disease is reduced by 90%.

1291
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,199
But how that will change three years from now, you can't be totally certain.

1292
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,359
If they knew that, they needed to be honest about it, I think.

1293
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,799
Because that's how science works.

1294
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:08,719
You know what you know at any given time and you give the best available information.

1295
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,960
So we want everyone to watch your postings.

1296
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Dr. Knock.

1297
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
That's right.

1298
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Dr. Knock.

1299
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
That's right.

1300
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
DR.noc.

1301
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
And that's on TikTok.

1302
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,399
Are you called that also on Instagram?

1303
00:51:22,399 --> 00:51:23,399
TikTok Instagram.

1304
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:24,399
Yep.

1305
00:51:24,399 --> 00:51:25,399
Same name.

1306
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:26,399
Excellent.

1307
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,119
So we're gonna start off with viewers that that should be 20 million viewers, I think.

1308
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,880
Even more than that.

1309
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,880
We need it.

1310
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,880
We need 330 million viewers.

1311
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,880
That's it.

1312
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,880
That's the only way to come on.

1313
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,880
The whole country.

1314
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,880
The whole country.

1315
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
It.

1316
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
It.

1317
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,880
Thanks for coming down.

1318
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
For those.

1319
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Really appreciate the invitation.

1320
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
Come to the discussion.

1321
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,280
Live into my office and it's good to know you're in arms reach up there in Boston.

1322
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,519
Brookline is your town.

1323
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:50,519
That's right.

1324
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:51,519
That's right.

1325
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:52,519
Right across the Charles River.

1326
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:53,519
Why don't you just give the man a dress.

1327
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:54,519
Sorry.

1328
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,519
Sorry.

1329
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,519
Sorry.

1330
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:01,519
I wear a disguise at all times outside of the recording studio.

1331
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,519
So you'll never notice me.

1332
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,519
All right.

1333
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,360
Well, we come back.

1334
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:12,199
Scott Hamilton Kennedy will tell us about his film, his documentary, Shot in the Arm.

1335
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:18,480
On the subject of medical misinformation, we can't call that topic complete without

1336
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,480
venturing into the world of vaccine hesitancy.

1337
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,840
Vaccines in general.

1338
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,719
And there's one person who's at the front of that conversation.

1339
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,719
And it's my friend, Scott Hamilton Kennedy.

1340
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:32,719
Scott, welcome to the start talk.

1341
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:33,719
Good to see you, Neil.

1342
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:34,719
Hey, dude.

1343
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:35,719
You're a filmmaker.

1344
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,719
I have a filmmaker.

1345
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:37,719
Storyteller.

1346
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:38,719
A documentary filmmaker.

1347
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:39,719
Storyteller.

1348
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,719
Because not all documentaries tell stories.

1349
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:42,719
They try.

1350
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:43,719
Just informational.

1351
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,240
They can be a little laundry-listy.

1352
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Yeah.

1353
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
When you're a laundry-list, it's less compelling, I find.

1354
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,239
I agree.

1355
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:50,239
I agree.

1356
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:56,519
Because you know deeply, I'm guessing, that people love to have stories told to them.

1357
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:57,519
And why?

1358
00:52:57,519 --> 00:52:58,519
Yeah.

1359
00:52:58,519 --> 00:52:59,519
What's the origin of that?

1360
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,519
I would say you've all heard.

1361
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,559
He said it so beautifully in his book, Sapiens, that he said that storytelling is the best

1362
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,879
tool we have available to us as human beings to get along, to agree to change things.

1363
00:53:10,879 --> 00:53:13,479
He really put it into such an amazing context.

1364
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,760
It is the art of storytelling that we can use to convince each other to make this world

1365
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,280
a more functioning place.

1366
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,000
So you made a film called Shot in the Arm, which I actually had something to do with.

1367
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You did.

1368
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,840
You invited me as a script consultant, not that I am an expert on vaccines, but that I do

1369
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:38,079
think deeply about how people learn science and what may convince them one way or another.

1370
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,719
So thank you for inviting me.

1371
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,199
I would call you my mentor, sir.

1372
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:42,199
Oh, good.

1373
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:46,279
So where did that film come from in your head?

1374
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:47,279
Yeah.

1375
00:53:47,279 --> 00:53:49,519
So I'll go all the way back to 2018.

1376
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,359
I was talking to a wonderful doctor, Dr. John Swartz.

1377
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,639
The barbers has invented in 2018, yeah.

1378
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:59,879
In 2018, well, you know Dr. John Swartzberg, because we got to do another film together called

1379
00:53:59,879 --> 00:54:00,879
Food Evolution.

1380
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:04,039
That was a reset of the conversation on GMOs.

1381
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,159
And Dr. John Swartzberg runs the Berkeley Wellness Letter, this fantastic letter out of

1382
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,920
Cal Berkeley that has doctors vet scientific information and then bring it back to the

1383
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
public in a consumable way.

1384
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,920
Not to somewhere.

1385
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,799
What do you say doctors vet the scientific information?

1386
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:21,599
It means they read the journals and they read journal information to the people.

1387
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,599
That's right.

1388
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:23,599
So the people don't have to read the journals.

1389
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,599
That's right.

1390
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,599
They're interpreted.

1391
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,599
It's wonderful.

1392
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,399
It's such a simple, beautiful and very much of your world, too, right?

1393
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,480
You're a wonderful translator in a way of complicated science.

1394
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,359
And he said to me, Scott, what's your next move going to be on?

1395
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,119
You should take on these anti-vaxxers.

1396
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,159
Fall 2018.

1397
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,839
And in my wisdom, I said, oh no, why would I need to touch them?

1398
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:44,839
They're going to go away.

1399
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:45,839
They're going to burn out.

1400
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:52,599
Genius is always cut to spring 2019, record-breaking measles outbreak, a state of emergency here in

1401
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:55,480
New York City in the Orthodox Jewish community, measles.

1402
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Measles outbreak.

1403
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,000
After it had been declared defeated.

1404
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,279
We were on the road to eliminating it in 2000.

1405
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:03,279
We were in the world health organization.

1406
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:04,279
That's right.

1407
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,279
That's right.

1408
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:08,079
That's my lazy research I did when this, when I saw the,

1409
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,599
the state of emergency in New York City as I did a little research.

1410
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,880
I saw that we were about to eliminate it in 2000.

1411
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,639
So what the heck is going on here?

1412
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,519
Why would we have a state of emergency if we're so close?

1413
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,279
And I called Dr. Paul Offit, who's a big part of the upshot in the arm.

1414
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,519
And he said, Scott, it's not very complicated, but it isn't a farious.

1415
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:30,239
There are people out there that have become to be known as anti-vaxxers who scare and convince

1416
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,079
parents to not vaccinate their children.

1417
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,319
And there's, it's never a matter of if it's going to be a matter of when, if you do

1418
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,360
lower those vaccine, right, that you're going to see a measles outbreak.

1419
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,519
And measles has some among viruses, some like unique, not of a unique, but it's, it's

1420
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:46,519
highly contagious.

1421
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,519
Highly contagious.

1422
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,000
It can stay in a room.

1423
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,559
I think it's two hours after.

1424
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,160
So it's floating in the air.

1425
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Floating in the air.

1426
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Yeah.

1427
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,760
That, it's that contagious.

1428
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,880
So that I thought was enough to begin a movie.

1429
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,680
And so I began this movie in 2019.

1430
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,080
My first day shooting was at the CDC's ASIP meetings where they confirm the next

1431
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,559
vaccines that are coming out.

1432
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,059
And I'd pull off it there and I had one of the top anti-vaxxers there, Dell Big Tree, who

1433
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:15,960
went on to be, it's a dear friend of Robert Kennedy Juniors, went on to be Robert Kennedy

1434
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,679
Juniors, communications director during his presidential run.

1435
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,119
But we'll come back to that.

1436
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,679
And I also filmed with Andrew Wakefield, a doctor who had his actually licensed taken

1437
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,920
away when his study was found to be, that it was fraudulent and incorrect and trying to

1438
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,599
make a connection between autism and the MMR, measles, mumps, and rebella vaccine.

1439
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,280
So we thought we had a pretty important movie in all those elements and then COVID happened.

1440
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,360
And it went to another place where we had to film from lockdown.

1441
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,079
I included my family a little bit as like the all of us.

1442
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,440
And for a minute we thought the anti-smit, God forbid, go away when you have a once-in-a-century

1443
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,119
pandemic, but they got stronger and more nefarious.

1444
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,880
How does someone judge in your cinematic world, whether or not your film is propaganda?

1445
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
Great.

1446
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,880
Vetted, right?

1447
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Vetted.

1448
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,359
Yeah, look at the experts that I have in the film.

1449
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,880
Look at the scientific studies that we point out in the film.

1450
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,759
We put them right up on the screen.

1451
00:57:15,759 --> 00:57:17,359
We add them on our website and all those.

1452
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,719
And I will add the experts you do interview, they're not saying, listen to me because I alone

1453
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:22,719
have this one answer.

1454
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:23,719
Correct.

1455
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:27,199
They are representing a scientific medical establishment.

1456
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:28,039
Correct.

1457
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:34,000
You can, and at some point we have to reclaim the importance of the word establishment.

1458
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah.

1459
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's become a bad word.

1460
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Are you from the establishment?

1461
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That's right.

1462
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh, that's bad.

1463
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah.

1464
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,159
No, there's a reason why an establishment exists.

1465
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:47,400
That, yeah, it's, the level of cynicism is very, very depressing.

1466
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,840
But back to your point, your question about the film, that the film don't take my word

1467
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,599
for it, don't take the fact that I have the wonderful Neil deGrasse Tyson as my executive

1468
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,639
producer, which is a great honor and should make them say, hey, if Neil vetted it, that

1469
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:01,639
should mean something.

1470
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:02,639
That's fine.

1471
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,400
But vet the film and vet the words coming out of the people we refer to as antis in the

1472
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
film.

1473
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,279
It is true that most propaganda films don't invite you to vet it.

1474
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:13,679
That's right.

1475
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:16,599
But again, that goes back to my, I'm trying to wrap it up.

1476
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:22,099
But the tools that we could have on Star Talks website, on Black Valley Films website,

1477
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,099
on shot in the arms website.

1478
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,599
Black Valley Films is your production.

1479
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,799
My production, we thank you, is that says, here are the tools we use for vetting.

1480
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:29,799
Right?

1481
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,799
They're right there.

1482
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,799
Here are the tools we use for vetting.

1483
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,799
And it's transparent.

1484
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,799
So it needs to be more of that.

1485
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:36,199
And say, hey, you trying to poke a hole in me?

1486
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:37,799
Do you have those tools on your website?

1487
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:38,799
Yeah.

1488
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,799
Right?

1489
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:43,639
So that empowers people to verify in some way or another.

1490
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:48,839
So Scott, what is your film shot in the arm have to say about our responsibility to each

1491
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:49,839
other?

1492
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,440
Because that seems to be deeper than just any conversation about medicine.

1493
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,840
It's a social contract.

1494
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
Contract.

1495
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
Tell me about that.

1496
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Yeah.

1497
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:08,079
It's a great point that this social contract became part of the film through a few different

1498
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,760
characters in the film that reminded me of it.

1499
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,280
I don't remember the last time I probably talked about it outside of making this film.

1500
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,320
Was it in grade school or something?

1501
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
So the six class?

1502
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
Yeah.

1503
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,080
The whole definition of the social contractor are these norms that are written or sometimes

1504
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,400
not written that have become norms.

1505
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,920
Don't drink and drive.

1506
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Take out your trash.

1507
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
Be a decent neighbor.

1508
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,800
Be a good citizen in your community.

1509
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,800
Don't harm your children.

1510
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,800
Feed your children.

1511
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,800
All these different things.

1512
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,400
And vaccines could be, is part of that, right?

1513
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,000
That you don't necessarily get a vaccine.

1514
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,840
You do get a vaccine to keep yourself safe.

1515
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,640
But sometimes you don't get a vaccine necessary for you to stay safe.

1516
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,640
You get a vaccine.

1517
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,120
So you don't pass something on to somebody who's more vulnerable than you.

1518
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,239
And sadly during COVID we saw, it was building up long before COVID, but during COVID we really

1519
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:58,319
saw kind of a bit of a disaster around our social contract that people leaned into what

1520
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,480
they would call freedom, but it's really a version of selfishness.

1521
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,239
I'm sorry to say it's a tough word.

1522
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:04,239
But.

1523
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:10,960
So you explored in the film that the original sort of anti-vaxxers was a community deeply

1524
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,599
embedded in liberal voting factions.

1525
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:24,719
And only under COVID was there a right-leaning faction that were not so much anti-farmer, which

1526
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,880
is the common battle cry in the left, but they were just pro-freedom.

1527
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,519
And so their notion was, you can't inject me if I don't want you to.

1528
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:36,519
That's right.

1529
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:41,960
So why don't we just still allow that, but then deny them access to places where they

1530
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,279
could spread the disease?

1531
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,480
Or we could give them their own island?

1532
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,560
It's terribly cynical and maybe even mean.

1533
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,440
But if we had an island, all these people say, I want my freedoms.

1534
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,000
Don't tell me what drugs to take.

1535
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Don't touch my food.

1536
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,040
I don't want my milk to be pasteurized.

1537
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,800
I don't want fluoride in my water.

1538
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,800
Okay, fine.

1539
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,920
Here's the island.

1540
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,240
You guys go start over again.

1541
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,960
I think somebody may have written a book that may have touched on this.

1542
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,280
But not everything in that list is equal.

1543
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,160
Of course.

1544
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,560
For example, if your water supply, your personal water supply, you remove the fluoride.

1545
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Right.

1546
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,920
No one else is affected by that.

1547
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
True.

1548
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,920
But if you are not vaccinated and you catch the disease and you infect others, then they

1549
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
are affected.

1550
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,920
Correct.

1551
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,920
Okay.

1552
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,480
So not all the reasons why you might ship people to this island are equivalent.

1553
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,480
No.

1554
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,480
I just want to ship them ones on all right.

1555
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,880
I didn't say that this was, I didn't say this was a kind decision, Neil.

1556
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,800
This is a frustrated decision.

1557
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
Okay.

1558
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,840
So there's been a frustration on the civics front.

1559
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,240
And that's what you're really getting at.

1560
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,680
An individual for individual front that we do remember that there's a thing called

1561
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,680
the social contract.

1562
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Do we want cars?

1563
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,760
No, I never wondered about it that way.

1564
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,960
But in fifth grade, I did have civics class.

1565
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,320
I don't think I even had civics class.

1566
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Yeah, I had a civics class.

1567
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,119
I had a button called you were in the civics club.

1568
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,800
And I might still have that button actually.

1569
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,160
And we did things like we held elections and campaigning.

1570
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:15,480
People ran for president of the class and things that were microcosms of the larger

1571
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
society.

1572
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,879
We didn't pretend someone had been vaccinated or had a disease.

1573
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:23,440
But it forced you to think about other people.

1574
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,839
That's it.

1575
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:29,079
And maybe that was undervalued in the kindergarten through 12 curriculum.

1576
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:34,719
It might be another one of those things that we took for granted in a bad way that we

1577
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,599
took for granted that we have these systems.

1578
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,359
And maybe our kinder people and our family were making those systems work.

1579
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,759
If it was our grandparents who were teaching us to be to polite or one of the different

1580
01:02:44,759 --> 01:02:45,759
things.

1581
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,759
Right.

1582
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,159
So how do we fix it?

1583
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:50,959
Again, these are not quickly.

1584
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:52,879
Start there, not quickly.

1585
01:02:52,879 --> 01:02:55,639
The quick part would be to say, is there a problem?

1586
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,959
I might make a comparison to alcohol and addiction.

1587
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:01,959
Right?

1588
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,800
We probably all have some family member that has been addicted to something like alcohol

1589
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,240
or a drug.

1590
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,079
And we wanted to help them.

1591
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,079
And we might want to say stop.

1592
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:12,559
It's not going to work.

1593
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,320
What's the first step that's going to get them to actually go down the road admitting their

1594
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
addiction?

1595
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,400
So I think we're learning through a time where people are not in the place to admit that

1596
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,240
they might have a problem about being cynical about science.

1597
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,800
They might have a problem about humility.

1598
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,039
They might have a problem with their relationship to the social contract.

1599
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:35,800
And we have to admit that problem.

1600
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,400
Yeah, but if you're an alcoholic, you might go into therapy.

1601
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,880
Do you go into therapy if you're not admitting that science matters in your life?

1602
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,080
But usually you don't go to therapy unless you've until you've admitted it.

1603
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,480
You don't go to dry out.

1604
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,480
No occasion.

1605
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,480
You don't, yeah, you might have an intervention.

1606
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,800
But besides the intervention, the first step has to be, and it's still even within

1607
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
intervention.

1608
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,519
They can leave the drug rehab place, right?

1609
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,119
They have to admit that they have a problem.

1610
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:07,880
So can we as a society admit that we have a problem about cynicism, that we have a problem

1611
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,920
about selfishness, that we have a problem about what is expertise and who we should be listening

1612
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
to?

1613
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,920
That I think is...

1614
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,759
Yeah, but you're the filmmaker and there's nothing more influential in American society

1615
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:21,039
than a well-made film that everyone sees and is deeply affecting them.

1616
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,800
Did you just take us in a time machine prior to social media?

1617
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
Yeah.

1618
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,800
I would agree with that statement except for our love films they've been in.

1619
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,360
You know, after the movie Ghost with, you know, Wippie Goldberg and...

1620
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,360
Demi Moore.

1621
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,360
And Demi Moore.

1622
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,920
After that film, polls on people's belief in Ghost went up.

1623
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,920
There you go.

1624
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,680
Just because of the film.

1625
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,920
That somehow made it more real because it was a story well told.

1626
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Without question.

1627
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,240
So I'm just a scientist and you are the storyteller.

1628
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,120
You're the time-honored storyteller who's craft predates science.

1629
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,120
Nice.

1630
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
Beautiful.

1631
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,720
The storyteller predates science.

1632
01:04:58,719 --> 01:04:59,719
Yes.

1633
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,799
And I am an independent documentary filmmaker.

1634
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:08,439
So that's documentary filmmaker and independent means that I'm a little bit on the outside.

1635
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:13,759
What do you do if someone notices in your funding stream that you get money from like the

1636
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:14,759
enemy?

1637
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:18,319
You get money from karma and you're trying to say that the farmer is good.

1638
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,319
Sure.

1639
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:24,599
I do everything in my power to not take money from a conflict of interest in the making

1640
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,119
of the film, in the distribution of the film.

1641
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,759
I don't care who gives her money because I finish the film and it's locked and it's

1642
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:33,759
has been influenced.

1643
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:38,239
But that's another just because there is a possible conflict of interest.

1644
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,079
It doesn't mean there is a conflict of interest.

1645
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:43,079
People have come to assume it.

1646
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:44,079
That's right.

1647
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:49,839
So Scott, we previously collaborated on a film, Food Evolution, which explored misinformation

1648
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:55,559
regarding genetically modified organisms, GMOs.

1649
01:05:56,279 --> 01:06:02,719
In both of these films, you're exploring things that in the left-leaning community, some

1650
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:09,880
of them are whole sacred and you are dismantling some of their beliefs within this.

1651
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,440
And you had a phrase and I never remembered exactly what was it.

1652
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,559
The limitation of well-intentioned liberals.

1653
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:19,039
The limitations of well-intentioned liberals.

1654
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,199
Where it's an idea that wants to be, they want to promote, then they overstep in what they

1655
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,879
think is true regarding the idea.

1656
01:06:27,879 --> 01:06:28,879
That's right.

1657
01:06:28,879 --> 01:06:31,000
But they think they're right.

1658
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,559
But a confirmation bias, rabbit hole.

1659
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:34,559
Okay.

1660
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,480
And so this has been your thing.

1661
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,480
It's a piece of the pie.

1662
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,000
It was different prior to COVID because then everything blew up and there was all sorts

1663
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,839
of people with their limitations of good intentions.

1664
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:54,239
But yes, as a born and raised die-hard liberal, I came to question my liberal brothers and

1665
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,599
sisters through that lens.

1666
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:59,559
But it isn't just good intentions are not enough.

1667
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:03,279
You've got to have data, you have to have evidence, you have to have repeatability, you have

1668
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:04,959
to check yourself every so often.

1669
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:05,959
So yes, it's a...

1670
01:07:05,959 --> 01:07:13,719
You my point was, often the liberal left will declare that the conservative right is anti-science.

1671
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:14,719
Right.

1672
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:19,599
And they'll cite very obvious examples such as denial of climate change and in some cases

1673
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,079
denial of evolution.

1674
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:25,199
The statement is made as though they're up on high.

1675
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:26,199
Looking down.

1676
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:27,199
Looking down.

1677
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:32,719
Whereas you part the curtains in the liberal community, you get things like homeopathic medicines,

1678
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:37,159
you get crystal healing, feather energy, you get these things.

1679
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:45,239
The only way you can embrace these ideas and philosophies is to reject the science that

1680
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:50,360
either comes from part or all of mainstream science that denies it.

1681
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,039
That's right.

1682
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:56,360
And so that puts you in a weird place as a storyteller.

1683
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,360
You did a beautiful thing on the poster for Food Evolution and you sign it saying to

1684
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,680
Scott, who's not afraid of what is true.

1685
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,680
Did I say that?

1686
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
Yeah, okay.

1687
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
I may have forged it.

1688
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,680
No.

1689
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
Yeah.

1690
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,680
And I thought it was such a...

1691
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,039
It took me a little while actually, Neil, to come back to and go, oh, that's what

1692
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:11,039
that means.

1693
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,039
Yeah.

1694
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:13,039
Because I'm not afraid of what is true.

1695
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,039
Right.

1696
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:15,039
I'm afraid of what's been manipulated.

1697
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,039
Yeah.

1698
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:17,039
It's a group think thing that...

1699
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,039
Yeah.

1700
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:20,039
Or somebody lying to me, right?

1701
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:21,039
Right.

1702
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:22,439
Somebody tells me the truth.

1703
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,159
I'm going to deal with the truth.

1704
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,479
Somebody tells me something that's...

1705
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,479
Can you handle the truth?

1706
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,479
That's right.

1707
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,680
Somebody tells me something that's scary and it's not true.

1708
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,680
Oh my God.

1709
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,680
It's a disaster.

1710
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Right?

1711
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,039
The truth is complicated enough.

1712
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:38,760
But to go, to get back to like why I joked earlier about could we have a beeper on our

1713
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,359
phone that says, full of shit, full of shit, full of shit.

1714
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,359
Right?

1715
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,359
Yeah.

1716
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,359
Any of us, again, not political.

1717
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,359
It's a bio-solar.

1718
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,359
It's a bio-solar.

1719
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,359
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

1720
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,359
Absolutely.

1721
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,439
Or God forbid we seize like an engine and I can't talk anymore.

1722
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,199
I'm so full of shit my body stops functioning.

1723
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,199
Not me anyone.

1724
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:01,799
We say seize like an engine you're referring to an internal combustion engine.

1725
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:02,799
Thank you very much.

1726
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:03,920
Because electric engines don't seize.

1727
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,319
Are there electric engines out there?

1728
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,319
It's kidding.

1729
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,319
Yes.

1730
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,319
Thank you.

1731
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,319
I was going to old school.

1732
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,319
All right.

1733
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,079
So thanks Scott for doing this little bit of conversation.

1734
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:14,759
Exposing you to our loyal audiences.

1735
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:15,759
Love this event.

1736
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,400
And we're all here to try to make a better world using science as the tool.

1737
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,039
And now we have to include storytellers as part of that tool.

1738
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,360
I really appreciate it.

1739
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,360
All right.

1740
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,119
This has been Stark Talks Special Edition.

1741
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:33,840
I want to thank Dr. Nock and Scott Hamilton Kennedy for coming in for this recording.

1742
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,680
Neil deGrasse Tyson here as always bidding you to keep looking up.
