could extra dimension exist
would try probe
whether thats case imagine
looking extended object like
wire look onedimensional
look like length
able get really close
wire youd see also
something like thickness
extra direction whats called
compact possible
compactified time dimension well oh
wow yeah imagine two dimension
time wow problem two time
dimensional theory compact time
dimension general
hard maintain causality higher
dimension look u thats
star talk neil degrasse tyson
personal astrophysicist got chuck nice
chuck hey im
great man thanks right
comedian actor yeah seen tv
commercial yeah
know im uh listen sometimes
nothing okay
well today got really cool topic
thats always everybodys mind well
everybody care universe
know even people dont
ill get ill get later yeah
know talking ive
heard really weird stuff
people know want get
yeah right right
talking today string theory
yeah man town
string theorist brian green right
street right said know
universe brian green
know would beg differ said
reached cosmos
right found laura anderson
laura welcome star talk thank
much pleasure
yeah associate professor
physic virginia tech one
producer virginia tech
youre right home among u
yeah youre family yeah youre
family good among friend also
like brian green double
affiliation also mathematics
department im affiliate
professor mathematics mean
supervise math grad student
well youre taking
job everybody professor
street laura anderson
try picture
theyre like ill ill math
homework money exactly
math food think
unfortunately job called
tutor really really exactly uh
research includes
geometry particle phenomenology
string theory want let
get bottom
string theory yes string theory
attempt reconcile einstein theory
general relativity theory
gravity formalism quantum
mechanic quantum field theory
consistent quantum theory
gravity um may way
quantum gravity work universe
least
theoretical playground get
ask question quantum gravity
youve made assumption
agree assumption
want hear defend
trying absorb einstein general
theory relativity modern
understanding gravity right
quantum description arent
trying take quantum absorb
general relativity description
inherent
said must inongruency
would cause
exactly dont start
law inongruency
youre trying resolve two
greatest intellectual
accomplishment 20th century
opinion einstein theory
gravity description
fundamental interaction nature um
described particle physic thing
like uh description know quirk
fundamental particle interact
give u
description thing like
electromagnetism strong weak
nuclear force sort basic
building block matter
fundamental lego hook
together theyre described well
quantum field theory issue
sort discrepancy
two separately able
make prediction incredibly
accurate modern world
make prediction like 13 significant
figure using either
theoretical framework 13
decimal place right 13 significant
figure yeah im going say thats
pretty accurate pretty great
yeah like thing like modern gps
wouldnt work without general
relativity lot way
testing theory seem really
robust theyre telling u
really important thing
world behaves unfortunately try
combine two try
describe phenomenon might need
tool example thing
interaction particle short
distance scale play also
there really strong gravitation
example inside black hole um
would regime need
theory
framework agree give
concrete prediction unfortunately
theory break try
combine dont end
getting useful answer get
manifestly wrong answer theyre called
disastrous infinity um thing
dont predict anything
disastrous infinity man cant
get dis sound like
worst marriage ever yeah
great disastrous infinity
give confidence
quantum physic understanding
absorb gravity gravity
absorbing quantum physic great
question think
twoway street um order
describe either phenomenon need
something described
framework einstein theory sort
intrinsically classical um meaning
picture curvature space
time designed sort
quantum mechanical uncertainty
know observe particle
physic sense know
einstein theory probably granular
level sort zoom
evolve something quantum
mechanical um exact form
exploration okay okay
work mentioned
fundamental particle go back
ancient greece atom
fundamental particle
smallest thing could
could right break
atom oh there particle
listed like electron thats
fundamental mentioned quark
give confidence
cant keep dividing cutting
yeah thats great question
dont think think theoretical
physicist would say
100 confident stop
zoo particle weve
observed far seem match
phenomenon force interaction
effect see nature
well absolutely could
smaller thing play indeed string
theory posit okay oh
really right exactly thats
little vibrating string
fundamental string fundamental
take u take u
string come
idea behind string theory
know twominute version
string theory try say
imagine instead describing
particle little point particle
move space imagine instead
able zoom far enough
could object
extended length associated
rough idea
like violin string vibrate
different way produce different
note little fundamental string
vibrate different
configuration turn
change property um
mathematics describe
thing moving change
property based vibrate
vibrate one way
electron vibrate another way
quark um seems like
sort cute idea
describe lot physic
simple framework thats
thats case principle ought
able pluck string
otherwise electron get quark
done
problem im gonna tell
one thing thats really cool
framework also two thing
cool one
much said
um cant test observe
know string
theory predicts fundamental
length scale string small
would need particle
accelerator size solar
system order smash atom together
directly see string um
unfortunately access
type energy scale yet
affirm implicit
statement larger particle
accelerator faster speed
particle collide
there much energy
collision youll probe regime
previous accelerator could thats
right okay scale
got going need
something size solar system
get energy right
doesnt seem viable
whats whats plan b yeah
answer let let
throw one thing string
theory think important say
ask quantum mechanical
point particle say kind
space could move turn
quantum field theory quantum
mechanic formulated type
space move
basically background
choose know configuration
space time ask
question uh little
onedimensional string say
quantum mechanical string move
turn space
theyre allowed move
thing vibrating different
way different particle
space
space obey einstein equation
general relativity sound good
wow yeah actually get gravity
free formulation quantum
mechanical string sometimes
say quantum gravity consistent
also compulsory string theory
know youre
forced equation
string may satisfy thats good
feeling mean something
talking something else form
formulation right
crowbarred begin
thats right sort
handed fact think
something early development
string theory got lot people
excited unfortunately like many good
thing uh thing come catch
catch string theory
beautiful formulation described
know describe
particle physic one little extended
object get gravity free
seems work universe
happens three spatial
dimension one timelike dimension
seem see universe
need extra dimension right
live four dimension
three spatial plus time need
dimension order make thing
work dont access
dimension cant really say
sure well mean seems like
really big intellectual leap right
pretty happy three
dimension space one dimension
time first pas like could
dealbreaker
right way could
consistent weve already
observed universe
alluding right
question know could extra
dimension exist would
try probe whether thats
case um requirement
see right bat extra
dimension exist
cant size rest
dimension see
universe look around
see know large
spatial extent know front
back side side
course time
direction would
really really small compared
rest universe analog
imagine looking
extended object like wire really
far away look onedimensional
look like length
able get really close
wire youd see also
something like thickness radial
direction extra direction
whats called compact um meaning
small compared say
length wire one thing
know
chance working extra
dimension would compact
small compared rest
universe okay youre freaking
right mean im
going say
costa rica iawaska week
time experience
met being told
dimension existed
inside dimension
alongside yet inside dimension
live think
maybe presupposed
preplanted posthypnotic suggestion
actually read
string theory
drug taking
get followup question
thats right
hear question yeah
possible compactified time
dimension well
model stuck one time
dimension oh wow never even
considered yeah imagine two
dimension time wow holy crap go
ahead yes problem two time
dimensional theory compact time
dimension general
hard maintain causality
theory time
direction loop back
possible whole go back
time shoot grandpa situation
hitting pretty hard maintain
consistent theory multiple time
direction compact time
direction im going
say impossible people
dont consider viable way
forward would discard
causality altogether order
think general claim would
would violate causality
theory um may
creative way get around
generically think thats true
way stephen hawking one
earlier episode find
archive went
university cambridge chilled
bit tell proposed
time travel conjecture something like
tell u
save u mean
number conjecture say
theory gravity say
um causality important
structure um general one
would expect consistent
theory gravity indeed quantum
mechanic allow
cant get work okay okay
thats fine mean yeah mean listen
remove many movie
repertoire got go back
change past exactly like
terminator terminator done
forget look back
past look forward many
future idea able
look back say particular
point many future still exist
could get back point
could change one
track know mean
great fantasy make sense
fantasy youre saying
stupid fantasy cuz aint never
going happen well would say
know never say never insight
got careful um certainly
something think people
good idea make work
consistent way moment thats
im scientist
consider say never say never
said never said never
said never cant say never say
never unless youre saying never hey
star talk fan dont know know
audio version
podcast actually post week advance
video version get
spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk sort
pivot whole thing
phenomenology cuz want know
big word lot syllable ive
heard invoked especially
particle physic step
want understand
ever test string theory
know advance naysayer
uh physicist among
saying youre diverting time
resource graduate student faculty
position something doesnt even
classify legitimate scientific
theory hypothesis need
able test without test
go home let hear response
absolutely think thats
really fair question um know
theoretical framework youre
trying describe thing there
big intellectual leap right
example extra dimension pretty big
leap um justify
payoff right say
benefit im going give
term know structure
prediction know youre
learning theory push
back know going
test um let observe first
uh particle theory general time
scale predicting structure
particle theory able
see experiment last half
century gone know increased
size considerably one example
prediction higs bzon
made peter higs took 50
year prediction
particle exist observation
lhc mean theorist
way ahead experimentalist
got deadbeat experimentalists
would say
would say dialogue theory
experiment really important
im pointing direct
experiment know direct
verification experiment lot
thing hard doesnt mean
one shouldnt mean
know deciding
time scale relevant
question um string theory would
say problem lot worse
something like prediction
higs boson energy scale
massive directly uh observe
string personally im
interested trying decide whether
string theory useful lot faster
point view
career remain agnostic
whether thats case want
alive want alive
decide also know
somebody could could demonstrate
right string theory
sure useful universe id
choose work something else
think sort
direct way type answer
string theory many type
structure result physic
really intercorrelated turn
something like um
particle physic description
particle know far
standard model particle physic
thats organization
particle know one one
chart say interacts
connects
beautiful thing actually
step back tri mean
happened im older
yall happened lifetime
basically 1970s started
assembling little earlier
full picture coming together
found particle flesh
periodic table
particle okay right organiz
organizing principle good okay
pick sorry quick
anecdote kid got
interested physic reading book like
people like brian green
know early teen
little um id written standard
model like piece paper made
little zoo particle like
carried around piece paper
bit super know nerdy young
young person girl geek house
love girl geek alert yeah totally
totally um totally agree
zoo know
point going
make relation string theory
something like standard
model there lot free number
example nothing theory
tell mass electron
quark couple
number observed
universe well said free
number mean predicted
correct predicted structure
theory contrast
string theory found
solution string theory produced
particle physic like see
universe none number
free theyre determined
configuration extra dimension
structure theory
huge array physic
get right
ive talking particle
physic also answer
question cosmology large
scale structure history
universe going
decide string theory wrong
think likely
would able say structure
see nature argue
either cant get right
sort regime number effect
already know um much
rapidly going build
accelerator see string love
oh thats yeah yeah
youre saying whether
test dimensionality
sort physicality string
theory could theorist
go back room come
say pluck string way
going give electron
going give mass right
mass thats going
come right cuz thats
right number thats right number
right vibration going
look like electron
thats nobel prize right yeah
like like way
like modeling weather modeling
prediction run
model whats already done
get number
confidence predictive model
thats right idea
articulated
around like 40 year um
people first formulating
string theory everybody excited
thought going exactly
said know youre
going go around youre going look
solution string theory
youre going say boom here
universe here number
predict everything great
hasnt happened uh there
know people still trying think
big
obstacle one issue
turn ask many
different configuration extra
dimension um initially
hope maybe
restrictive maybe
couple um question many
could said
um say two extra dimension
uh obeyed consistency equation
string theory turn there
unique answer differential
equation tell shape
could ask know
happens four extra
dimension there unique answer
say happens
six extra dimension happens
extra dimension think
need arise give see
nature turn half
billion configuration counting
found far sound
like guy saying
instrument
instrument there certain amount
note resonant
instrument figure
one song
note make however
many billion song
got find one song
note play also sound
like nature messing u
sound one
thing people push back string
theory say okay
possible solution string theory
exist ever going
predicted know could
big soup thing
people even made argument
call string landscape
say know could land
anywhere there
place string landscape look
like universe there
junk theory actually
telling u argument
would would say
something like quantum field theory
already talked
standard model zoo
know quirk lepttons
know nature infinite
number quantum field theory
could write arent
universe doesnt matter
know write one
look like universe string
theory sort natural extension
quantum field theory way
lot flexibility may
nothing physic
observe universe
question zoom
part theory learn
anything example find
see particle
already know additional particle
must additional force
correlate feature cosmology
large scale structure
universe like dark energy dark matter
particle physic know
true dont want lessen
significance describe
understand youre saying
like said landscape
half billion possible song
could want one song
thats useful
find unless upon finding get
insight universe
uhhuh otherwise
story right right
universe
explain doesnt
take street
fair way characterize
yeah another thing people
asking within string theory
many possible quantum theory
gravity could imagine
string theory isnt universe
work know quantum theory
gravity might idealized
describe universe physic
talk know pretending
cow sphere order make
math easier consider spherical cow
oh gotcha time
okay yeah easier
way uh society physic
student spherical cow tshirt
virginia tech yeah yeah
thing thats thats pretty wild
thing want maximize
milk production cow right
start spherical cow start
spherical cow yeah right yeah
dont want milk dont want
dont want milk spherical cow
dont im sorry yeah yeah im going
goat milk yeah yeah
point im making maybe
string theory isnt know
idealized describe quantum
gravity work universe lot
theorist questioning okay
thats case know
quantum theory gravity
another one right like right one
isnt string theory could
two theory related
there group string theorist
trying argue provide
mathematical theorem um example
someone named kerman bafa harvard
created something called coortism
conjecture he positing
perhaps one
quantum theory gravity must
connected way otherwise
would develop inconsistency
could describe quantum gravity quantum
gravitational effect
argument im making even
string theory isnt right one
whatever might mean maybe
connected right one maybe
still learn structure string
theory inform universe
look like
exactly said
comprehensive look
give rise multiverse
infinite number universe thats
different question
interesting one answer
answer okay
well say well say
later specific specialty within
string theory particle phenomenology
could could introduce u
absolutely thats question
whether string theory produce
solution look like particle
physic see standard
model example um
interaction fundamental
force arent gravity one
thing ive worked um
various time career trying
ask type solution
see string theory um
characterizes would give u
thing like see nature um
coming back concept
string landscape um there famous
number like possible solution
get string
landscape number like 10
500 unimaginably large
thrown around 10 500 10
500 thats number thats
number crazy thats even
number counting
solution string theory um
know something
people say oh know 10 500
going learn anything
10 500 people
counted historically none
included electron okay
know something universe
want model dont care there
10 500 yeah none
possibly give rise type
physic see type
research trying
correlate shape extra
dimension property string
theory narrow field
thing close universe
okay gotten yet
whats whats know whats hold
getting better mean
honesty um know
delivered yet feel
like still making legitimate progress
okay uh one
great redeeming quality
scientific discovery search
thereof even dont get
thing trying find along
way find great
stuff give u computer
digital camera gps didnt get
wanted
guy contributed
happy accident well let say
tightly say tighter
ready love go ahead
loved want say another
way right go ahead okay um
failure succeeded
think answer
really big string theory field
really expanded know huge
different number sub field
researcher really different
thing many different
answer question could like
know percolating back
mind one um discovery
holographic principle say uh
phenomenon like gravity deeply
related thing called gauge theory
describe interaction
particle charge um
thing related uh different
dimension space statement
uh gravitational theory
related gauge theory live
quote boundary space um
thing like holographic principle
extremely deep uh bit
structure say know gauge
theory particle physic
gravity different
thought thats thats
really um profound would say
observation arisen string
theory simplest example
ive heard holographic principle
surface event horizon
black hole okay correct
im wrong fall
surface memory everything
passed interesting
think information content
surface full understanding
anything everything thats inside thats
inside there loss
information retained
retained inside black
hole inside black
hole universe
horizon analogize
event horizon would
holographic projection
fair c capture
correctly wow okay given ive
yet heard physicist rebut
general agreement thats
probably real mean idealized
sense yes um much know
pertains uh know learn
universe think still
grab something
people thinking
actively um analogy would
give know useful stuff thats
come string theory um
relationship thing like
particle physic cosmology
know study uh know dark
energy dark matter description
inflation thing related
know particle physic uh
realizes also structure
mathematics
um lot new field
mathematics sparked due
dialogue u mathematician
physicist arose string
theory shape extra
dimension thats good youre
exciting mathematician right yes
reached wanted
department right
sometimes yeah think
know much mutual
relationship youre taking
job away another professor
professor
one example um there
something called minimal model
program uh geometry try
classify basically um
higherdimensional complex shape like
know write
compact geometry number
dimension characterize
property come sort
zoo every possible geometry well
get
specialty algebraic geometry thats
right spinoff rest
interest
much tied question
trying produce particle physic
uh string theory thats thats
particle physic question actual
computation really rest
property compact extra
dimension ton
geometry extract number
want like mass electron
coupling quirk sort
intrinsically interdicciplinary
sense wow want hear
geometry thats mean
thats crazy here something
simple lowdimensional
dont laugh want
take level uh
talking topologist algebra
one math folk
talking knot okay
knot right take string
tie knot knot
square knot whatever
knot whatever knot okay whatever
knot
thats three dimension
onedimensional string
make knot said whats
four spatial dimension said
cant tie knot four dimension
would lift would
un unravel
messed
thought let take away dimension
let go two dimension okay okay
two dimension two
dimensional people flat surface
take rope loop
cannot undo
unsolvable knot
cant pas back come
around right right three
dimension pick
gone right
couldnt sleep night
wondered going
mind someone who imagining
even higher dimension
kind drug hiding
stop come lara dont hold
shared iawaska give u real
dope never told u iawaska
highdimensionality person talk
well know guy
first know honest
freaky freaked
never talked
said string theorist
future said savior
neo string theory neo
yeah matrix neo please
tell u really like
analogy let give another one thats
sort directly related
kind stuff talked
know einstein theory gravity
could ask imagine entire
universe twodimensional right
could curvature could lead
like gravitational like theory
two dimension turn there
one number get
specify basically know
imagine like surface
sphere whether know
positively curved negatively curved
like saddle thats
cant dynamical gravity two
dimension likewise know form
gravitation take change go
dimension absolutely
question know
unnot use describe
space time might curve
change different dimension
yeah get brain
im telling right
im know need nap
conversation
copout thing
higher dimension
compacted dont think
worry ill never see
right impactful
compacted dimension youre
trying manifest gravity higher
dimension gravity care
compacted care
dimensionality
care compact care
compactness care
shape extra dimension
indeed believe string theory
extra dimension still
obey einstein equation still
consistent gravity
extra dimension suppose lived
eight dimension came
general relativity eight dimension
say 3 one
dimensional thing higher dimension
obey
measly 3 1dimensional world cant
put cant put commandment higher
dimension superior u
every way know yes
hate say higher dimension
look u thats
im sorry thats tshirt right
good tshirt
man actually torture
undergraduate student class
einstein theory um einstein
theory actually formulated
number dimension easily
there actually nothing special
four um frequently student
ill say know imagine
six dimension 10 dimension
know said formulated
easily didnt say meant
easily relative statement
one thing isnt easy
actually uh related hard
know really bring string
theory full fruition
einstein theory higher
dimension equation
solve nastier human
really good nonlinear differential
equation um especially
good go high number
variable high number
dimension isnt something
okay dont get math
fluid ai bot mean thats
whole thats whole point
mean yeah exactly hard
give ai yeah one
thing weve try
string theory extract
prediction actually solve
einstein equation extra
compact dimension dont know
analytic solution um
mean know exact solution
could write piece paper um
einstein theory six
dimension would need um
string compactations
theyre called science solve
problem analytically equation
say there answer
cant actually run
experiment increment model
see result time see
go right thats
ugly hate kind
recognize thats like chaos
theory sort calculate
right cant write
solution uh youre
saying cant principle
laborious known
yet um general solving
einstein equation number
dimension know system
hard theyre nonlinear
mean
gravitational theory actually
backreacting talking
fact graviton
know quantum mechanical
description gravity space
create gravity
really wild term differential
equation normally could say
find one solution theory
find another add
together still get solution
general relativity doesnt work
cant add two solution get
another solution start
every time model
astrophysics time
there stuff thats
complicated know instant
whats supposed happen
load load
youre youre calculating
differential equation
equation calculate
every time step following
time step right right
cant solve whole
whole shebang got right
tell cant
use ai actually
thats thats fun topic um
involved number year
numeric simulation like youre
describing use computer
try solve equation
cant otherwise historically
order computation
put supercomputer cluster
like wait month get result um
actually um advent
ai something
collaborator worked
iphone right
actually laptop
um weve started using machine
learning algorithm numerically solve
differential equation
different using like
know looking photo internet
ai generate new photo
dont solution
isnt database train
ai model still use
framework neural network
try solve really complicated
equation indeed um ive worked
lot people
field found using
technique speed lot
computation really substantive
way actually made possible
recently group compute
quark mass string theory
first time clear
quark mass value
actually observe nature um
would awesome dont see
yet say hand
extra dimension whatever may
say would know
quirk look like universe
actually come
number using machine learning
algorithm chuck go back
iawaska trip get person
dimension verify quark quark
mass yeah yeah exactly
chuck oracle physic
im im im telling
right im im ready im ready
go iaska im im ready
let ask another thing talk
discovery come
possible
excites u dont say every
day feel could
could bring forth new
physic till everything
youve said within
framework quantum quantum field
theory general relativity imagine
einstein born would
even know relativity thing
could use solve problem
new physic waiting
emerge either either work
yettobe born genius
youll look say oh gosh im
going give fast astro case
okay uh turn century uh
orbit mercury around sun
wasnt quite following newton law
know like well there
probably another planet tugging
yeah even named planet
mean thats oh really yeah
called vulcan oh nice yeah yeah
go 1910 look planet vulcan
like okay
happy well come one saw
oh cuz close sun
glare
worked
worked einstein come
general relativity wasnt
trying explain showed
strong gravity newton law
fail plug equation
there disagreement thing
vulcan died overnight new
physic
transformed physic already
working gave u better answer
move learned
einstein killed vulcan
tyson killed pluto stop
thats lesson trying
good lesson new
physic could take lot different
form um know one example might
perhaps four
fundamental force weve already
observed nature could
know socalled fifth force uh
another version something like
electromagnetism um know
strong weak nuclear force um would
example new physic uh
thing know dont understand
well include thing like dark
energy dark matter um question
like know general relativity tell
u disastrous
infinity know center
black hole there singularity
actually repair
singularity quantum uh know
gravitational theory tell u
physic really behaves inside
um thats definitely new physic
would hope kind
thing youd like see oh wow
okay think there new physic
claim
know string theory deliver im
im still somewhat agnostic um
think really interesting
try push theory find say
know show
cant used model universe
real possibility
going break somewhere cant get
push try
make structure visible
id love 100 year look
back conversation say look
idiot back 2025 yeah
kindergarten video 100 year
hope
got something else
duality string theory whats going
yeah something
collaborator working
moment thats cool word
way duality love duality duality
idea behind duality
could two different theory two
different geometry arise
compact extra dimension string
theory secretly different side
coin analogy
give sometimes talk ever
looked optical
illusion photo internet
know picture thats
either vase look one way
two face look
way say know vase
face answer
right packaged question
string theory
different know half billion
configuration extra dimension
lead different physic
answer think um
known equivalence different
socalled topological space
thing know different
geometric property like number
hole structure um
different topological space
actually lead physic
would see there
redundancy really
powerful mean dont
search half billion
possibility know maybe
sort fold possibility half
look portion
um duality
around know 20 year string
theory collaborator think
new example uh require uh
less um super symmetry less
spherical cow people assumed
past okay yeah growing
leg cow example um
think may improve ability
calculate lot thing also
teach u new property
mathematically space
behave wait catch u super
symmetry super symmetry something
come along ride um
formulation string theory
say quirk lepttons
see nature may
additional partner um example
instead uh know quark
squirk another partner um would
much heavier existing
particle weve seen
youre describing super symmetry
symmetry beyond symmetry
already known loved standard
model thats right
sort three generation quirk
lepttons weve seen already um
would another whole set
particle would share many
property heavier mass
sort opposite
theory know particle
say bzon would firmionic
partner right
youre saying
youre content three
regime standard model
hand u somewhere universe
regime see
property might
could explain stuff dont
understand thats idea people
initially thought idea might
explain really um important
question particle physic uh
example mass higs
bzon would whats called
lowcale super symmetry particle
experiment like lhc search
hard didnt see
people consider super symmetry
useful idea thought
know might appear
regime would useful um
people reinvestigating question
string theory know
solution string theory super
symmetric um
generally would agree
super symmetry would
high scale would
much um particle would much
heavier could see
experiment like lhc
symmetry would spontaneously broken
universe like
time got know
live would see
standard model particle energy
one would
helped birth
um im going say thats rather
convenient though
im going say
question like need
symmetry right youre kind
getting rid back know
really want talking
physic yeah conveniently discarding
thats great great question um
string theory still play role
term regulating quantum
mechanical behavior theory
making well behaved sense
know youre still using
theoretically something even though
dont need describe
particle physic observing
nature think string
theorist would ask really
interesting question say much
super symmetry get rid
still preserve feature
interest u type
duality describing
perhaps um new involve
less reliance super symmetry
past still
observing sort redundancy
different description
physic packaged different way um
dont need much super symmetry
memory serf graviton
standard model correct
thats right mean one
thinking super symmetric
particle graviton
would kind interesting yeah
certainly could particle um
know gauge bzon could
whats called gino super
symmetric particle gauge eno theyre
making pulling as
yes sound like youre naming like
pharmaceutical product
era physic feel
name much
product 1970s high
school thats old
1970s im know
like particle month club
new particle discovered
new accelerator california
elsewhere uh
building fabric universe
thats kind cool actually
fun witness fun
thats fun yeah participant
witness could expend moment
celebrating idea symmetry
physic yeah really really
great question symmetry physic
um something extremely
deep predictive
powerful last hundred year
physic question
class undergraduate try
convey lot physic
based looking phenomenon
see like apple falling tree
saying know model
path thats going fall right
like write equation
describes start
talking symmetry
uh basically rule might
change space equation way
leave alone start
talking symmetry actually
power ask could theory
im describing different
allows ask question
observe whether
theory write could uh
arisen differently nature there
um kind highulutin quote
einstein know saying wanted
probe god thought um know
term theory sound
extremely grandiose tangible
non theological um underpinning
ask theory
write theory like einstein
theory relativity could
different freedom uh
change theory could
theory gravity
could worked
understanding understanding
word symmetry mean right idea
behind symmetry tell
rule
theory leave alone
equivalent specifying theory
example um want ask
law law physic
impacted fact
experiment move
experiment 5t left
experiment get
answer right
implication law
physic turn
phenomenon know law
physic shouldnt care whether
laboratory versus 5t
left thats much linked
something like conservation
momentum classical physic
fact experiment
today get answer tomorrow
related idea energy
conserved classical physic
um sort shift
something know concrete way
talked know moving
experiment
experiment different point time
uh general say
could characterize different
way know pick
something turn look
know shift description
stay actually tell
equation compatible
really predictive way ive
got another symmetry mirror
symmetry u
mirror symmetry uh
originally discovered um context
string compactifications
considering solution string theory
could lead know physic like
see universe compact
extra dimension people trying
write discovered
solution could find seem
come pair pair involved
interchanging topological number
topological number way
change geometry sorry
characterized way
change geometry um without
intrinsically changing
classic example
change donut coffee cup
picture know taking
donut imagine material
rubbery could stretch
squish way want
cut deform shape
change put another hole
coffee cup little
finger hole handle yeah yeah
wouldnt work didnt
handle right right
like drinking glass doesnt work
yeah coffee cup starbucks
doesnt handle
right okay okay idea
geometry single hole
cant change number hole
whether thats center doughut
could smoosh around
turn handle coffee cup
um thats whats called topological
invariant number hole
one example topological
number donut one hole
could imagine know donut
built two hole
know kind thing
describes characterizes geometry
mirror symmetry geometry
come topological number
combination could turn
could one
configuration sort
divide space possible geometry
half case uh tell
know
interchangeable concrete way
wow
man insane
first
really great question thats
crazy love though well got
well
cracking egg know
kabi yao manifold
example configuration
shape extra dimension
string theory satisfy einstein
equation um half
billion possibility
talking manifold didnt get
word manifold yeah yall got
star trek get
named two clever
mathematician um yeah manifold
conjectured exist
mathematician named eugene kabi
proved uh yao field medal
proof um thing
solve einstein equation know
field medal dont
kind like nobel prize
mathematics um given major
know substantive discovery
mathematics um catch got
40 get um
young clever oh man
course mathematician would use
chronology determining fact yeah
discriminating agist think
yeah exactly homological
field mirror symmetry um
example something
dialogue string theory
mathematics really fruitful
observation clabia
manifold topology first
observed string theory
mathematician went away tried
sort explain happening
found correspondence lot
deeper mathematical structure
actually led another field metal
gentleman named kvich thats maxim
kvich maxim sound russian
exactly type structure
know dialogue math
physic personally think really
fruitful weve learned lot
mathematician um building
kind thing fun
question im asking recently
know could new variant
could lead new physic new
prediction particle physic
also new mathematical structure
duality looking
right involve changing two
manifold two configuration
geometry actually mixing thing
like electromagnetic field
background geometry there
sort weird wonderful uh
know mixing possible degree
freedom theory could still
magically leave physic alone
there surely plenty physicist
perfectly trained
physic dont math
background way theyre kind
researching blinder given
much see mathematical
regime fair characterization
push back somebody might
say know youre youre sort
torturing trying solve
really hard problem math physic
time lot
question dont need
degree math unfortunately
path physical question want
answer lead crazy hairy
geometry high dimension able
answer physic want
string theory kind dont
choice evokes einstein
dont think totally
nonucuklitian geometry differential
geometry wasnt totally
needed help right
even though physic going
oh man would love meet einstein
tutor
tutor einstein
geometry thats yeah
marriage frontier physic
emergent math mean
going since beginning
might offer cosmic perspective
close righty one
feature research scientist
academia get really smart people
working problem there
obligation expectation there
sellable product end
exercise mean mind
roam freely boundary
known unknown
universe physic always
occurred
always occurred tandem
advance mathematics go back
ancient greece theyre trying
measure shape earth
round word geometry get
introduced look
mean mean earth measurement
geometry
look juxtaposition
advance science advance
mathematics two field
often people school say
dont good math im good
physic im going meanwhile
foundation understanding
place existence universe
look forward advance
frontier physic
marry advance
mathematics matter obscure
might look passer one day
end youll living
currently trapping
modern engineering technology
society large
thats cosmic perspective
lara mean delightful
conversation weve learned lot
youve youve told u lot
maybe learned maybe twothirds
uh whats fraction
dumb ever
feel smart go thats
matter youre
virginia tech teach uh course
general relativity einstein
relativity uh love youre pure
theorist right dont dont
invite particle
accelerator correct
invited im im kept
short leash let um
see mountain observing
mountain chile invited
theorist come came
earthquake wow
he never invited back yeah
clear theorist get
get lab
know end telescope
look know
fun riff time know
need yes yes thanks
laura star talk
chuck always good man
always pleasure right
star talk string theory edition
neil degrasse tyson keep looking
music
