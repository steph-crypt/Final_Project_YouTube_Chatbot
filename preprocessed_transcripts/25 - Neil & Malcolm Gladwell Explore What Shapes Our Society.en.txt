fascinating area
criminology one great
insight last generation
criminological work send 10 cop
corner bad guy move
answer dont criminal
lazy br keep wallet god dude
there cop let tomorrow
criminology rooted place
individual oh absolutely cuz
would think would random
right random block
crime block crime block
crime like 15 year
strangest
thing star talk neil degrass
tyson personal astrophysicist im
chuck kn chucky baby hey neil
yeah whats happening got really
cool guest today one coolest
coolest like ever yeah mean
nerd audience nerd audience malcol
gladwell welcome back start talk
thank may third time
im checking number last
year 20 hear say

writing bestselling book whats
problem el serious
affliction isnt huh wake
youre like oh vomit
bestsell bed
happen wish quality
vomit thats youre saying im
looking list blink
remember blink dog saw think
missed one uh goliath outlier
tipping point big one
tipping point big big
course uh right uh youve got
revenge tipping point uh
like tipping point sequel
yeah part
two marvel marvel universe
getting okay well question
revenge referring there
number revenge oh okay okay
think think thinking
revenge pink panther date
terribly okay revenge pink
panther revenge nerd would
gone nerd good one
thats big revenge pink panther
little let
characterize ive got note
say unravel strange human
phenomenon reveal science
psychology underpins conduct
malcolm remind u
year since original tipping point
remind u thesis book
idea wrote
tipping point uh
covering aid epidemic
washington post oh come
journalist journal chop
immersed epidemiology
like good six year let
remind people epidemiology know
study epidemic behave yeah yeah
epidemic spread
contained even
infect infect
infect thats
basically epidemic mean like
many um scientific profession
certain moment
epidemiologist matter
certain moment forget
conversation among
hiv one
occasion suddenly seemed
know part cultural
conversation co another
sudden heard people
dont dont normally pay
attention
immersed world epidemiologist
fascinated peculiar
way
epidemic disease behave
library nyu bob library one
day used go hang
stack read uh academic journal
randoms geeky
geeky geeky erect
statue okay one
day remember moment
uh
hm one aisle
okay reading back issue
one dont tell havent done
go keep going
way im hm two guy know um
reading back bound volume
back issue american journal
sociology read paper guy
called jonathan crane
whole premise paper let use
um epidemiological model
examine um social pathology crime
delinquency teenage pregnancy
spread way article
think uh uh
article 1980s oh
modern article
like 1800s time wrote
novel idea yeah
literally taking l taking
formal principle disease
epidemiology laying
soci thats think term
specifically disease human behavior
might track
understand began im
impressed well
mean interesting begin
first time
ever seen read article
clear wasnt rich
literature people formally
applying mean may informally
used formally applying
technique showed
example
um used would mathematical technique
wouldnt yes mathematical technique
one thing showed example
percentage uh
professional people higher
education fell certain uh
critical threshold social problem
exploded thought incredibly
interesting yes tracked across
neighborhood looked
migration certain kind role
model word
remove role model know first
couple remove doesnt make
sudden there kind
moment boom
ti tipping point okay
library new
york 19
1996 living
beginning extraordinary
decline crime new york
trying make sense
nobody could explain would
crime fall whatever fell iously
precipitously 90 everyone
course want take credit
everyone want take credit yeah
wasnt new york city
whole country although later
new york city interesting
there two new york city crime
decline keep going um
one could explain wanted
understand conceptually struck
read article
conceptual explanation
crime contagious phenomenon
tipped way
epidemic often tip
genesis book tipping point wow
wow okay thats fascinating
begin stack academic
library im playing
right neil okay good
good one story
remember book yeah uh talk
big bird long thing sesame
street long retrospect
went back went back reread
like
chapter
section stayed
never know little feature
story actually going make
difference put top yeah
remember correctly
suggested big bird
absurd element sesame street
think right youre
walking around say gee let get seven
foot yellow bird bird right need
who thinking right right
everybody wrote sesame
street high
hell wo smoking good
stuff remembering
correctly big bird well
interested dimension
know important dimension
understanding contagion
duration kind
um contagious window right okay uh
know covid basically
48h hour window highly
contagious anybody responds
infectious window uh
24 hour ability
virus could exactly
every dimension ability
spread would cut half dimin
even half longer
incubation period effective
virus exactly malcolm
concept stickiness yeah
help u transition original
tipping point revenge
tipping point like three rule
three three rule uh
call law
idea epidemic often
always epidemic driven
small fraction
population interesting super
spreader super spreader
know funny
whole backlash super spreader
um epidemiological community
many people saying look
uh uh contagious um uh virus know
dont see co
happened co kind er
example uh asymmetry
epidemic like room
interesting part
fascinating part write new book
talking aerosol
expert guy study
aerosol particle air
yeah droplet come
mouth speak
covid virus particle inh
aerosol think thats reason
mask work
attached aerosol stop
aerosol absolutely virus partic
virus much much smaller virus
still carried airus
cant fly thats im
saying carried thats
carried droplet
examine large group
people discover
um there small number
people whose level aerosol production
like 10 20 30 40 time greater
mean thing super spreading
super spreader probably
dont know right fact
almost
physiological reason people
production aerosol high like
big mouth people
large lung talk loud
still figuring
hypothesis table there one
guy guy named edward harvard
think correlated
obesity age
interesting another little
slightly convincing
explanation come guy
say really driven
something quite idiosyncratic way
um saliva move
um uh throat canal there
small group people studied
production aerosol across
variety know like theyre really
interested automobile emission
theyre really interested air
pollution theyre interested
fry bacon come
bacon know smell
smelling right kind
early
pandemic bunch
obscure feel theyre chemist right
theyre involved um
uh medicine human biology
early pandemic one
incredibly obscure aerosol journal
bunch aeros solists wrote
editorial like march 2020
said first thing
airborne
coming aerosol two
youre going see really really
really
asymmetrical distribution aerosol
production aware 1
population damage
told u gave u road map
march 2020 part think
think neil know
exactly im talking
difficult go back mean
time dont know pay
attention there there dis
there disciplinary thing
hard get attention
public health biologist time
crisis chemist saying
theyre thats dawn co youre
reading youre saying oh
chemist answer even
im saying dont inventory
every possible paper
written go back say
hey insight
listened 99 others
didnt listen shouldnt
listened call
hindsight hey star talk fan dont
know know audio
version podcast actually post
week advance video version
get spotify apple
podcast podcast outlet
multiple way
ingest cosmic star talk
law
third law well
third law power
context book im
talk call overstory
idea
narrative
community uh powerfully inform
behavior member
community way may
aware get whole
literature medical variation
way doctor practice differs
completely inexplicable bizarre way
one community next across um
develop world mean mean give
example way
cardiologist treat buffalo
radically different way
cardiologist treat boulder
fact might better doctor
went better medical school
there something wrong
civilized society whats
interesting doctor
power knowledge
wisdom insight treating
dont thats problem
observation something
slightly different
say way youre treated
different boulder bming
boulder buffalo thats say
one worse right
different way
uh buffalo better boulder
way boulder better
better buffalo nothing
may
true even doc cardiologist
boulder buffalo attended
medical school interesting
quite apart difference
training know go uh
put theyre
catheter uh america youre
cardiac cath catheter uh longest
time put catheter thigh
right thigh standard buffalo
artery vein go
buffalo put
wrist okay wrist harder
learn
complication way lower
faster safer better outcome
learn
first buffalo way ahead
putting wrist place like
boulder way behind buffalo
way guy invented
putting wrist
wrist montreal
closer source hood
spread montreal toronto right
toronto buffalo
there lot back forth
cardiologist cannot sit
calmly defend fact would
say future ai would
understood perfectly wouldnt
need regional difference awareness
doctor yeah thats future
civiliz uniform protocol
established
mean eventually happens bowler
eventually catch go
heart attack theyre
gonna put wrist
sure delay
partially caused lack
knowledge requires doctor
person putting catheter get
extra training everyone around
buffalo wrist
wrist otherwise look like like
fool right interesting boulder
theyre theyre
um th thigh
thigh bring ai learn
actually wow
dont want going doctor
going doctor threw doctor
bus thats
like tell
going going actually go
thigh mean
artery let doctor bleed
whats line shakespeare
first kill lawyer first
kill doctor thats theon
tyson prescrition said
somebody ai going
develop new method somebody
disseminated
instantly right performed possibly
robotic uh surgeon sound
like youre saying
influence upon one another
epidemiological phenomenon uh thats
well well put yeah said there
obesity epidemic said cant
catch fat people
calling epidemic resistant
time im much relaxed
going say based
discussing actually
catch fat people
happens
sociological um ill say pressure
lead obesity resident
particular sub society people
actually join behavior
behavior turn lead obesity
indeed caught fat caught
fat want go private uh
girl school upper side
manhattan go uh know
rural high school alabama uh tell
isnt isnt uh
profound difference um cultural
circumstance drive obesity right
yeah im saying warmed
im first heard
thinking biologically culturally
resistant using ever
way ive softened
time take new book
new
perspective youre bringing
table much um uh taken
uh dynamic
epidemic word law
example begin
realize much radical
observation epidemic driven
small number people
realized first book
thinking kind know 8020 rule
there know big group u
realize oh super
specific specific really
number people drive epidemic
tiny tiny tiny fraction
population need
expectation u somehow
lumped middle sort
equally contribute thing
wrong um im much fascinated
mystified pattern
environmental um contagion
first book dont really
understand youve raised
issue could become social culturals
example find
certain type people super
oh yeah call um super emitter
super emitter okay find
super emitter contained within
one genetic demographic requires
different solution resolve
know different
aid epidemic remember well old
enough remember old enough
remember like
disease homo male homosexual
therefore ban know people dont
react rationally kind
information
analysis revelation
manifest term policy well thats
youre putting
finger extremely important point
would say youre absolutely right
many troubling
outcome positive
outcome simple answer
start
conversation exactly dont trust
u specie based history
anthropology especially european
anthropology say
group place race track
record track record bad
right eugenics
nazism bad uh may
treat everybody equally
knowing treatment excessive
right others
one get differently treated
may solution oh see
youre saying u may
suffer little others
might achieve greater good
serving whatever measure
taken taken across board even
though dont really apply
much think need got
example might 90
100 people dont need wear mask
theyre spewing thing
still make everybody wear mask see
whole whole problem
people like dont
want wear mask even though
like listen know 1918
starting back know
fact masking reduces
transmission know fact
people like dont care different
thats freedom call came
later different im
making simple point
society want everyone
treated equally law
law applies people
must wear mask rest
dont experience
specie tell work yeah
make rule
everyone thats well let give
another example phenomenon
okay uh one thing
criminologist observed
pattern extreme variation
um happen uh violent crime yes
look map new york city
city matter find
like 5 street segment
block uh 5 street segment
new york city account north 50
violent crim super specific
say street segment
talking saying south
bronx dangerous place
saying
south bronx totally safe
spe there 10
hotpot yeah there street corner
know york uh 91st
thats problematic rational
response say oh dont
need police distribution
police every precinct city
nypd
caused second great decline
crime decline new york
said okay going shift huge
number resource know
90 place relatively safe
dump
specific hotspot im sure people
anticipated argument
youre making saying people going
object theyre going say
youre taking 10 police officer
away precinct send
street corner like know
east new york thats unfair blah
turn people
think able realize
bringing overall crime rate
city uh um made
price worth paying could
convince showing oh
going make whole city better
place u give
10 didnt crime move
another block like
pornography time square know
knock went 7th
avenue eth avenue 10th avenue
right went internet
everybodys right youre
going get rid something kind
built system
fascinating area
criminology one great
insight last generation
criminological work made
observation went
question displacement called
criminology okay send 10
cop corner know york
avenue 91st bad guy
mooved 93 93rd 95th answer
dont little bit
mean see displacement
remarkable extent criminal
lazy theyre lazy walk away
keep wallet god dud there cop
let tomorrow youre
right uh word would use
criminology rooted place
word individual
oh absolutely famous work
done think first time
seattle took
simple thing one
longest time overlay crime
data map right one ever done
systematic way
finally started guy
guy named wei bird david wei bird
discover pattern
like there like look b
started seattle look map
seattle there like 15 hotpot
seattle huge proportion hot
spot block huge proportion
violent crime happening given
moment say okay
happens look next year data
spot move dont move
happens look five year later
spot move dont move spot
arent moving dont one
one kind ultimately
satisfactory answer
would think would random
right right random
take actually
someone took tour baltimore
guy worked weisberg woman
work weisberg drove around
baltimore day
exact thing drive like
worst neighborhood west baltimore
would say uh block crime
block crime block
crime like 15 year next block
crime next sc strangest
thing wow really strangest
thing fascinating revelation
book reader
like well never knew never
cuz homework right
put book arrive
point awareness presumably
lead solution
would ultimately problem left
write book whats
whats going confidence
always problem
write ne question
fix one place
move get go go go back
spot move spot move
sp whats interesting
rant criminology
favorite love criminology much
fascinating field much
happened
last generation term
understanding crime like
thats another reason wanted write
book writing crime
19 excuse 1990s compared
writing crime today
literally like writing
physic einstein writing
physic afterwards okay hence
youre see dont like way
constantly constant
necessary welcome like
improving comfort level
count softened every think
everything fra really
coming prism physic
kind
uh part lead
update sequel yeah
analysis renewed way
really originally
thought going revised
edition original tipping point
anniversary realized
cant revise something thats rooted
understanding 25 year
ago cant got start
kind nature tipping
point dont see coming yeah
mean think oh
see coming late ah okay
anticipation tipping point
world ani
phenomenon tipping phenomenon cu
use know everything
fact know
cant prevent happening
let imagine let use
example covid december november
2019 report coming
wuhan let let another
version say
vastly improved surveillance
somebody
regularly sampling
um know spread uh ind
people infected
monitoring spread virus
little closely
could kind run data
know advanced algorithm say
absence intervention thing
blow march would
typing point great yeah yeah think
youd thats
epidemiologist supposed able
never ever
resource give
resource fact fact
build really effective
surveillance system mean
right whole
avan flu thing quite terrifying
honest would like
little experiment go five
year give
epidemiologist everything want
say want
totaled whats hilarious
science funding
country number tiny like
entire budget nhh like 40 billion
long long like somebody
could slip past cong
could add zero slip past
congress one would notice one
know add zero see
know see happens 4
billion grand scheme thing
yeah like like thats
theyre arguing
epidemiologist added
everything wanted literally
would million im sure
call budget dust thats call
really small enough barely noticed
oh put budget dust nice
played game said lot
nasa program want put
nasa budget right yeah nih
used less nasa memory
serf theyre higher nasa
uh nasa 25 30 billion
right ness visible
thing space station
james webace telescope rover
visible going back
moon lot public recognition
nasa thats right
youre absolutely right look
full budget country
talking nothing
want champion
epidemiologist cool think itd
mean consequence
think itd great economic
consequence another pandemic know
talking trillion
dollar trillion like seems like
really really really insurance policy
yeah yeah take minor insurance
policy someone told
total amount money would cost every
year permanently predict protect u
prepare u future uh viral
outbreak um something like 25 billion
year word could
could vaccine ready
anything isnt already
trying anticipated flu
vaccine year go understand
go southern hemisphere
australia see
season absolutely know
make across
river ever
um near niyak
like could drive 20 minute
dont let
know cra totally
crazy thing theyre like
growing like um growing
theyre growing grow virus
find flu virus
pick strain right big
strain picking conference every year
like year
think rock going honey
im going strain
picking find virus
thatll show later year ago
post think went
went one meeting
big huddle
everyone make case one train
one think going
win thats one
need lead time take
long time make virus got
youre picking quite early
another area could say
ai thing like
improve um improve
accuracy know
grade
well shrink
could shrink time take
make vaccine pick later
accuracy go mean
hundred thousand life lie
balance insanely
consequential decision people dont
realize flu
regular flu
influen still somewhere around 45000
people year yeah popping
co believe even
higher yeah
even higher still day know
people dont think
nasty yeah nasty nasty yeah
want ask something
epidemiologist opinion
seem unorthodox mean
finding information think
work like remember
covid first say
right got study poop
going study people poop
sewer
amazing predict
community going
outbreak studying poop
people heard studying poop
like oh get get hell get
yeah poop stuff
actually really fascinating
poop stuff uh one
first place began see
radical asymmetry could could
see enormous number amount virus
coming specific
location wasnt uniformly spread
like um forgotten there
incredible story one aerosol
told kind analysis
think know people need get
like dont understand
there something something happened
fell love
kind scientific enterprise
went span generation
eagerly lining get shot
somehow afraid needle
mean hon solve
well uh think stop call
calling vaccine vaccine good name
facelift jennifer call jennifer
think im go give
jennifer imagine could
easily
uh something sniff right
could nasal yes um suppose
said didnt call
vaccine called cocaine
cocaine said something sniff
figure people like cocaine something
yeah would would appeal
say look
way take know
people take know eonia ward
cold say sniff ward
co hard right actually
think awful lot way vaccine
skepticism fear needle
acknowled think lot people
would would rather make pretend
make principled ideological case
science admit theyre
scared needle absolutely agree
100 c certain
amount people every year
country take aspirin nid
cenin die okay dont
hear thats part
risk right nobody say
well would never take
safe whatever know
stick needle arm theyre
like invasive im putting
something well youre putting
something every time breathe
youre putting something every
time swallow something youre
putting something every time
eat youre always putting something
reason reason
needle seems invasive yeah
many kind myth
thing scary
something getting inside u
know thats may thats
original alien movie potent right
yeah little snake man
popped yeah stomach yeah
thats yeah beast yeah yeah
ever wanted one question

fact send autographed
copy one latest book
uh right star messenger cosmic
perspective civilization
signed fancy fountain pen
purple ink invite check
link money
go ability experiment
new way bringing universe
earth thank
already joined welcome others
participate grand adventure
bring universe
earth always keep looking
think epidemiologist need
money give u
epidemiologist participate
exercise well
really interesting broader question
uh right amount
kind
specialist society dont know
dont know whether right
amount epidemiologist
way find conduct experiment
like epidemiological exp
epidemiological experiment
double number matter right let
double number see happens
double amount money give
let make observe
better worse
effectively postwar
year america post second
world war post second world war yeah
know
increased number english
professor extraordinary number
right done weve done
experiment didnt know weve
increased number plastic surgeon
america last periodically
radically know uh number
soldier first world war r
know ratcheted overnight
would make better prediction
would make better anticipation
next virus theyll
turn theyre necessarily
virus maker youd fund rep
would inform people
actually making therapeutic
vaccine mean quality
information would flow
direction would improve might
future absence
devastating
virus capacity handle
come would solve
problem much perfect
antiviral serum would anti every
viral virus right thats dream yeah
dream system
place matter virus never
get foothold yeah idea
building like economist know
talk endlessly state capacity
something distinct
knowledge resource
ability act information
information think
focused heavily state capacity
favorite state capacity example would
co best detector covid
dog far h far smelling
yeah yeah yeah sense smell could
went episode
podcast went alabama
train covid sniffing dog dog
outperform every test covid um
know dog weve known
long time dog better
know detect colon
colon colon cancer better
colonoscopy detect prostate
cancer better uh uh one
antigen test theyre really
good something distinctive
um see smell see smell
good state
capacity uh preparation next
pandemic uh breed ton ton
ton talk favorite thing
giant like kind
strategic canine know uh unit uh
reserve right okay well put
oklahoma well like 10000 german
shepherd next theyre
sniffer butt crot theyre
yeah
imagine roll
guy find prostate
cancer oh actually f
fascinating clinical trial
dog matched know
stateoftheart um clinical testing
dog blow water
every time dog like amazing
theyre smelling prostate cancer
cancer yes walking
yes know dog test covid
imagine wanted test everyone
coming museum co
imagine there line saturday
morning there line get
actually every morning line every
morning take dog dog
literally line go
line run line
stop bark
like man thats racist
dog man dog racist dont
co theyre astonishingly good
wow state capacity want
strategic puppy reserve thing
think country need
strategic puppy reserve puy would
work would get funded like
would get funded
second puppy look face
dont co one
sadly stopped alabama
brilliant idea um
prisoner uh breed dog uh testing
purpose turned
extraordinary transformed uh
prison community way
completely unti mean turn
bringing dog kind
think make sense
environment transformed
sort um mean
rehabilitation prisoner
able identify co
easily lot dog robbery
started
happening think think
like im joking need um anyway
im want go puppy
crusade point next uh
see scientist would invent
machine smell
part per billion dog well theyre
trying theyre actually
using theyre exactly theyre
moving dog back machine
yes thats thats want
yeah dog know trying
figure dog
sensing perfect mach
cant grab machine ear
go
go also wouldnt rather sniffed
dog could put ear
machine okay ne colonoscopy
dog sniffing thats
much upgrade would take
second thats upgrade
literally dog
walk whatever
german shepherd
lab walk sniff
go home dont know
german shepherd though theyre
little intimidating like
let sniff
plus german shepherd never like
black people exactly
paper long
use dog
civil right movement
