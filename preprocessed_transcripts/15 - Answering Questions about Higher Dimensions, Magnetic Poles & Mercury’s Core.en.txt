tell live
open universe mean
expanding forever right
sight line come back
go
sighteline continually moving
correct closed universe
universe recolapse sight
line principle ultimately come
back way think
surface sphere right
call perfect spherical balloon
crawling around surface
balloon
dont look im
astrophysicist
music
star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist
cosmic query today
mean chuck sitting right next
yes chuck hey whats
happening topic
grabbing know oh
galactic gumbo thats right thats
right wont give way im
going give put im
going put guy pepper didnt
die like 20 year ago dont paul
prudome name dont know
name seen lately
boy packing
weight havent seen 20
year okay
well thank granting
accent damn thats dont
say whatever random
theyre patreon member whoever
want patreon
member correct okay havent seen
question
get see im supposed see
im lazy dont see
okay right go yeah uh
writer eye say hello
everyone hope day filled
proton friendly star oh
maybe meant photon photon
yeah say proton
misread say proton
didnt misread sometimes
know would read thing
thought maybe reading fundamental
fundamental
thought maybe know
talking like pulsar something
know send sending
particle okay uh
probably didnt mean photon right
friendly star say far
away able track
gravity wave know detect
tracking would next
obvious step humble opinion
could track
eventually could map universe
edge edge correct thinking
couple thing first
technicality right kind wave
made gravity wave two colliding
black hole okay called
gravitational wave gravitational
wave right okay gravity wave
something else acoustical people
term people use refer
medium thats rising falling
response pressure uh impulse
go gravity
wave call make
sure kingdom
separated okay lexographic
nice lexographic reference
correct distinct gravitational
wave okay uh detect
wash u right thats
ligo thats earned nobel
prize right know earned
nobel prize kip thorne one
executive producer
um wait minute wait minute wait
string theory movie
matthew mcconey called
interstellar interstellar yes good
fact took crew
pasadena life went
home office interviewed kip thorne
cool yeah yeah find
archive uh showed u
nobel prize cool
keep thing huh know right
wear around neck
else would
take everywhere oh yeah know
mean excuse know
time im like oh excuse
let move nobel prize
way see watch dont
get come
oh goodness nobel
prize watch oh
goodness here learned
recently yes detect
certain energy level gravitational
wave wash earth right
there certain phenomenon
universe make gravitational
wave detector cannot see
okay okay there something
know little bit
want put table okay
right there research
program thats going put play
want detect effect
gravitational wave moving
across field view
pulsar
precise spinning rate accurate
clock set clock okay
gravitational wave pass
right there change rate
right youll see rhythm change
rhythm change briefly yes
idea monitor
pulsar get rhythm known
right see one change
look see
coincides gravitational wave
well well would evidence
see move next one
next one right
would see consistency across
post correct youd
watching gravitational wave move
across medium space thats
amazing yes yet
thats unfortunately cut
funding cut
already weve saved much money
even thinking know
know
let subject let remind
much money nasa get
government
space station space shuttle hubble
jwst james webb everything nasa
everything nasa going
back moon including looking back
earth weather everything
weather would noah thats noah
okay okay there
strong collaboration
yeah two right
know like 10 year noah
founded caught
like pronounced like noah like noah
arc like noah arc yeah cuz
first weatherman
thinking oh god right
didnt im catching
caught
actually spell first
weatherman hey going rain
god say going rain man people
like talking
noah talking
hasnt rain never rained
never im telling man im
building boat going
rain oh oh crazy go
know
well grow grape
understanding made might made
wine drink maybe man made little
bible reference drink
yeah yes go ahead noah
way drink im
saying thats rough like im
telling right going
rain lord spoke told
yeah who going believe
right told get three every
animal think two anyway go
ahead let move okay
course spelled n n
national oceanic atmospheric
administration okay yeah one
make remind people
much money tax dollar
right 410 1 cent
even full penny yeah say
want save money right
total impact going
given rest spending
thats going right
efficient mean cost cutting yeah
department
efficiency could efficient
efficient
right think need efficient
department efficiency
exactly right okay next one
go let move maurice van
derindon maurice vand derindon
say hey neil hey chuck
wondering something jan 11 said
episode might
possible look far enough
cosmos line sight
loop around universe end
position along
timeline doesnt imply
true universe perfect 4d
sphere would see past location
case young solar system
every angle would appear smeared
across cosmic horizon love
show kind regard maurice harlem
netherlands oh harlem yes
yes harlem uh got
name harlem harlem new york
new york yeah back dutch
running yeah owned
owned put canal
canal street yes
know dutch thats
absolutely even back oh nothing
canal
dont know answer
precision thats talking
tell live
open universe mean
expanding forever right
sight line come back
go
sighteline continually moving correct
away u away
u there way could loop
back always going closed universe
universe recolapse
sighteline principle
ultimately come back way
think surface
sphere right call balloon
perfect spherical balloon
crawling around surface
balloon send beam
light would go away
come around come back hit
back head right right
would later right okay
balloon begin shrink back
well wouldnt
shrink closed
closed shrink
h dont look im
astrophysicist
cosmic microwave background
right done experiment
test oh micro
background every direction right
look way get
exact know exactly patterning
thats happening mhm
look way turn around right
exact pattern pattern
thats thing mean
place right
mean line went around
met side right okay
havent found havent
weve looked point weve looked
carefully statistically
significant repeated pattern
throughout cosmic gotcha okay
yeah okay okay thats best
answer thats great
answer janna might come
teeth answer well
yeah well leave janna yeah
know shes always mindblower thats
cool right iiggore
vhaneek vhan igore young
frankenstein okay igor
think young frankenstein he
igore he igore he also marty
feldman big giant bug eye
think anyway uh say
hello gentleman dr
frankenstein right dr frankenstein
thought e e ei
yeah einstein oh einstein
e e dont didnt know
never heard listen
barely get e except c
except neil right except
science except keith yeah
think got rid rule
spell word wrong
think got im even lying
got would yeah im exception
rule whole lot boatload
word right go
say hey gentleman uh name
igor zagreb croatia im
firsttime caller
like thats good
excellent say ive always
wondered higher dimension
could expansion universe
caused spacetime falling another
dimension like 3d space
waterfall falling higher
dimension simply perceive
expanding direction would
mean dark energy thank man
interesting first let
tell igor know kind
weed smoking croatia
please send yes
send u croatian weed
go ahead uh weird concept
spaceime here thing falling
another dimension right
there evidence one dimension
susceptible another dimension
way correct example let
take surface table right
many dimension thats two
two length width
depth depth
another surface table
make table infinite right
correct another table
thats separated thats also
infinite theyre running
parallel run parallel
theyre there one there
interaction third dimension
there embed
twodimensional surface three
dimension itll sit
two dimension two dimension inside
three
dimens calling
okay something thats
related okay exactly
answering question address
question right thats good
right world quantum
physic lot mysterious thing
happen mathematically
mysterious intellectually
mysterious particle pop
existence matter energy
equivalent particle behave
way entangled know there
weirdness thats going
describe mathematically
though weirdness completely
normal higher dimension let
ask would
example uh let go back 2d
world okay
walking around slithering around 2d
people get around line drawing
yeah perimeter
right right suppose
looking around see dot right
came nowhere yes
like particle popping existence
there dot whered come
dont know right keep
watch study scientist
study dot becomes circle
circle
grows say studying
making measurement grows
like maximum point
start shrinking back get
smaller smaller dot
disappears wow wed coming
kind theory right
alien alien live rural
america rural part
paper city people see
rural part paper
two dimensional dot
tell middle night
dot showed got bigger bigger
okay go ahead cant explain
dont understand right
like studying elephant
dont see whole elephant yeah
okay get seven different
description trunk
tusk leg toenail tail
side none comport
take step back say
youre describing creature
okay thats full understanding
one get first know
described
hole
described sphere passing
paper paper one point
dot single
point sphere thats touching
twodimensional plane
continue move sphere
point 360Â°
sphere keep fanning
two dimension make hole
keep getting bigger circle
big circle get
whatever size diameter
diameter come back
one point
mysteriously inventing force
phenomenon normal wow
normal sphere wow
higher dimension example
three dimension u two
dimensional ro rural paper stand
paper stand rural paper stand
serious phenomenon
serious theyre reporting
government right people
trying capture next one oh wow
thats great higher dimension
pas otherwise interact
mysterious could right
wow dude great question
trying account dark
energy dont know could
happening higher dimension
manifest dimensionality dark
energy right could could
thing right could yeah
right natt wood say
good day professor tyson lord nice
adelaide australia
best could guy
thats pretty good tried thats
thats good good french
accent tried okay
gumbo accent yeah said
wondering cant ever
truly touch anything could space
particle dark matter pulling
particle together dark energy
repulsing particle well there
another thing pull particle
anyway enjoy every podcast dont
editorialize man question
thinking loud im sorry im
sorry im sorry nat enjoy every
podcast remain inspired
guy every day please keep good
work anyway excellent okay
answer choosing
people say nice thing
one idea well ive never
seen okay say
would never he paid read
advance oh see let let
record show exactly
okay forgot question
he basically saying like
never touch anything truly could
dark matter
touching thats pushing pulling
right turn dark matter
interact
potently regular matter
interesting okay regular
matter get together right
molecule grab make solid
object liquid gas itll itll
make okay regular matter
planet right rock
thats regular matter using
electromagnetic force case
wondering right dark matter
call dark matter
really dark gravity respond
electromagnetic force
doesnt interact doesnt interact
okay doesnt interact u
way okay interact
way interact
gravitationally though
pocket dark matter
nowhere dense
solid object wow far
tell there solid dark matter
okay way
exist would pas
doesnt interact
doesnt interact anyway force
thats holding together right
got another instruction set let slip
right hand particle
already accounted
behavior force known
right there nothing mysterious
might known
dont actually touch thing
episode cosmos
bring two thing together
feel like youre touching
whats happening electromagnetic
force repelling
youre responding force thinking
solid thing
foury old
world backup card
going im touching im
touching im touching
okay im touching right
go stson
stson say hello like madonna
share he stson say
hello dr tyson lord nice stson
u currently living
japan ah well yes uh konichiwa say
study planet including
quite fascinating internal
structure planet generally
agreed upon would able
understand internal structure
planet even nearby great
question great question
make educated guess
test guess oh making
thats said
making go along oh god
breaking
news breaking news
right let take ahead let take
mercury okay mercury example
okay mercury tiny right small
small closest sun right
oh yeah closest planet
closest okay fact moon might
even bigger mercury yeah
check
small small okay okay
full legit planet okay
whats going well measure
mass
mass way
higher could possibly
mercury composed rock like
moon moon made rock
mercury much mass
go periodic table element
say here birth ingredient
solar system wow know
thats sun made
thats jupiter jupiter didnt
give mass born
look composition
jupiter match sun
okay anybody else who different
youve horse trading
ingredient along way right
jupiter trying sun
true thats jupiter
trying jupiter like imma get
one day fact jupiter
planet radiates energy
receives sun oh didnt know
thats thats thats
wannabe thats wannabe sun
yeah still still
rad right thats great factoid
go ahead go periodic table
say element
rare basically
really solar system im
going ignore
common nickel iron
pretty common
universe maybe get mass
mercury fitting volume
throwing something heavier rock
know rock surface
see cratering look
like surface moon okay
deep inside could
know formed heavy stuff go
middle cuz fluid
thing molten right youre
molten youre heavy youre going
sink sink right youre going sink
okay ask much
iron give u
mass get mass size
basically density right
average density construct
average density object
pulling periodic table
element know universe
find huge core
iron thats dope dope
dope okay im tell god damn
science right buddy
oh work way really
weve discovered asteroid okay
know theyre rocky look
density like way less
dense rock rock right less
dense right whats going oh
thats cool whats going cuz
see volume
fuzzy image know
looking mission go
like got binoculars
harold
look as droid whered get
harold dont anyway go ahead
know harold purple crayon cuz
went harold went sky
purple crayon go
liked harold great great yeah
everybody rock
less mass rock aint
rock well well got made
stuff know right
first idea maybe
asteroid pile rubble
nice
there theyre theyre
coalesed theyre stuck together
theyre stuck together
look total mass total
size volume volume
taken nothing right confounding
deduction density
like floating ball pebble
pebble therell much space
pebble floating
ball density
rock overall density lower
rock matter want
deflect asteroid cant go
push rubber
pile cuz got bunch
little rock coming way cuz
bruce willis messed bad
get push chunk
rest doesnt attached exactly
attached didnt
effect right
density estimate density
estimate major part folk
solar system super cool man
mercuryys small
smallest planet right title formerly
held
pluto poor pluto sigh like
know office
there sympathy pluto
office know youre like
know youre like kendrick drake
mean dont
got beat guy
okay go ahead okay mercury
moon size
mercury might little bigger
however mercury four time mass
moon wow size four time
mass know rocky
surface equal
looking feature surface
whats going know moon
hardly iron right
sideswiped earth crust
crusty baby crusty
thats moon moon crusty
think
iron rest deeply largely within
center mercury boosting
total mass relative normal
object thats thats roll
make calculation
cool right let let got time
think yeah yeah
got time let rock roll
west getting
quick getting
actually getting like
weve done hope people
okay recognizing getting
quickly hello dr
tyson lord nice im wes davenport
iowa one want say
appreciate programming
expertise acquires
know requires exactly
know anyway
expression know
really know appreciate
uh question way used
wrestle go ahead iowa know
wrestler iowa iowa yeah thats cuz
know grow wrestling
cow yeah
getting kick
as every time getting circle
dont mean nothing
yeah theyre hauling calf
holding hauling put
calf put
put shoot dummy
yeah anyway
iowa
wrest proud tradition wrestler
iowa yeah cool say uh
question regarding black hole
happens collide
recent theory enhancement great
mind mathematical
equation work model
expected action reaction
mathematically reproduce collision
black hole absolute
consistency yes
mathematics math
predicted black hole begin
right already
math like here
object oh gosh describe
einstein general theory
relativity right predicted black
hole even though antilo
know yeah well
racist
back actually
wasnt wasnt read
uh idea opinion book
right hubble racist
yeah hubble issue yeah
hubble issue marian anderson
denied singing
opportunity shes opera singer
constitution hall washington dc cuz
run daughter
confederate confederacy okay thats
roosevelt said sing
step lincoln memorial wow
okay einstein active around
like 1930s think
30 roosevelt president
regardless okay yeah would
30 werent war
yet
uh visited princeton visited
einstein princeton campus wow
receiving people
otherwise uh wellknown issue
dealing know society
societ societ societal issue yeah
forward thinking person
cool well yeah mean
great see
brilliant yeah also mean
jew escaping rise nazi german
motivation yeah
empathetic empathetic behavior
yeah make sense yeah
yeah predicted gravity wave
mean gravitational wave mean
math already math
already right right
math place say
must believe
matter would would
didnt think universe would
mean matter really yeah
interesting yeah matter closing
right collapse
nothing stop exactly
singularity yes doesnt make
sense doesnt make sense
said must cant
fine black
hole look got thats
crazy yes
completely described whats
interesting two black
hole enter others event horizon
thats get fun oh really
yeah isnt dominant
black hole mirror
identity happens oh
cuz
youre imagine scenario one
black hole like yeah dominant yeah
one black hole like know
part space im
hungry right
got news going
one black hole going
one time imitate black hole
eating voice
something oh u sad
black hole like hey hey
hey
exactly would sound
like oh goodness spoke
english sound could move
space thats theyd saying
another black hole tasty snack
yeah thats concept
one would dominant
always math
doesnt care math bigger
smaller equal doesnt make
difference here thing
merge new black hole right
exactly mass two
summed together oh thats
count thats count
bigger black hole
go think new
new
uh jared higgby say
greeting dr tyson lord chucky
baby
jared higgby alamo nevada
um north south side
magnet actually different way
outside attraction repelling
effect would determine
side magnet
interesting okay dont
anything go cant turn
attract turn repel
determine one north
one south
completely arbitrary
really yes
tell okay
mean arbitrary
decide agree
thats answer ah
fundamental thing universe
tell north thats right got
there there whispering
secret force operating
definition think remember like
pole repel repel
opposite pole attract okay okay
definition let
say bar magnet itll work
better hold string
middle itll turn part
point north earth north pole
magnet thats
ill set
magnet every
magnet like thats thats
decided guy thats
right there need make choice
decided decided u
one okay mean
north pole magnet
pointing north pole earth
earth south magnetic
pole
wait minute wait north
pole magnet yes pointed
towards north pole earth
attracted south magnet
yes
music
got god come back chuck
need
thats insane north pole
south pole yes earth oh god
effing ridiculous yeah
oh jeez didnt know man
thats crazy thought
call north
pole north magnet point
point north pole north pole
repels exactly somethings
something oh somethings going
wow thats crazy yes earth
south magnetic pole north pole
yes thats insane
dont know believe anymore
cant believe anything anymore
okay someone
ask ask
make north pole
earth right arbitrary
arbitrary well yeah cuz
sitting
well folk south pole
might another opinion
matter exactly okay exactly thats
another one criy okay anyway thats
another one thats decided decree
arbitrary consensus
okay know get
ask way earth spinning
okay okay curl hand take
right hand mhm curl finger
direction earth spinning
point thumb thats north
pole yeah look thats
thats suppose people
lefthanded there lefthand
rule righthand rule okay
see uh there plus
people lefthanded thats
point discriminating left
hand think left people
dominated dominantly lefthanded
would probably done way
oh north pole would
south yeah
left hand rule yeah okay yeah
rotating object thats
say planet uranus
tipped 98 degree vertical oh
okay hows possible
another axis thats
right right hand rule
space take
thats cool man yeah thats
cool thats planet
thats 180 degree flipped right
dont say well call
north rotation
rotation yeah okay thats cool
man right go right
good think time one
question two answer
half time math okay go
go hugo dart say
hello dr tyson lord nice
hugo dart rio de janeiro brazil
brazil say sevenyearold
daughter olivia big fan
show here question
bet one breakthrough
astrophysics happening next 50
year would one breakthrough
would would know sure
whether life elsewhere
solar system earth cool either
ocean europa soil
mar right think
water gone uh know sure
whether right
thats important
information much
thats even important think
well know probably next 30
year based mission
scheduled another question okay
go logan sinette
say hello dr tyson lord nice
logan cool name logan cool
name badass say
logan phoenix arizona
mentioned best telescope
discovery unexpected discovery
wondering jwst made
interesting unexpected discovery
thus far one interest
coming mhm
record whats farthest object
universe okay measured
red shift letter z
there mathematical form
bigger z
bigger farther away
object okay day farthest
object z five okay okay
growing coming rank
might hit six built
rose center 25 year ago okay
farther away closer back
time getting beginning
correct right
start beginning
universe couldnt make anything
universe cooled right
right point matter
form like atom form
atom atom co coales
make star make star
universe still expanding call
dark age hasnt made star
yet oh wow okay called dark
age interesting right jwst look
around found galaxy dark age
red shift 14 oh gosh 14 thats
crazy head exploding yeah
first galaxy red shift 14
holy okay b thats
dark age aint supposed
supposed
inongruency timewise
yes dont understand
dont understand galaxy form
correct totally cool
dark
galaxy hey baby dark
galaxy call chocolate
galaxy want
thats time yes
great got lot man
got many question okay
