talk
reference einstein crumb
einstein 1905 dude 26
year old writes series paper
completely knock world
proverbial art yes said
well know speed
distance cover space
divided time elapsed
space time mean
mean thats huge leap already
said id rather measure
space time relative give
absolute nature speed
light wow measuring
stick change change relative
get answer
get answer thats
crazy early 1900 drug
know opiovailable
he ketamine shot
music
star talk neil degrasse tyson
youre personal astrophysicist got
cohost harrison
greenbound harrison
dude good right
first star talk rodeo nope
right right maybe
first rodeo ive never
done rodeo think would die
immediately thats happening
promise uh going talk
einstein today going help
ive heard need
help married cousin
know every time talk
einstein related subject
goto person large jan 11
janet welcome back star talk im
always glad youre like
regular practically know cuz
einstein regular know feel
like want hang around
time yeah janet
tal professor physic
astronomy barnard college columbia
university theoretical cosmologist
yeah mean say astrophysicist
day theoretical physicist
people think cosmology like
cosmetology stuff oh okay right
wanted makeup
want fancy title fine im
comedian im punchline engineer
specializing haha building giggle
construction youre director
science pioneer work
brooklyn one favorite place
quite juxaposition
science creativity art
creative people
side fence really
one yeah come come together
express really feel like pioneerics
sanctuary science part
culture trying hide
something else packaging
something else exists
big appetite
people want know youve also
written bunch book two
like right black hole
survival guide mean like
look tiny dense like black
hole
spoiler alert end well
end well could
guessed think black
hole death guy black hole
survival guide exactly book
normal size neils hand gigantic
there element truth
favorite book like pronounce
black hole blue love
thats british cover thats
nice oh yeah yeah get get
around get around whats
difference british
extra u yeah right well
actually theyre completely different
cover yeah decide yeah
different country issue
others cover changed
albert einstein teeth make
feel less bad one language
translation changed last name
levanova
think czech wow thought
serious license
well help well make less
jewy
kind kind like yeah cuz
made like italian almost
thing woman loving ovum okay
yeah right female thing
talk
ive intermittently referenced
einstein crumb know
eating eating meal enjoy
something spill edge
dont even notice meal
good walk away
plate people see whats
spilled plate say hey
thats tasty want build
work analogy
scientist dog
come like crumb
best nobel prize winning
scientist rufus thank
thought way
let benchmark janna
pronounce right anisabulus
latin ill take
1905 quite year list
einstein 1905
dude 26 year old
happened go writes
series paper
completely knock world
proverbial art yes one
ani
im sure there latin um
morabulous ani thats dating
profile let see
photoelectric effect yes
photoelectric effect idea
sometimes light behaved like
particle wave
sometimes bombard surface
light knock like
basketball might dislodge something
place opposed accumulating energy
like wave might really
shocking first
demonstration light could also
referenced particle yeah
first observation connection
theory observation
actually behaving like particle
sometimes shocking
1800s thought light wave
often still
convenient sometimes
sometimes acting like wave yeah
um instance
really acted like threw
basketball something um really
tiny basketball really tiny
incredible einstein observe
basketball hadnt invented
yet yes right right somehow
dont see dont know jing
sport analogy anyway
photoelectric effect shocker paper one
paper two paper two um special
relativity oh
lot time theory
relativity became real colloquial
thing everythings relative
became invested society often say
could called theory
absolutism einstein really
done adhered
absolute limit speed light
took seriously ly anybody
else taking time fact
people struggling get rid
uh idea speed
light constant
everything dethrone
concept really wasnt taking
constant
constant matter
measure absolutely
youre getting answer even
youre moving light moving
relative measure
speed light right doesnt
exist anything else thats insane
insane concept car coming
coming
faster one car stop
right okay true
speed light run speed
light maybe youre running slowly
maybe youre running near speed
light still coming
speed light chilling
strange seems impossible simple
example im front train
let say train going 60 hour
throw ball 40 mile hour
throw fast probably okay
know definitely could think
anything anything
thought 40 mile hour front
train youre standing
platform fast ball passing
right adding two
yeah yeah 100 mile 100
milesph im front
train mean im calculating
speed im worried needle grass
tyson top train throwing
ball im confused
im 60 mph train shine
beam light measure beam
light going
speed light dont add
trade dont add trade
dont add trade thats thats
bat crazy crazy
einstein meditated long
there kind simple way see
said well know
speed distance cover
space divided time elapsed
space time
mean mean thats huge leap
already said id rather
measure space time
relative give absolute
nature speed light wow
two measuring stick
change change relative
get answer
get answer thats thats
thats measure stick
rate time tick thats crazy
get chill little he
drug know opio
available time either he
ketamine shot okay give
thats two um brownie
motion talk give brownie
emotion mean think
feel like dirty topic dont know
thats appropriate oh
actually im bet neil know
called brownie there guy
there guy first talked
statistical observed didnt fully
understand mr brown weve
observed go window
dustier house better pull
curtain aside start see
particle move around
dont fall like rain bounce around
dust particle yeah dust
particle see
reflection dust air
know kind beautiful image
sight sunlight hitting reflecting
dust particle dusted apart
going say grandma ocd
like clean yeah let go
observation
know doesnt fall like
rain mhm einstein also relates
quantum nature matter say
fundamentally air continuum
look microscopic level
im going realize made
individual molecule molecule
moving randomly theyre
knocking theyre
bouncing around call brownie
motion bounce around
randomly theyre kind
constantly knocking banging
move around um
evidence quantum nature
reality early fact
think one first supportive
bit evidence atom even exist
thats right
word big use
air dust analogy
liquid solution uh
suspended particle thats larger
molecule particle
sort move around response
collective energy particle
around
calculate happen
liquid composed tiny
particle get
motion atom
constant yeah absolutely talk
thats better word talk
temperature room
time really
average thermal motion
awful lot particle
statistical behavior later well
predicted plunk
part early era starting
understand look glass
water continuum got
small enough actually made
individual molecule
fourth paper wasnt um e
mc² oh thats pretty good one okay
yeah could forget one
yeah yeah whole
paper wrote e mc
busy year except
didnt mics
drop
totally speaker
refrigerator drop working
patent office right refining thing
like refrigerator coolant
refrigerator cooling mechanism
bottom drawer desk
called physic department
physic department
working paper refining
people patent e mc² one
gorgeous result obviously
famous equation obviously
love result implication
went far beyond initial
motivation thinking
thats point whole far
beyond episode mean changed
world know many way
okay four result yeah
two stapled together
one nobel prize got
brownian photoelectric correct
right he got one nobel
prize two thing
eagle relativity let
alone general relativity come 11
year later whats
intriguing nobel prize
least interesting work he
done somebody win grammy
worst album well
practical practical nobel
always attached verifiable
result hard
stephen hawking get nominated
nobel prize surprising
even roger penrose
nominated awarded nobel
prize theoretical
nobel prize often awarded
thing verified
experiment minute certainly
day thats intention thats
correct thats correct
idea youre
theoretical result could could go
wind right know whereas
anchor experiment
got got legit become
legit let
26 time turned 26 yeah im
38 demotivating
sorry im already 12 year pas
look u consoling
youre 38 okay mozart
age already dead
year okay dont mean tell
mom going happen
disappointment
einstein latest idea
still chasing cern building
future circular collider massive
machine designed explore dark matter
antimatter unknown edge
physic ground news analyzed 100

clearly today back show
let pick crumb
right let talk
cosmological constant okay whats
love cosmological
constant like guy couldnt
wrong like couldnt wrong
even terribly wrong even
terribly wrong
right somehow later would turn
right yeah one
crumb big crumb dont even know
going grow interesting
crumb later dog would need
give chance lap
put bed he leaving
yeah go look
einstein crumb actually youre
maybe maybe give got
invigorate idea well einstein
writes general theory
relativity go beyond special
related 10 year later okay yeah
take
kind want describe
space time relative
rotate space time
theyre one kind spacetime
also spacetime could maybe
curve stretch mutable respond
matter energy around
earth reason apple fall
tree following
natural curve space created
mass earth general
relativity generalizes
theory away flat spacetime
curved spacetime
still cannot predict everything
theory suggests
abundant abundant today
people still trying find
solution theory describe
universe people came
number different scientist
around world international
experiment quickly
next couple year said
know theory predicts
universe expanding people
studying theory theyre
imagining average
distribution galaxy
stuff smooth
imagine pretty smooth
say spaceime
mutable response distribution
energy would sort think
well lot gravity mean thing
going recolapse everything mass
know going pull
towards going
cause collapse universe
case universe shouldnt
static stable permanent
einstein really resistant
idea like
say must made
mistake fundamental equation
general relativity describe every
possible scenario universe
add something called
cosmological constant
technically mathematically
consistent einstein law
youre completely thorough
would included term called
cosmological constant
magic term doesnt know
physically doesnt know refers
term known form matter
math representation
idea actually
applies reality yeah also like
idea like throw
like dont know
theory right there
magical extra thing right
knew mathematically
consistent thats exactly
legit said look maybe nature
produce energy density thats
uniform across space time
absolute constant
different property actually
push universe outward
tune exactly right value im
going balance thing universe
collapse
permanent exist
way forever universe
anything right ow
doesnt owe right universe
got somehow stabilize yes
stabilized universe
cosmological constant go
universe thats
permanent lived forever last
forever fast
quickly people study mathematics
say unstable
basically stood pencil
tip top hill said
stable mean
second quickly want
fall begin something
itll fall one direction
two direction
case collapse expansion yes
go either universe
collapsing expanding
want stay static uh
called greatest blunder
made lot kind mathematical
mistake afraid
really experimental
daring idea even called
blunder think
blunder intuition wait wait
wait resistance wait wait
blunder blunder
put reluctantly
hubble come along later later
telescope came first yes
edwin hubble yes come along
decade discovers universe
static expanding mhm
okay thats one
sign thats one sign
dont even need cosmological
const dont even need
cosmological constant come along
say look universe
dominated cosmological constant
could measure
dominated galaxy
galaxy fact expanding away
universe fact
expanding um real shock
physical way understand
force pressure universe going
opposite gravity
way
philosophically expanding
know thats havent got
well get yeah
know time einstein first
especially 1905 mean
didnt know galaxy
mean imagine knew
milky way little
island hundred star
night sky mean
imagined mean wasnt
hubble identified
object really
first galaxy
moving away
essentially average
looked like universe fact
expanding point doesnt
need cosmological constant
declares greatest blunder
fast forward 1998 right
discover
cosmological constant operating
universe measured win
nobel prize
god damn
plus dont give youre
dead right dont
dont announce might happened
unless youre alive die
announcement award
ceremony youre okay youre
still
hold got hold
announcement yeah die
still get award youre dead
right sense
reject blunder becomes actual
measurement get nobel prize
making measurement
reason measure even
though static might think
oh could measure
made universe static something
actually unstable
really want kind
dominate energy density
universe kind slowly waines
constant eventually
peak others dilute
away doesnt go away
eventually there permanent feature
background permanent feature
crazy empty space right there
way energy empty
space energy empty space
eventually dominate property
universe
dominates drive universe
expand expand
accelerated rate faster faster dark
energy ive heard energy
npc realtor
walk around say
feel feel there nothing
yet feel
energy sell air right right
exactly maybe charge
extra dark energy yeah
air right dont give idea
10 22 year
long time thats pretty long
time pretty long time
calendar um dark energy
become dominant expansion
become
accelerated fabric spaceime
cannot keep rip
well thats dont want
alive called big rip
thats go unchecked big
rip still human
far figure way
rip right itll rip
structure fabric space
cosmological climate change like
theyll know like
happen instantaneously feel
slowly start happen like
theyre know certain
time know start seeing
around stuff start flying apart
oh yeah look face like
going happen lifetime
here great great great grand
maybe dont know one okay
predicts based general relativity
mhm alignment
two object one get lensed
around get called
einstein ring two object
perfectly aligned together
curvature space take light
spread perfect ring
would see ring around star
night sky another star thats
exactly aligned behind here
problem mhm back universe
composed star star
small distance would
never get exact alignment said
probably never get observed
discover whole galaxy
universe longer
point light galaxy whole
field many place
behind galaxy still
phenomenon see gravitational
lens time yeah
see around black hole thats
detected black hole took picture
black hole light
behind went cast
shadow black hole there
space went around
office went around
went
around like north
one predicted
assumed would never found
lifetime like im
graduate school wed discover
gravitational lens cuz people found
object hanging side
said little
distorted whole arc whole
arc took spectrum
exactly matched spectrum
object side thats
splitting light around
object thats another little crumb
fell dude plate okay
tell black hole
yeah well black hole also predicted
mathematical theory
einstein predict well
know there said abundant
endlessly productive black
hole
crumb yet shaped crumb yeah
go equation
decide want think
describes every possibility
imaginable put matter
energy space time
curve could couch
curve spaceime great question
scientifically one people
arent going spend time
one guy decided know he
russian front world war uh
carl yes die front
died like six month
think there correspondence
einstein sends said
found simple solution
equation die front
busy writing letter
einstein know paying
attention bullet hey buddy
youre front yeah um yeah
think contracted infection oh
quite dire lot people back
died nonbullet injury
related yeah
said imagine thought
experiment imagine took
mass star crushed
point could planet
could anything
youre imagining mass
center point dont ask
nature would thing dont
even think schwarzel believed
way nature would thing
certainly einstein didnt math
sound described curvature
spaceime youre far away around
star earth get closer
closer mass still
front eventually form
event horizon even light
escape thats really mean
surface gravity get higher higher
yeah get mass
always front think
like go inside sun
gravity drop im
leaving mass behind oh
youre vaporizing vaporizing
complication right right
always say know black hole
much benign people give
credit youre right star
incendiary right right black
hole get real close
cant get call
schwarz solution einstein
equation yes schwarz
yes dy nobel prize
still amazing
result einstein doesnt think
theyre real say beautiful
help get published couldnt
believe simple solution
came quickly within six
month nature would even allow
yes thought nature would
allow yeah could
something arises prevents
catastrophic collapse matter
right mean staring
guy yeah well try crush soda
nearly impossible get
past certain point hard
hard crush thing
there matter force resist
right thats soda soda
could otherwise totally crush soda
okay clear like
demo want see
point cant make black hole
black hole right right right
atomic force
resist share
quick story im dinner
stephen hawking nice flex
talking isaac newton
mhm figure
solar system stable using
equation okay turn
solar system here sun here
like earth going around youre jupiter
every time go sun
jupiter youre saying im big
im saying youre gash ive
ive working ive working
get mar im saying youre youre
bulbous gaseous earth come
around feel would tug
little youre closer
right come
back around feel little tug
little tug knew
continued earth would fly
orbit thousand million
year would runaway
destabilizing force going
solar system know said
said god must step fix thing
thats badass
said know equation
thing see stable solar
system okay late 100 year later
100 year later llas come
formalism branch develops
others develops branch
calculus mhm demonstrate
little tug multiple
little tug major system
cancel called pertabbation
theory branch
calculus dude invented calculus
right yeah cant cant
figure asked hawin said
come didnt figure
cuz else going ask
stephen hawking right
waited long time yes
thank went
conversation right he like
entire eye blink he
assembling answer wow must
20 minute 20 minute later
said something simple brilliant
said cant think
everything took 20
minute type cant
think everything said
beautiful went
say follow einstein
come black hole thats
right cant think
everything cant think everything
said thats comforting
actually mean entire industry
scientist since still working
einstein equation got another
one okay wrote research
paper stimulated emission
radiation extraordinary
result kind
inside appreciate okay ill
tell ready
atom energy level
electron hang
discrete energy level cant hang
anywhere quantum quantum
unit anything okay
quantized even solace
quantum think
quantum solid
marquee somehow yes
electron one
discrete level given
time higher level
left itll want deexite
back lower level shoot
photon
atom want excite
want deexite got
okay let go back atom
electron hanging
energy level send light
photon exactly energy
level thatll boost
going absorb take
okay going however oh
here discovers
bathe atom electron
given level photon would boost
also spontaneously trigger
deexite time yes
exciting de mean
photon
go boost gotcha
bath also deexite
there there classical
understanding okay
stimulated emission radiation
normally stimulate
absorbs one shine
deexites
okay thats weird result yeah
quantum result deduces using
math quantum physic okay
get well got
laser laser
say calmly laser get
laser pull hair pull grab
really interesting
history also maser
laser microwave
version joe weber
wanted study gravitational wave
working maser
completely overrun laser
full acronym uh microwave uh
amplitude stimulated emission resonance
something laser laser stand
get c minus one laser
stand look stare experience
regret oh good spot
like remember george castanza
laser pointer like
look seinfeld episode reference oh
hey guy good thats good
thats good let let
u call
laser acronym like
scuba fun acronym laser
light amplification amplification
stimulated emission radiation
three word
paper light would yeah sir
laser visible light
work kind photon
microwave turn easier
make microwave laser microwave
amplification stimulated emission
radiation
paper like he
taking crap right publishes
boot paper dont know
actually experiencing
brownie motion
brown brownie movement yes
yes uh thats
favorite crumb
crumb interesting mean
unbelievable technological advance
incredible everywhere yeah
amplification
emit light bath light
light emit light
brought around deexit
emit photon
almost self feeding light
emits light
absorbs loop
pump light way
right number molecule right
cavity oh gosh becomes
coherent tight beam
intense yes way getting
like incredible intensity
one narrow frequency range light
range yeah time im sure
saying skin peel
right like im going
little laser yeah mean
application laser oh god
pe people invented
laser think charlie town got
nobel prize wow
expect like walmart yeah
know checkout line yeah
yeah first laser
huge idea here
paper 30 year later becomes
device device get nobel
prize incredible know
town got nobel prize laser
invented 1956 57 einstein died
1955 mhm would close
seeing lake close close
going operate
cuz element
stop
said already 70
something said uh work
done really yes thought
classy scared
medical care
mean still combative
quantum mechanic im yeah give
quote one god
play dice god play dice
neils boore said back
another physicist einstein stopped
telling god kept
one several time talked god
god intention quantum
physic fundamentally statistical
describe unique
objective reality describes
statistical reality felt
bad einstein even though made
significant contribution quantum
physic feel like trend though
newton also like dont know
god
yeah bring god need
couple fast one
predicts general relativity
certain phenomenon produce
ripple oh yeah spacetime
continuum gravitational wave right
gravitational wave say look
earth curve spacetime
sun curve space time
earth fall around sun
system move around curve
move curve
modulate like wave predicted
something called gravitational wave
silent wave
shape spaceime
visible light pure
gravity light saw
something could see bobbing
wave path changed um around
moving object sun decides
know something crazy
would know eight minute later
wave got u think
right there cottage industry
rising astrophysics theyre
looking pulsar galaxy
pulsar fast rotating star
extremely precise timing
precise there gravitational
wave coming towards u passing
across field view see
effect turbulent spacetime wave
timing pulsar go
wave see
move across universe theyll
bobble around theyre like buoy
ocean yes theyll youll see
effect happens
like whoa wrote many paper
thought didnt exist
really struggled whether
go right dont know black
hole exist maybe well gravitational
wave really confounding whether
carried energy real
substantive way oh im
changing coordinate
physically real there physical
impact confounding
decade would write wrote
paper said exist
would accepted publication
space publication
sending press would change
entire paper say exist
space accepted
yes accepted going
print would change entire
conclusion rewrite paper say
exist want writing
another paper right right right
right decide maybe
detect kip thorne
guest show took
star talk he kip
thorne right moved mountain
kip thorne went home
office pasadena he professor
emeritus think caltech
talked interstellar
executive producer interstellar
wrote original treatment like
dream idea write
original treatment brought
christopher nolan realize
view wasnt way around
uh petition congress
national science foundation
agency lot support
physicist like
right
yeah build mhm first
gravitational wave detector mhm
built called ligo laser
interferometer gravitational
observatory ligo sensibly abbreviated
ligo made really
sensitive two
laser go right angle
wave wash earth length
one laser path change relative
make
measurement mhm bada bing found
first colliding black hole
deposited much energy
spacetime continuum would
wed chance measuring
yeah mean powerful
event humanity ever observed since
observation big bang
energy came
gravitational wave utter darkness
utter darkness yet
power greater star
observable universe combined
moment came
ringing space literally darkness
right could see
telescope think
love look face thank
he looking back forth
like im trying think
anything else would
powerful star combining im
stuck taylor swift travis kelson
star came together
felt moment
tectonic ship discover
gravitational wave mhm
nobel prize
discovered gravitational
wave using laser
okay crumb connected crumb
came together made big smorgish
board science physic nobel
prize everybody board
get amazing mean
dont didnt detection
essentially centenery
einstein
2015 year gravitational wave
paper oh man yeah thats einstein
something magic einstein totally
something janna
memory serf einstein big
proponent unified field theory
first heard kid
field mean field
didnt know field synonymous
force right
gravitational force electromagnetic
force day electric
force magnetic force
force
ive seen star war
maybe maybe figured
got one force know
uh work hinrich herz
others figured combine
electricity magnetism make one
force take word granted
used two whole separate
word electromagnetic force einstein
fail
motivating well weve
failed okay there
great success unifying
matter force quantum matter
force electromagnetism weak
nuclear force strong nuclear
force thats whole story matter
done completely sealed yeah
theyre there outlier well
electroeak theory combined weak
went electro electricity
magnetism weak nuclear force
right got electromagnetism
guy high school
right uh um guy high
school
steve weinberg sheldon glow
high
school who third one uh
salam salam right thats correct
three two
classmate high school
high school anyhow
something water
managed conjoin
electromagnetic force weak force
called electroak
okay thats creative
right well go
pretty magical say
really one force magical
something nuclear range
experience everyday
life separate force today go back
time there point
one expressed force
universe give u electroeak
strong force gravitation yeah
strong easily get even
though dont talk much
anymore mean easily
youd nobel prize
well there something called
grand unified theory
certain failure isnt like
ideal grand unified theory
really there nothing barring
possibility mean
obvious obstacle there
fundamental obstacle grand unified
theory people think going
come along ride
full unification einstein said
unified field theory thinking
also want include
gravity want gravity want
gravity want gravity
thing went special
general started thinking
quantum mechanic want
quantum theory gravity behaves
differently force
think gravity
even force falling
curvature space time
thats geometry geometry
really force could
barrier summing together well
nobody ever succeeded even
kip thorne
idea oh well mean kip
endless idea
think interstellar 2 yes
think kip ambition yes
universe would completely
comprehensible would mean
either understand quantum gravity
understand gravity
fundamental two kind
choice everythings quantum
mechanic dont know quantum
mechanic successful idea
weve ever anything
universe dont think prediction
ever failed
largest number decimal point
scientific theory history time
whereas general general relativity
badass know limit
like center black hole
singularity give
singularity equation
dont know thats say
god dividing zero youre
supposed divide zero yes
bad well even roger penrose talked
singularity nobel prize
recent year even paper
say dont really think part
going survive really say uh
quantum mechanic probably get rid
singularity
hasnt hasnt done
thing supposed around
gravity point crumb
crumb attention brilliant people
either walk among u yet
born im going throw
relevant wormhole
einstein talked einstein
rose bridge ultimately give
rise wormhole might involved
understanding thing like black
hole gravity arent fundamentally
real theyre sort embroidered
quantum wormhole
might really another one
einstein crumb embroidered
quantum wormhole thread
crumb einstein come
wow anybody keep eye
wormhole
scientist messian
eater speak anybody else
left isaac newton badass
okay fact think isaac newton
contemporary einstein
would done everything einstein
whoa im im newton guy
okay yeah youre youre real newton
guy yeah yeah got give
something yeah im newton guy
mean calculus pretty impressive
thats pretty good yeah like
dare like orbit
moving ellipsis rather circle
dont know let get back
im going eat apple
yeah let go back well here
well
well invent integral
differential calculus show
okay isaac youll indulge
moment need reflect
conversation
love
mathematics early
learned wanted
astrophysicist language
universe
mathematics thats
extraordinary fact
invented mathematics head
history math filled
example dont know work
let invent way calculate
figure work
thus rise arithmetic
algebra trigonometry
calculus
help u commune cosmos
make even
extraordinary start
idea universe work
cant manipulate idea
youre stuck using
word make mathematical
representation
idea manipulate idea
using perfect logic
mathematics
extend idea place didnt
even know idea could go
youre extending
perfectly logical
step map idea
world mathematics fact
work u
leaf awe
existence mathematics
human mind took u
like albert einstein
laying physical idea
universe work attaching mathematical
model rest u run
mathematical
model crumb einstein plate
leading nobel prize
level gone
boy eight nine 10
nobel
prize he sharing genius
rest u 20th
21st
century come einstein
crumb cosmic perspective
jana thank helping
thanks im always glad
podcast tell oh right
joy love joy joy
um thats beautiful
title yeah quantum magazine
story uh friend steve strogats
who original host show
uh quantum magazine
simon foundation wonderful science
magazine book called joy
x mathematician thought
brilliant title show
originally called joy x called
joy lex language
word there another one think
called joy sex started
yes okay yeah yes
original steve cohost
show lot fun deep dive
hardcore physic excellent biology
computer science good simon
foundation jim simon
successful wall street trader think
he wall street trader
ever he original quant
background math
physic brilliant mathematician
accomplished mathematician like
still use mathematical result
theoretical took ride
yacht called archimedes
thats thats classy jim best
right think justice
crumb oh gosh thank
much guy always fun yeah thanks
filling gap taking u
next step
harrison youre road
routine yes comedy
magic show uh weve broadway
im taking road im
