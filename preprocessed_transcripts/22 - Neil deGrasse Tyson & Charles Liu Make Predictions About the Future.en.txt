source well look um
people making
prediction writing example
fact influencers future
b past leave
alone future take care
well get sort
philos philosophical thought
first foremost mean
didnt predict future
groundwork new idea would

j made early 60
1960s set
2062 far away
future sit today
fast youve got flying
car there robot every house
mh yes place thats
thats case first
flying car um theyre
quadcopters theyre flying car
go japan youre going
find pretty much kind robot
every robot everywhere fact
jetson accurate prediction
near future
look place accuracy
found recently year
2020 looking year predicted
future already
past jetson think george
jetson triangulate based
certain script line born
year 2020 oh really yeah okay yeah
cool kind jetson
extreme baby ge jon pandemic baby
know know think 20
might 2021
somewhere window somewhere
thats first point here
think got wrong
didnt understand robot
anything something
wouldnt otherwise right task
task task he still flying
flying car doesnt push button
say take work car
work today way
rob bot run
home go car
take work right
missed fact robot
humanoid feature
isaac asimov ey
robot predates jetson yeah
okay ir robot robot humanoid
yeah thats necessary
assumes human form something
want emulate there lot lot
stuff dont well make machine
better im saying dont
think thought selfdriving
car form robot yeah
ever seen amazon uh warehouse
yeah full robot autonomous
theyre box yeah theyre
box moving around moving stuff
moving box theyre robot
right everyone know
theyre going going put
id thing
dont know robot
leave
could quantum thing right
secret life robot secret life
robot like youre looking
theyre looking like theyre busy right
look away right theyre
partying theyre back
cigarette
like love book
quantum handy quantum physic answer
answer book v yes series thats
first rodeo ive done handy
astronomy handy physic right
handy quantum like quantum physic
dummy well assume guy
arent dummy
see thats make mistake
thats biggest mistake quantum
physic harder classical
physic different strange im
trying tell people calling
handy answer book dont think
thing thats really difficult
think flip
like manual like riding
bicycle putting together piece
furniture quantum manual want
robot amazon fulfillment center
two quantum state one theyre
busy one
outback smokig came
fulfillment
center term dont know feel
right rob long time robot
robot warehouse um
warehouse become ful rob give
word sears robot catalog
hundred year ago
warehous nothing amazon thats right
human being
filling thing point
mid 20th century marketing decided
call instead warehouse
calling fulfillment center
idea uh think
sears um certainly big
stor time information mean
sometimes say thing
know sometimes fact checked
behind back please
youre
always youre always right point
say something like yeah 100 year
ago like get wait
chuck got per show reaction
go ahead know
okay early
show oh gosh dont know
one well think charles
keep going wa also also
maid rosie maid yeah shes right
first female right still
genderized robot sexist
little apron french
french sexy
robot look movie
generally youre thinking
major budget production yeah thing
dont always work take 1982
blade runner movie harrison ford
remember based dont know
yes based novel android
dream electric sheep philip k dick
yep well thank write
well early 50 right quite
early yeah set 201
9 original original movie right
movie yeah 82 much
doesnt land true none mean
hindsight obviously
perfect right uh youre thinking
humanoid offworld
replicant yeah doesnt exist didnt
happen replicants right thats
happen world
dont perfectly humanoid replicants
right sun sometimes shine right
however living dystopia
thing dystopian future
debatable yeah issue
dystopian future
assumes whatever trend line
culture civilization
continues descend without anybody
anything time
right public politician
military nothing
continues descend hit rock
bottom make movie
uh quick
happen locally theory
happens way
dystopian future
warning uh authoritarianism well
said thats thats st thats
authoritarian take
toilet thats right thats
thats like thats theyre
always written way here
interesting go thing going
happened blade runner
kind today right right
remember scene tense
scene one replicants who
trying pas human getting
interviewed someone who task
identify replicants
longer presenting
replicants replicants
good go
series question theyre
testing dilation eye
emotional reaction certain
situation oh yes sh psych profile yes
yes yes there point he
he like cant react way
human would would expected
point today people show
stuff written chat gbt im analyzing
dont tell im
analyzing human
emotion thats authentic
replicated something think
human im thing
yes right yeah conducting
touring test real time better
yeah really deep discerning
version discerning version tell
touring test tell everybody
turing famous guy right helped
create computer forth heing yeah
yes would important u
figure whether machine
become truly intelligent seeing
tell difference
response machine response
human without seeing
who behind curtain right
develop detail right
turing test general idea became
specific like example
thing youre talking right neil
analyzing text analyzing response
like blade runner sense
predictive strategy try
figure whether something
think whether test
much intelligence
consciousness depends yeah
going say different version
make machine intelligent
really make difference well
depends think intelligence
dumbass people computer
dumb as would mean theyre
thats im saying theyre
computer exactly dont get rid
dumbass people
stupid know cant
stupid
computer way
smartphones dumb phone like
moving anyway
bias intelligent
right judge person
stupid person still
intelligent there intelligence
person adapt person likely
conscious person likely able
figure puzzle forth
claim theyre stupid
somehow didnt get joke
told couldnt solve
math problem thing like say
comedian hit head
right thats measure comedic turing
test laugh joke
laugh joke dumb well
there episode classic batman
tv show robin batman try
test whether there robot
happened batman robin
told super funny joke robot
supposed laugh since robot
thats right trying test
whether robot
thing laugh ripped head
went batman told
super funny joke didnt
laugh knew robot
ultimate test chuck
colleague inell actual
consciousness punchline backman dont
recommend pulling head audience
member dont laugh
part story lik
around know something maybe
charles know uhoh know many
thing know let enjoy
moment got competitive touring
obviously call touring
test correct know called
remember ever know might
called im intelligent enough
called imitation game oh hence
name movie title
movie profiled life thats
awesome kira nly benedict
cumberbatch benedict cumberbatch oh
good lineup sherlock holmes got
watch movie never se ever
seen first ever heard
honest touring story
movie mean life story
becomes tragic dont give away
im ive let think
happy alert please else
go mean series like
historically twilight zone
absolutely pick interest
outer limit limit move
recently black mirror yeah
whats name charlie
charlie booker brilliant
contrast two think
leave emotionally spent
disturbed end also go
twilight zone day
look sort disturbing story
told didnt always
happy ending yeah ray
bradbury kind school need
think yes look rod
sterling comment show said
look well end day
selling soap right
sell soap way people dont
feel offended whatever say
said fictionalized world
thats clearly world
tell story people oh thats
happening world later
pause say wait minute
friend
neighbor thats behaved
storyteller par excellance
genre
especially like said
disturbing feature many
fast forward black mirror
authentic science fiction
future always foundation yes
highlight future
people might know
future black mir
netflix yeah believe netflix
third season fourth season
future highly techn technologically
driven driven everything driven
technology story
respond
technological advancement really
never technology
good uh always human
nature affected
technology one thing
little reach
imaginings future
prevails almost episode
share universe right like
news thats tv
news caster see multiple
theyre theyre world right
common
human mind accessible right
way hard drive accessible exactly
often meshed way right
way hard drive connected go
someone head rewind event
experience saw see
see eye pull back
manipulate right uh thats thats
whole frontier storytelling thats
unplumbed think
frontier storytelling
also different facet
reality way experience
something even though experience
exact thing totally different
way experience
blur line
individual reality collective
reality
technologically measured reality
brilliant look around
room im seeing everything
seen truck filter
filter im also seeing
human eye opposed like
eye know eagle owl
im also jordy jordy right
next going
cant see eye
like infrared meter know
reality exist time
though thats make
brilliant love idea
download brain put
computer everyones talking
black mirror make real yeah
scary see scary
see nefarious way people well
way theyll manipulate way
really explores darker side
human nature one favorite
episode there guy
think um he kind
accident he log cabin another
guy show he like hey man
he like kind nursing back
health think he injured
get
admit murdered family
crazy thing wow
find
simulation
interrogation police oh wow
word
punished leaving
simulation simulated hundred year
oh goodness would come
prison sentence thinking
uh prison 100 year
really prison
whatever time dilation mentally
maybe year
would thought think served 100
think future
possibility feel real
enough feel like headed
reason dont think
thing work simply
assuming intelligence
perception forth fully
controlled cant tell
difference reality
real already know brain
fooled right already know
technology going change
anything respect unless allow
happen dont think
adding technology uh never mind
idea whether intelligence
actually digitized right
quantum situation never
pas cuits uh digitize something
called cloning theorem make
difficult wind
circumstance going say
got stop got stop
man got bring back
cloning theorem cant
walk walk past walk
like drop like oh
here cloning theorem boom
right im moving like well okay
cloning theorem one many
different piece quantum computing
sort like law quantum
computing way isof
law robotics particular one
cloning theorem mean
quantum bit information
cant make many copy
youd like cant make copy like
u digitize photograph taking
little little pixel make
pixel exactly another pixel
hard drive usb stick
something get exact copy
previous picture absolutely right
cloning theorem say quantum
information cant anytime
wouldnt able
cubit opposed
bit bite able
soon read cubit uh
destroyed make sense
existed super position
yes right moment
actually realize super position
position made null void
particular instance thats
great way describe damn
damn
chuck give man degree
capture freeze frame
consciousness certain time
5 minute
afterwards would potentially
different one consequence
cloning idea right know
moment
cannot know next moment
moment moment
oh god thats right let
show
understand science
make awesome
make blew gasket im
sorry
reboot okay im sorry right
thinking
future thinking getting
thinking 50 100 many
year advance yes describ
star messenger exponential growth
life invention idea
understanding yes right
sort frame 30year gap
yes im wondering return
exponential growth need
know far away
vertical graph took
someone
1995 brought
2025 would completely
sort way today yeah let
tell definitely
case right okay would know
function right little thing
like sit restaurant
say wheres menu oh here
qr code theyll idea
mean
dont know social
medium
barely lucky barely
email address
rise beginning 199s
general public idea
would selfdriving electric car
road driver
walk around la car
place okay role
smartphone played life
beginning 2007 onward yeah idea
walk talk someone
something smaller size
pack cigarette someone
riviera wheres rivier french
french
french im describing yeah
way currently live take
granted would holy foreign
exotic unfamiliar someone
transported
1995 respectfully love
disagree
completely 95 2025
general 30year interval
specifically 1995 2025
star trek already saw
could jules ver
hg well lucian 2
century ad lucian wow yes uh wrote
love
lucien well actually uh uh
guy sort area
world time
fertile culture imagination
forth uh
second century know else
second century dont know
hady wrote alag guest think
coincidence thats period
laying univers people
charles named theyre
historic yes wa wait lucien
name thats name lucan
name person wrote credited
writing science fiction novel
called true story wow w voyager
boat caught storm
wind moon
moon creature dont look
like human theyre engaged
great war greek want
clearly people would
fighting well kind
thing imagined
long long time dont think
anyone 95 showing 2025 would
go oh gosh people talking
box theyll say oh wait happened
star trek okay work
tap tap tap
everything built human
human would able adapt
instead alien right right right
almost immediately
commonality human 1995
2025 okay let take back
let forget second century ad sure
time enlightenment let
go time darkness uh oh right
like
let go middle age
know mean dark age dark
age middle age dark age
go consumed
superstition everything squelched
term enlightenment
people transported
today way clear
would everything witch chuck
clear book localized
era industrial revolution
fully expect
invention change live
period one expected
great great grandchild
living differently
absolutely dont know
go far
back ill say
first understand
dark age term coined european
historian true fact historian
claim rome fell year ad
476 take account
know true people ran
area known roman empire
many different way century theref
holy roman empire
happened starting 800
charlemagne meanwhile
eastern empire based
constantinople thats right
concept way uh rome still
today thats right
summer beautiful place
hot still happening right
sense history right uh also
make u think predicting past
uh framed u
dark age actually period great
innovation people thinking
lot thing
necessarily europe arabic
speaking world thing like algebra
created thing like mathematics
yes chuck cant talking
brown people okay doesnt
count didnt happen europe
youre making point exactly trer
word never spoken see
point thing youll telling
pyramid africa get
right mean surely egyptian could
ever made must
alien egyptian arent
smart people look like
european couldnt geometry
use imagination
author filmmaker yes
kind replicate thing
came follow sl
sliding door first saw
star trek first saw star trek
yeah okay thing
shaping future position
past oh follow great
idea great point thats asking
never saw sliding door
future feature liv would
pursued would trying
open grocery store door holding
bag great question here
thought make prediction
time probably thousand
prediction future
literature um around
newspaper even written
people 100 year ago yogi bar
said hard make prediction
especially future right
make thousand prediction one
come true looking
backwards cherry pick
future show sliding
door go back go hey remember
sliding dont talk
anybody um predicted door would go
door would squirrel
exist know somebody
probably even though star trek
show didnt door door
swirled way
uh thought
didnt dominate society
whatever reason okay right let go
2050 prediction star
message way put
prediction 2050 people

happened funded taxpayer dollar
space tourism project
part didnt happen well
2050 yet okay dude well
think think get
protec price going drop
low enough people want go
space heck 30
year 30 year unfortunately
youre watching price
extrapolating outward future
dont see pattern
happening right whats
happening space still
controlled country government
willing subsidize private
corporation subsidy rem
country earth equity
space would hope
moment part
world dawn flight
expensive people plane
flew plane like
news cocktail party
attended everybody fly
plane figured
make cheap plane always
beginning 1903
private enterprise activity space
since beginning governmental

space shuttle didnt make money
money made track
start sentence word
fine im saying 2050
happen within
think okay thats thats
here think response
whats going happen
there lot money floating around
space really
let go
afternoon yeah looked wrong
place mining
mine whats instead
destroying earth bring back
precious rare earth well
wouldnt rare earth rare space
rare space bring back

propel advance
fast like gold rush like gold
rush people going go crazy
fast get get money
space tourism natural
byproduct byproduct target
byod happen often right
want read dont time
anyway want

orval yeah look war
take high ground took
another level pun intended um right
let take another look selfdriving
electric car go dont
think thats yeah yeah thats
thats limb thats going
breaking thats well people
say itll never happen
whatever people like driving
already hov lane right say
go
selfdriving car right
selfdriving car going 120 hour
three car link
instant reflex
theyre putting makeup
theyre texting theyre
could still car
made right dont
steering wheel going live
self drive
think faster people
agree think selfdriving
vehicle prevalent public
transportation right still
private transportation
driver still beary ab
listen youll drive back road
stuff like youll able
drive car okay one day wa wait
wait point theyll become
like horse yeah okay still ride

half accident happen
way dont see who
blind spot building
infrastructure highway
byway going expensive dude
went horse drawn buggy 1905
couldnt give away horse
1915 gas station paved road
automobile tire happened
10 year dont know youve
noticed lately thing bit
expensive yes still
million ofet want societ science
science side science still
million square mile north
america isnt highspeed
internet
got remember
regional solution right
extrapolate whats going happen
new york city driving
laramy wyoming fargo north dakota
likely driving
there la sunset boulevard 195 many
farmer still horsedrawn
tractor yes im talking
talking entire world
youre going talking
freeway system highway system
united state right going
limited certain area af neuroscience
advanced far understand
human mind well enough mental
illness cured youve also gone
developing antiviral serum
cure cancer feel
cancer yes absolutely
neuros science still kind
infancy high
expectation psychologist hate
say mean love
psychology neuroscience
alchemy chemistry
mean
love like hey listen like youre
one day youre
work okay know got
someone couch month
month month trying cure
illness neuroscientist said
oh nip tuck right
there neuros synaptic thing
tuck youre done
youre one
street crazy insane asylum
get implant
bypass point dont dont
know surgery implant
removable go back
original state let look ai let
look influence ai
world medicine u
getting vertical line
exponential line always look
vertical youre end
exponential always look vertical
like advancement happen
recent year want get
ai point extent
help medicine think one
prediction medicine
new prediction im
echoing whats already floating
around im putting tim stamp
medicine tuned
genetic profile zero
side effect yes make yes
one know
break hive dont
ingesting chemical there
something different genetic
profile hormonal profile
know understand side
effect thing past
thats one prediction
make prediction ill get
yes uh think happen
well able control behavior
well 2050 right still wont
able cure disease 2050
there lot think eventually
2050 yes okay issue
able technologically
say said good
thank say cool whip
depends im speaking totin
music
yes never like cool
quarter century well able help
everybody behavioral problem
solve behavior doesnt
necessarily mean well solved
disease would like
see mean theyll living
disease controlled
medication implant rather
removed entirely thats
opinion safe say going
forward future change
happen even quicker nature
exponential thats thats
point yeah there doubt
look pace patent
pace research paper doubling
time know youre
exponential theyve
consistent decade
mean year therell
double number research paper
subject field appeared
point thats thats
know youre exponential
caveat sometimes exponential
turn there period
exponential growth followed
leveling right example human
population thomas malus couple hundred
year ago predicted
exponential growth soon
many people world
enough food production ever
know prediction
here one could test 30
year 30 year exponential
growth human population turn
going top worldwide
around 10 billion stock yeah
thats gave wrong actually
start falling many place
already people already made
hold put cart front
horse oh okay mouth wrong
exponential growth
population level 10
billion he wrong applied
science farming
producing food less land
fewer farmer ever thats
wrong imagine
farm production would ever become
uh efficient voluminous
time
linear extrapolation
population planet wash
food anyone starving
world much food go work
third something saw
number anyone who starving
world doesnt food
feed there geopolitical
circumstance prevents nobody
like prediction good predic
last time credit brave
enough step yeah even got
critique moment give
one final prediction
something would like u know
see here prediction
going go dont confuse want
true likely true
honest assessment
desire good okay global
tipping point respect democracy
globally either going
people want govern
democratic process
sleep uh descend
authoritarianism worldwide
getting back going take
many generation none u
see gary prediction find
desire fully engage climate
change knockon effect
influence many global society
suffering climate migration
suffering rising sea level
bring desire
challenge tackle positively
think something
look step hope youre right
im sure
hope find desire
would great way little known
fact realized month
ago first saw steven spielberg
movie ai 1990s there
entire sustained scene underwater yeah
go underwater there
statue liberty completely submerged
yes already took climate change
limit time
movie supposed take place
side fact real movie
ai creating
cool man yeah take
extreme make example
make
think create future
invented year right whats
best prediction within 25
year professional sport
played orbit
wo satellite shooting shot headlight
look yeah space ball
go
laughter
like yes cuz know chuck
geek chief talk
sport oh yeah happens
first thing
