somewhere island
stable heavy element
californium slam california
different one yeah
exactly youre slamming unstable
element unstable element
slam california
alabama definitely going come
something
unstable god damn tell cant
believe came like
anything smell
good also kill ooh im
sure gene pool removed
specie long ago hilarious
music
star talk neil degrasse tyson
youre personal astrophysicist
cosmic query today mean
chuck house chuck hey hey
right got query
right come
uh come people
patreon nice supporter give
u money like
like theyre
curious well right yes
thats like
today going
chemistry nice love chemistry
know little bit chemistry
enough cosmic query
know enough listen
comb landscape chemist
weve went top shelf yes
top shelf found kate
chemist yes macallen 30
30year 30yearold scotch
chemist baby top shelf top shelf
chemist kate chemist welcome back
star talk thank
love visiting yall oh gosh let
get full last name
dont anyone world know
bieberdorf mhm married
wow dont blame
thats funny married
wow okay
husband scientist scientist
met grad school make sense
right right uh think
talked previous thing
meet university texas
yeah remember good
yeah high okay
okay
okay professor public
understanding science need
professorship 100 yes
know uh england several
funded uh
one microsoft guy uh
well one oxford sim simon
one oh yeah yeah simony charles
simone yeah he he he he uh
microsoft billionaire yes perfect
understanding also used date
martha stewart yes dated
went space oh
make food everybody
space station time prison
may
prison stint short
uh kate youre also
author host uh seeking
scientist yes find
seek yes seek
one every time least sometimes
least work every time
glad hear uh youre
notre dame yes took job
yeah oh new yep september
okay well welcome thank yes
welcome congratulation ill take
yes yeah year
ago gave public talk
yes proud institution
teach class theyre special
class dont teach right
couple year ill teaching
science communication course
going build science communication
minor hopefully turn
major
good collaboration
communication department little
bit partnership journalism
department yes art art
letter program college
going come together well
take expertise actual
communication expertise science
kind blend together
think going badly
journalism broken science
might way sort stitch
force help stitch back together
well know im even sure
journalism broken think
believe people siloed
extent cant accept whatever
journalistic uh point view
put forward cuz cant think crit
critically could go
hell man thats cool
said know uh
dont agree
becomes whole argument well
need somebody fix right know
think science way
actually bridging gap yeah
people learn science work
way thinking change entire
life got journalism
department involved good
teaching scientist
better communicator journalist
better scientist thats
clutch right
thats amazing
scientist excuse word get
bring come
thought fetch
im getting past fetch
important clutch love
right necessary
teach scientist communicate
right could number
different medium like podcasts book
written right journalism
science degree dont
care dont
trained talking public
medium really taught
talk right
taught write passive voice
dont know youve ever read
passive voice boring super
boring youre trying connect
nonscientist passive voice
answer right know
necessary able
talk scientist able
translate lay person whats
really important reason
dont know put um
dont want say
counter way scientist
people like son right
studying become molecular
biologist nice okay
happen didnt tell yeah
thats decided know
got full ride yes father
want molecular biology
howd happen thats want
looked life
like oh need something
get let tell something comedy
way go told
like dude thats great know
kind personality would
make excellent communicator
like yeah dont want
oh yeah dont want
talk dont dont want talk
people want
think lot scientist feel
way yeah want go
lab want dont want
talk yeah shut get
back lab exactly right well
mean scientist three
category first thing
ask question middle thing
seek answer
research last thing
actually sharing public
thats drop ball really
dont enough take
skill husband introverted he
great chemist he great software
engineer would hate
take certain
personality get put
also
thick skin people come
say yeah yeah
yeah yeah
office hayden
planetarium brings new
york oh im spot
today show
like
squeezed u
straight booty call
answered oh oh oh
wow youre today
dont need youre today show
well
like talking
question think kind
question different right
today show youre talking certain
audience american public
right theyre usually people
arent necessarily signing
science lesson
nice idea called audience
smart smart theyre
science enthusiast right wouldnt
say
important point already know
audience science
audience today show people tune
expecting science 100
slip
get excited thats goal
thats goal little fire
little little dance maybe teach
one thing teach one thing
consider successful segment
host today show
al roker craig melvin uh dylan
dryer oh cool always bring
got bring weatherman
know science always yeah
al great he actual science
enthusiast yes dylan
theyre meteorologist
science background
fun stuff cuz
ask question theyre
interested science
background want push
little bit love right
need need buddy
probably probably last
time came want
get question asked
million question
audience want ask
know yeah know
yeah couple fast one
kid like
burn hole carpet
explode kitchen like science
mommy kind
like girl nerd got
yes u
athlete soccer player
true love uh one
asked lot question
parent would count number
question would ask car ride cuz
drive nut um mom
helicopter mom
blowtorrch anywhere near there
chance would ever able
set something fire wow wow okay
could see sitcom
curious kid mommy daddy
daddy car
next scene youre
street
going leave im sure
thought positive
kindly drop museum
somewhere keep driving
yes thats perfect okay
shes helicopter mom freedom
still express
okay really
appreciate
younger made one bathroom safe
like chemical like
know like cleaning chemical
say food coloring
shampoo bath soap uh bubble bath
stuff cant kill stuff
cant kill put
big green plastic bowl
like go town say food
coloring removed first
time green end
think food coloring doesnt come
easily yeah well ive look
instagram ill show
face covered green food
coloring recently something
go wrong made youre
saying actually happened oh
happens time one
experiment intentionally cover
soapy green bubble um
come right shower
two face wash youre good okay
right aint
im willing thats
kate chemist yes
thats right like chuck give
u give u cosmic curiosity
let get right shall
shawn browning say
hello shawn browning im
coming hood river oregon hood
river yeah seesium
violent reaction exposed
oxygen
practical us average person
would know okay
periodic table periodic table
kind shaped like u cesium
bottom left hand corner
bottom left hand corner
biggest atom cesium
really big mean
positively charged core
nucleus electron
far away barely reach
electron big
charge separated
oxygen like take electron
neighbor exactly love
steal electron steal
electron thats book title
electron electron thief like
thats next book okay well
write together
yeah big
thats oxygen come grab
electron electron gladly jump
oxygen much much smaller
ea
see yeah yeah yeah
okay
reach oxygen
result chemical reaction
exothermic endothermic
probably exothermic would guess
really depends situation
like energy level
form ionic salt either
form seesium oxide cesium super
oxide either two cesium
one oxygen two oxygen one cesium
um form two two product
quite
stable oxide usually okay
look
said violent violent
reaction look like guess he
thinking throw
group one metal water weve
seen sodium youve
googled love sodium
water oh gosh sodium cut
knife metal cut
knife toss water
basically blow essentially
definitely thats reacting
water
dissolved oxygen reacting
process
happening electron
pulled group one metal got
right yeah
exothermic process like said
throw water mhm
part question asked
like thing
people might know cesium
cesium 133 think used
atomic clock happens
basically disturb atom give
frequency use
frequency measure time
exciting atom
disturbance usually like
push want get vibrate
move
little bit frequency
mapped keep track time
consistent
easily use like set
clock
exactly fact duration
second defined many cycle
cium atom okay many
vibration get second
cesium like nine decimal place
im sorry oh thats
atomic clock
precise right got
nine decimal place 1 second thats
pretty damn accurate yeah youre
good time pun intended
chuck stop
he roll he roll want
know precise right
vibration vibration
chemist tell u 9
bill192631770 cycle
vibration vibration
exact definition second
second yes go thats cool
add may
defined
precision second predefined
fraction year 1900 okay
involved earth rotation around
thing rotation earth
built definition second
wouldnt
60 second minute 60 minute
hour okay wouldnt
wouldnt meant earth
slowing speeding right
thered way know exactly
mechanism thats giving
second changing offload
onto ccm atom say yo
earth since
dont need earth totally dont
need youre acting
since 19 plus youre slowing
anyway since 1972 weve add 20
57 leap second right
account earth slowing
cesium adam look
cesium love love
dont know us though
really mean im sure
there one uh mean let
honest thats enough thats enough
could ask mean
seriously measuring time
billionth second come thats
pretty damn good right hey star
talk fan dont know know
audio version
podcast actually post week advance
video version get
spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk uh
uklid ohio uklid uklid
town called uklid there uklid
ohio ive never heard
guess im glad know
yeah uh say
gracious thanks using
question probably question
billion time ive never heard
answer weve
heard mentos diet
coke thing okay cool one whats
history thought
two cause chemical reaction
everybody put youtube make
video yes soda geyser okay
went back 1910
originally done winter green
lifesaver say didnt mentos
1910 didnt didnt
originally done winter life
winter green lifesaver green
remember oh apostrophe green
saver old yeah
go soda
like soda pop right
little hole center
would make really neat geyser
would come
hole middle
lifesaver yep 1990s
lifesaver company changed size
lifesaver science teacher
upset said right
throw experiment student
let figure replicate
lifesaver doesnt fit
science
committed chemist right awesome though
totally see high school teacher
grabbing student
grabbing candy soda
say right figure
experiment exactly whats special
surface mentos cuz
doesnt hole right
remember correctly there theyre
theyre solid candy right solid
candy nucleation
site like little divot
attract surface
attracts carbon dioxide soda
carbon dioxide slam
build pressure
shoot top found
diet coke best reaction cuz
highest carbonation okay
thought however thats
use diet coke oh please tell
otherwise okay didnt
think there part one
part doesnt sugar
big mess
mess right diet coke
hose sugar coke
evaporates everything gummed
thought main reason
one main reason
flight dont know fly
commercial still
flight excuse im
subway get
commercial fancy dont know
youre commercial okay
rest u flight
attendant go plane watch
somebody order diet coke
watch pour take
way longer carbonation
sink top
actually watch happen right
plane ride compared non diet like
like mountain dew coke
anything experiment
plus lower pressure
plane there there less press
co2 anyway there
bubbling action regardless yeah thats
good point check
okay please please right
mean soda maker
machine carbonator whatever
machine called cuz
one three
setting there low medium high
go high repeat
three time thats liquid want
probably experiment im also
going blow apart kitchen
made bomb
thank saying okay next
andy thousand oak ive heard
human nose incredible chemical
sensor detects faint
trace molecule also ten
thousand type molecule
question use fact
science chemistry aid work
way generally avoid
smelling experiment due unknown
noxious effect love remind
chemistry long time
ago dont actually stick
nostril top test tube
100
thing dilute
level know whether
get closer exactly yes
rule number one eat anything
smell anything drink anything
lab rule number two okay know
youre going smell let
teach safely yep
wafting youre pushing molecule
towards molecule
yes small portion um
think part question
asking like ever
ever use nose something
recently
people helped bringing two
beer performance stage
basically stage table
werent labeled one water one
vinegar immediately stuck
nose right tell
difference
able experiment without
doubt anything use
use nose protect
way u know whether
chicken bad good anything like
tool use
youre safe chemistry
lab anything smell good
also kill ooh im sure
gene pool removed
specie long ago hilarious
thats fair question fair
question right yeah sure
something smell good
kill u cant think anything
top head right
one mind
opposite know hydrogen
sulfide okay especially deadly
level well level
detect smell
say nasty im going go
opposite direction still
far killing anyone who
know hydro sulfite like
rotten egg fart fart okay
going say rotten egg fine
everybody know fart youre comedian
fart joke listen
thats first time got trouble
chemistry right made made
hydrogen sulfide took
put eye dropper went
around putting people
would smell like fart
yes got teacher
said know trouble
really yes
comedian thats
said wouldnt
gotten trouble
kept dog student
get aggressive anyway
yeah there uh there
suspicion evolutionary past
uh there there idea
hydrogen sulfide build
bottom ocean ocean uh
oxygen cycle stop
anorobic life form okay hydrogen
sulfide one byproduct
build big
enough bubble itll come
youre shore happened
liked smell fart
would go die
sort didnt care died
didnt like went
hill argument
happened frequency
history specie interesting
built u thats
interesting hadnt heard
thats interesting uncle
said pull finger ended dead
somehow still somehow
evolution never ant
uncle
guy gene carried
forward right right give
john say
hello dr tyson dr kate lord nice
john arkansas used teach
high school chemistry still
right teacher applause uh still
struggle electron configuration
especially transition metal
section
periodic table make dogone
convoluted yeah
called transition metal cuz edge
theyre pretty clean clean
understand got gas
noble gas got
know go middle
representation table
different yes right
others series
pull whats whats
whats one
reason make cleaner
rest u learn
try um one reason
transition metal called transition
metal go
different color change
actually see transition
oxidation state maybe
theyre plus two plus three
see color change across
table okay yeah could sit
watch reaction go
ill make color blue
green red youre watching
go different oxidation state
actually monitor
organic chemist
usually like color change thats
one reason drawn
field work
transition metal high school
also taught general
chemistry first year college
chemistry um general trend
say something like
operate like try
identify trend block
p block outside area
periodic table really follow
trend middle block
transition metal dont really follow
trend sound like prison
block getting
okay thats whats hard
teaching especially high
school like
typical trend go gotcha
general rule general
trend go um
there certain one always break
rule like jewelry metal
copper silver gold always
theyre im going nerd
theyre usually d9
way electron fall go
d10 redistribute
electron cannot get excited
im sorry
explanation sound like boy
band right oh used
d9 im d10
inorganic flaring talk
orbitals electron
love part
electron sitting
move around stable
let say five orbitals
there 5 orbitals two
electron one knew
five orb knew yeah
totally knew two
electron one provides
stability two two two
one less stable
take another
electron move
provide stability specific
atom like copper silver uh gold
naturally thats
confusing high school
student dont usually teach
exception grownup
grownup yeah everybody
true he high school teacher
pull back yeah okay cool
cuz
astrophysics nine 10 atom
universe hydrogen yeah
there nothing easier hydrogen
energy level dont even
think orbitals there
there layer there
level electron move back
forth
electron cloud get way
complicated realistically described
complicated yeah really
hard figure
orbitals actually going
overlap going
complimentary bonding
nonbonding antibbonding there
different molecule
space theyre
sort astrochemists level
astrophysics
completely ignoring turn
thats kind interesting yeah
say
leave right would
meant yeah okay
chuck else right
mi date think uh mihir say
hey kate neil chuck uh
book complex topic like quantum
physic baby effective
think book graduate
level science topic introduced
formally elementary level
engaging understandable way
cool experiment seen school provide
mon momentary excitement dont
leave lasting impact book however
might high school age kid ship
already sailed grab attention
say tell u
book first okay
seven childrens book five
little kate chemist shes
10 year old run neighborhood
shill plant
didnt thats mother
mother thanks mom teresa
go ahead five five fiction
book two nonfiction book
one adult called
elemental write try
share science general public
try make fun kid
book want
yeah yeah definitely
two nonfiction book
25 experiment home
material probably already
craft drawer
want parent pick
book use spring
break science experiment
kid okay go thats
cool work love okay
seems yes think
experiment lasting contrary
claim question
experiment yes come go
trigger curiosity yes
whether fully understood
chemical uh uh reaction made
happen dont forget right
think educator
overvalue lesson plan relative
inspiration think
research actually support youre
saying also
connection
scientist show one time
explosion okay fine maybe
youll spark interest
keep going back form
connection student
form bond thats
actually make difference
showing really value yes
push back quantum
quantum physic baby
said quantum physic baby
effective think astrophysics
baby there series
book mean baby
theyre talking actual baby
theyre board book flip
theyre really small
think primarily
parent cant read another book
cow go moo
intellectually stimulating
parent better parent uh
end day exposing kid
vocabulary good
get science class
theyve exposed theyre
hearing word molecule first
time already general
understanding maybe
maybe hunter columbus
georgia saw neil week ago
gave public talk
columbus georgia wanted ask kate
question periodic table
island stability real
kind property think might
able expect atom oo
talking island
stability neil wanted
point saw couple
week ago yeah something
think really interesting
chemist im familiar
band stability island
stability little bit outside
reach band
throw island sure unless
theyre thing call
something different yeah whats
band stability band
stability basically another uh
boy band name band stability
actually would cold play okay
right
okay kate got
band band stability
um figuring ratio
neutron proton make atom
stable 20 proton
fewer ratio 1 one
20 proton number alters
little bit uh chemistry
specifically atom 15 neutron
every one proton give
stable atom thats think
island
stability come extension
oh yeah okay uh tell
come learn
maybe dovetail
described certain atomic number
mhm nucleus large every
one unstable ask
well make stable element
stable forever
year minute right
might practical definition
call stable purpose
big atom live long
one discovering know
101 102 103 limit
table school uh 103
laorencium think still
still still thank turn
calculation stability
nucleus go beyond
one currently discovering
120 30 somewhere
forgot exact range somewhere
island stable heavy
element oo get
past unstable one typically
make another element cramming proton
neutron preexisting
californiaifornium slam
california different one
yeah exactly youre slamming unstable
element unstable element
see another unstable element show
live thousandth
second slam
californium alabama
definitely going come
something
unstable bam tell cant
believe came like
alamium
oh got one yeah
well done liberal tell itll
color purple though
see thats get
described physic
island stability
appetite wetted
new element
stable going
property
happens
chemical side physic side
yeah right island
stability saying
know like whatever last
less second right
saying organism thats 118
18 thats highest one know
right highest numbered one
yeah um guess im curious
would atom
stay around talking second
talking year like
think understanding
theyre permanently stable
would mean rule either
new manifestation
heavier nucleus uh somehow rule
show okay
cant wait till get right im
really intrigued cuz im curious
like relative stability
last maybe second still
instead thousand second
right right yeah couldnt still
wad hand thats
im curious right
ever wanted one
question universe answered
question
universe black hole quazars

earth always keep looking
jessica hello dr tyson lord nice
dr kate jess toronto
dubai well lie dah
jessica anyway
say people show theyve
let
listen got havent
dubai im going give
im probably person
hasnt dubai havent
dubai okay okay ive several
time well knew
well
uh space there oxygen
gravity minimal chemical
reaction especially combustion change
atomic level could studying
reaction vacuum reveal new
insight quantum effect like wave
function behavior molecule bound
bonding energy transfer quantum
mechanic say everything
probabilistic tiny chance
candle would light mess
thank neil love
way thats different kind
probabilistic go ahead
separate two area there
air
two molecule might perhaps know
others existence quantum
mechanically
entanglement maybe little
bit one
zero g zero g combustion fun
tell tell u well whats
interesting zero g
reaction behave like gasphase
reaction dont gravity
right get kind
stuff couldnt earth
space
move thing around expand
like pencil would never float around
earth would stay
bottom beaker right thing
whereas youre trying put pencil
beer well im im trying
give solid give
random molecule people might know
visualize pencil
beaker right pencil molecule
pentlecule yes staying
bottom beaker know
going sit going
bottom interaction yeah
whole time go space
move around solid
essentially get behave like
gas chemistry
different get look um
question combustion
reaction outside earth outside
international space station
mean oxygen
combustion right yeah yeah
guess um really
referring accurately
portrayed movie gravity okay
small fire began mhm
let go
extinguished
normally earth
there
1g heated gas rise right
bringing fresh oxygen continue
combustion create yes
ate oxygen
oxygen town co2
whatever byproduct cant feed
flame snuffed wow
cant burn candle zero g
point unless gentle breeze
right something moving
uh oxygen molecule way
right thats cool
right right mean
know didnt know
love way
cannot romantic space
anything combusts
assumes moving
material burn whole thing
right piece paper burn whole
take granted
relying hotter gas less
dense rising yeah right
ever try think
experiment really thought
chemistry
happens earth im terrified
leaving earth thats usually
stop love chemistry
earth okay
needed space consult id say
call someone else
happening go dont
scare wouldnt go
space dont know thats
line scare dont want
dont want youre flying
plane youre like oh halfway
rocket dont dont know
plane still one g
right okay right think
though could
different experiment space like
experiment womb
kind replicate
baby move around
zero gravity vibe
right theyre able float around
type experiment
space thats think right
okay there reaction
whats reaction could happen
zero g im curious well
there certain way could
could think taking
two different like solution
drop come collide
wouldnt able
create many reaction right
theyre floating thats
amazing unfold
right front solid
rocket could inside like
whats solid rocket solid
fuel isnt yes
combination solid
rocket booster yes go
like bang fuel
solid thats called solid
rocket thats call solid
rocket generally there
another tank thats im
talking oh oh okay
tank yes hydrogen oxygen
right liqufied way denser
air okay take
hydrogen oxygen take u
got tank twice big
holding liquid hydrogen half
size holding liquid oxygen got
keep really cold theyre
liquefied right thats
ever see launch ever see
ever see slowmo rocket launch
florida see chunk ice
falling rocket florida
moist environment rocket cold
moisture gather
desert youre
going condensation freezing
right cool okay tell
whats happening combine
subject space
liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen
wave hand say yes
make water there energy take
traditional
combustion reaction traditional
youre talking source
fuel carbon associated
treat oxygen
produce water carbon dioxide whats
really neat would give
energy yeah release energy
exothermic thats anything
burn basically anything organic
burn yes thats turn
black done lay
bare carbon yes yes okay
perfect remove carbon
combustion reaction
thats much cleaner thats
youre talking
hydrogen plus oxygen give u
water itll still combustion still
combustion uh
cleaner kind exhaust
rocket
water water go
go
thats awesome thats
neat think quantum
physic two molecule see
make contact see
way say want get
little closer mean always
music
mind chemistry driven
around rearranging atom
thats driven electron either
electron repulsion attraction
thats think interaction
electron
attracted would
cool two entangled particle
made entangled molecule wouldnt
weird whoa would
wild would
weird one molec one quantum molecule
bit separated right thatd
weird would weird
identical mhm maybe
hydrogen make molecule h2 lot
oxygen nitrogen breathe o2
n2 theyre quantum entangled make
one molecule thats scifi story
right wow really
weird super cool okay right
right go alyssa
youre kate earth chemist thats
future book coming
right alyssa feldos say hello
alyssa rocket city hunt alabama
daughter amelia olivia love
uh question
biggest impressive kidfriendly
experiment four
8yearold keep
interested science year come
love good bang arent afraid
getting dirty wow okay thats
thats full cart blanch thats
loaded one cuz fouryearolds getting
bang make nervous um
think adult involved
could exploding paint
experiment really fun sound
good
know hey fouryearold
adult
paint way said yeah
everybody know exploding paint
picture could help
set adult would
actually trigger reaction
simple need paint
empty never paint put
inch baking soda
bottom take cup plastic cup uh
fill vinegar food coloring
thats flavor nestle
cup baking soda
vinegar vinegar yep
liquid put uh
cup vinegar baking soda
like nestle like sand castle
youre going put lid
paint use mallet hammer
shut want completely shut
place gas escape get
kid go far away
put safety goggles adult
also safety goggles always
safety goggles yeah shake
keep head back
happen neutralization reaction
youll release carbon dioxide like
talking earlier
mentos diet coke yep exactly
lid fly really
colorful cute wait minute
doesnt sit
afterwards right cant hold
thing yeah put
yeah good point well know
blow happens
fast go shake
shake shake slam
table step back
move next one im
shaking second one first one
go wow
doesnt thought paint
lid stronger know
think paint lid tight
especially mallet shut
apparently match co2
exactly cuz secured
locked clamped
exactly co2
molecule coming going lid
shoot straight air
fun wow love one
happens second yeah
reason put
small plastic cup keep separate
long enough hit lid exactly
otherwise escape
expanding gas escape
get mallet
nestle like
keep everything separate mallet
mix bang
throw first liquid going
go slam
one time shake
actually really nicely distributes
vinegar grab baking
soda get cool acid
based neutralization reaction
right pumpy keep head back
keep head back cuz could get
hit face yeah see im going
let kid old kid
money
maker dont care old kid
dont matter
cant panc blown
like sorry baby pay
pay mortgage
shake put
quickly possible cant
overstate need goggles
experiment yeah
usually wear goggles lab coat
glove little overkill
sometimes like set good
example would break heart
kid got injured something
watch gotcha gotcha right
hello dr tyson dr beverdorf
lord nice james denmark
would say promising
development applied chemistry today
oh man
claim material scientist
community oo yeah
thats chemistry chemistry
chemistry usually branch
inorganic chemistry well
bailey wick yes thats favorite
guy awesome whats
horizon oh there many
different thing right one
thing im really interested
bonding ai kind
trying use help u
one thing read
asked microsoft ai um could
replace lithium lithium
ion battery took week
came answer
able hamster hamster wheel
thats thank ai brilliance
exactly answer
use go troubleshoot
see work im
really interested right
two world kind merging together
use better
research effective research
thats thats whats happening
right really excited
thats ai best yeah
ai think fascinating looking
molecule easy ai like
know well lot information
pull together everything
think term use
term think think term
future combination could never
even get would time
get calculate
arent book
chemical potential
reaction oh talking
crc yes know one
huge book oh
stand uh something rubber
company mean consolidated rubber
company true
compilation
property discovered
peacemeal assembled
volume scientist crc
shelf whoever
company decided compile
information could ever want
science go okay know
found auction u crc
birth year bought
slice time
knew chemistry
physic bi science
including math okay here
point thousand page
would take lifetime read
ai could ingest
come two minute chemical
wouldnt couldnt right
best world right
list word
chemical potential
likelihood two atom come
together whats well
atom electron cuz potential outer
electron yeah usually potential
talking activation
potential whatever sure activation
energy energy know
book youre going
sit read thousand thing
come new molecule let
let
beach sipping pinina cola
get notification
phone found new
youve looking
say ai write paper publish
like best grad student
could yeah funny
right said primarily
basically true there
understanding chemistry without
physic there understanding
biology without chemistry come
table physicist
look world see interaction
matter motion energy
biologist see interaction
life yet chemist situated
two go inorganic
molecule selfreplicating life
there complex chemistry
involved fact biology
complex form chemistry know
everything
around u everything made atom
molecule take much
granted somebody point
past thought
atom would
brought together make solid object
make liquid object make rocket
fuel make th ice pack
shake put injury
one turn cold turn
hot chemist middle
