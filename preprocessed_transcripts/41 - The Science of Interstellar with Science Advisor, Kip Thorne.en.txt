here einstein predicting gravitational
wave laying foundation laser
100 year later gravitational
wave found laser yes einstein
kind
smart time first started
working gravitational wave
succeeded 50 year thing
take long time build
none
smart enough nobel prize really
belongs thousand people
see farther others cuz ive
stood shoulder giant whove
come thats nature
science promising uh
going continue next
generation ultimate success
probably star talk im host
neil degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist today featuring
one oneonone con ation
time professor theoretical
physic kip thorne kip thorne welcome
start talk pleasure
neil oh gosh uh coming
home office pasaden california
wonderful office son designed
part house built
brother designed build
furniture really useful people
family wonderful
family
theyre practical one ive actually
known time
beer drinking buddy think weve
drunk beer together canary
island yes okay okay stand
corrected uh first exposure
one three
author book called gravitation
used joke course
book learned
carrying
around think probably wrote
born possibly possibly
uh although im older might
think uh book graduate level
treaty basically einstein general
theory relativity time
acquired paperback
tough making paperback
thick exact proportion
manhattan yellow
page used call
phone book yes uh affectionately
may may add brilliantly
conceived dont know
notice camera uh tab
different color say white black
represent two different path
book one sort
elementary path one
advanced path except looked
advanced time whose idea
come book
coming book think
sort grew discussion uh
charlie misner john wheeler phd
adviser year
three coauthor three
coauthor uh sort grew
organically uh thats best
kind yes project 1960s
early 1970s mh yes born
60 oh
really
uh uh charlie misner who
university maryland yes
copy sign
spent year teaching
university maryland quickly went
office sign
uh started
graduate school university
texas john aral wheeler
stole princeton think
princeton think
yeah thats accurate
statement three
sign fact john wheeler course
taught general relativity
met wife wow yeah
phd mathematical physic met
relativity class thought id say
romantic place meet
know romantic romantic
john wheeler used give uh penny
caught error committed
front board one
penny dont remember
big thing like typo
something wr written
version typo um uh anyhow
delight uh meet
prompted
uh know lot
accolade course including nobel
prize okay importantly
science adviser
film
interstellar science
adviser yes
executive producer
executive producer grew
treatment linda opst
exgirlfriend mine oh lind big
producer scifi film yeah big
producer film wide variety
linda dated 1979 80 uh
uh high strung
nerdy became close
friend wow know
didnt know stop
didnt would one learn
need gossip physicist gossip column
right yeah year
later carl sean uh set u
blind date way thats met
okay year
later linda called said would
like brainstorm
movie wow uh thats
interstellar born
time really creation
nolan brother took
given uh
basically structure uh venue
movie warped side
universe ran
changed story almost completely
made great film dont
seed came lindon
time mean youre youre
professor caltech richard fan
professor caltech emeritus cch
pretty high level place
viewed say guy hold im
going make movie
received colleague
uh think enthusiastic
bch different kind place
stuffy un
oh okay okay never hung much
caltech couldnt judge mood
tone yeah look edge
hollywood uh hollywood folk come
know big bang theory
based calch right call calch
call call calch
first uh episode okay
stopped using calch name
shirt thats hollywood
speak attorney oh yeah
stiff shirt yes yes office
shirt got scared might
something screen caltech
shirt wouldnt like caltech
shirt might sue hollywood
shirt stopped using caltech
name film
adored um whats called real genius
yeah real genius pacific
tech right
smart kid course pasaden
like cant say foothill
hollywood
proximal awareness huge industry
know science fiction
matter genre well
u love love im im signed
every time uh
interstellar uh think introduced
many people
authentic gravitational physic
first time well ander celler
unlike almost film think
precursor 2001 contact
yeah carl sans contact carl sans
contact point
science lot science baked
film beginning
way born
close close collaboration
nolan
brother buil right
beginning baked baked
science uh guid line
worked uh nothing
movie would violate
wellestablished physical law
wild thing would least spring
science manner good
science fiction story
there enough well there nothing
wrong fantasy uh film harry
potter style example
different genre way film uh
must known said okay
going help people
give guy break okay theyre trying
see movie theyre trying
follow whats going hell
happening guy get old
younger mother whats
going said let help
let help person yeah well
would put little differently
saw superb opportunity use
uh film motivator get
people interested intrigued
science would bridge
uh science book
admit created gateway film
gateway film yes science
interstellar yeah new york time
bestseller kip thorne forward
written course christopher nolan
say spoiler alert uh book
explains fantastic climax ending
interstellar let tell
came issue came
chris said early would like
make film ending
mysterious ending 2001 space
odyssey thats high bar thats high
bar greatly admires stanley kubri
film somewhat later
talking ending
lot conversation
ending said well explain
ending book youre
planning
write volunteered write
book
well already planning write
book uh identified
place eny get
explained going explain
would leave mysterious
film pulling kubric u
thats right uh fact uh
interviewed christopher nolan youre
archive diver uh weve got whole
episode christopher nolan even
interstellar uh produced
know many movie
play time kind
interesting way remember correctly
talk influential 2001
space odyssey back 1968
would yes um let
ask couple thing
story line
issue may know
dont know ever went public
figur im front man
issue
would youre gna youre
going get turned journalist
who challenging going give
tough time yeah got cant
cant
okay softball let play little hard
ball guess issue looking
planet theme
movie looking
planet like earth similar enough
earth send people
continue civilization
specie fair characterization
plot line plot line okay
turn there like wormhole
make happen little
faster otherwise dont live
long enough travel distance
rocket available hit
destination okay im thinking
blight crop starving
everyone earth requiring jump
ship literally jump ship go find
another ship another spaceship
planet seems whatever
effort take find another earth
travel wormhole ship billion
terraform ship billion people
whatever effort seems
bigger effort
telling biologist come
serum could fix crop even
today full knowledge crop gen
genome fix whatever go
nip tuck dna fix isnt
cheaper easier
faster worm holing way
planet thats thats im
coming think
problem solved human
human technology time scale
faith come im
optimist okay let let
describe characterizes
movie done
uh jonah nolan chriss brother came
idea wanted blight
something like said
okay bring together best
biologist expert
kind thing uh put together uh
uh mostly calch biologist uh
dinner brought
expensive wine drink
set recording vino
veritos okay truth wine yes
wine truth yes uh uh
conversation lasted
three three four hour
caltech faculty club aam
could would best
backstory two type
blight generalized blight
attack lot crop
different specie ofs lot different
specie crop generally
uh fairly benign blight
uh uh blight specific
particular crop
lethal blight uh may totally
wipe specie earth even
basically earth sur earth
life earth survive uh better
vicious generalized light
light according biologist
discussed didnt
know anything would prevent
development vicious
generalized blight thats occurs
movie something
biologist never seen
cannot uh rule rule okay
let repeat think said
said vicious lethal blight
attack specie less lethal
generalized blight cross specie
boundary cant rule
lethal
flight would cross specie thats
right thats whats happening
whats happening film
okay thats
biologist back there
ill give okay okay anyway
film full backstories
way
say unlike almost
film uh issue uh
like vetted vetted
world best expert process
writing screenplay okay
diving kip thor impressive
work one thing clear theory
reshaped understanding
universe might think latest
nobel prize physic would go
like thorne went computer
scientist instead contribution

another
one okay youre one one right
theyre black hole planet
okay uh see wave
coming okay miller planet
planet planet orbiting gargantuan
gargantua okay strength title
force highly sensitive
distance
causing tide highly sensitive okay
every illustration ive drawn
taught tide theyre peaky
theyre much broader
representation planet
waiting water
see single wave come
single wave weve seen
tsunami actually take water
away whats ahead
cant water nowhere
drawing water vicinity
two issue tidal would
peaky kind wave
could still leave water
laying around vicinity
big came
type wave called solitary wave
water could tell
brought wave people together
lunch talk
particular kind wave
discovered 1700s wow ive
forgotten physicist
england saw boat
pulled horse
starting created wave
traveled channel canal uh
peaked like wave
interstellar though wave
interstellar admit
exaggerated exaggeration
exaggeration peak
traveled channel
never
broke wave ocean break
okay get picture
talking century
ago uh see channel would
channel canal canal
there toe path side
people likely beast
burden would drag thing
canal cuz dont typically
current drag barge canal
barge exactly barge
dragged canal uh
starting created
wave uh startup
startup headed
took went channel
guy got got horse
followed channel went
got love curious physicist
nothing get went went
channel dont know mile two
uh without changing shape without
breaking without breaking
theory wave
two different
effect cause wave steepen uh
disperse two balance
stable sort way give
longer life give long life uh
aside issue friction
friction would
live forever keep propagating
stable way there
mathematics behind something called
cov de equation
solution anyway wave
equation presume
kind wave uh equilibrium somehow
represented sta w
dispersion steepening
steepening due nonlinearities
dispersion due fact
higher wave higher part
water travel faster lower
part water youre
ocean see little tiny wave
travel quite slowly see big wave
travel quite fast thats
crest wave actually
break rest wave get
part reason thats
right thats right unless thats
balanced dispersion
anyway love good good im loving
im getting slightly confused
anyway two two effect balance
produce uh
stable uh solitary wave
movie stable solitary
wave height
wave forgotten number
something like six time higher
depth water got
there problem movie
theyre walking around
shallow water wave high
got deep water okay
theyre theyre
island backstory
there always backstory oh theyre
subterranean sub surface island
yeah got read
book theyre theyre theyre theyre
theyre island wave
defract around island hardly
notice island
there explainable except
bit exaggeration
cgi uh wave made uh somewhat
peak somewh give
movie hollywood youre
saying wave might
caused effect
tital force black hole yeah well
wave caused fact fact
uh time much
slowed uh yes planet
planet uh put
orbit around gargantua long ago
seen uh
planet though long long time ago
seen far away
like mercury like moon keep one
face toward earth mercury cape one
face toward sun due tidal effect
planet distorted tidal
effect swinging back forth
yet settled uh one
face toward planet swinging
back forth generating wave
thats book weasel
another one
okay there enormous amount
science must missed
went book one
last point didnt study carefully
enough
one last point uh took show
oxford yeah recently uh interviewed
oxford think
postto name andrew mumy postto
showed u recent paper published
dont know youve seen recently
like within past 18 month uh
he radical physicist
alerted something id never knew uh
love field active
professional field vicinity
black hole innermost
orbit course orbit
source gravity even
black hole black hole
particular there orbit within
orbit longer stable
spiral black hole
according calculation get
time dilation necessary
scene black hole planet
huge remember
planet like 15 minute whatever
long 1 hour planet seven
year high seven year
spaceship okay guy left
like gray unshaven
everything like oh gosh
there serious einsteinian physic
going calculation showed
difference
extreme difference time
requires planet orbit close
black hole would unst
unstable zone
thought id tell calculation
say
otherwise wheres nobel
prize guy formula
book book yeah
dont go graduate
textbook well
answer okay want derive
formula thats lot work let
tell story behind got
story okay christoper nolan say
one day say
want uh hero cooper hero
movie go onto planet
cooper played matthew mcc thats
right professor bran daughter
played jessica jessica
chest chris christopher nolan say
say want movie
one hour miller planet 7
year high orbit back
earth prescribed said
thats impossible planet
fall black hole said go
real calculation ive already
learned offthe cuff reaction
wrong trust
unless real calculation there
good hollywood producer go back
give answer im looking well
well went back home
real calculation amazed uh
last stable circular orbit
talking uh
uh planet spin fast enough last
circular stable orbit high
high red shift high time
difference might wish
requires dilation requires black
hole spin extremely close maximum
possible spin book give
formula uh spin
black hole required
produce given amount slowing
time know
approximate formula
formula derived
though take take fair bit algebra
okay one one would learn
would probably lowest
stable orbit around nonrotating black
hole thats right thats clean
thats thats clean problem
clean problem thats thats
thinking
knew made
black hole spin would get closer
couldnt imagine could
imagine nature would
provide
orbit black hole spin fast
enough could provide much
slowing time
least unless made mathematical error
dont think thats like
used
mathematica okay tool help
check
calculation
analytic solution well
analytic solution
complicated complicated
okay well power series solution
end think hero
character inside black hole
come understand understand
access timeline
wouldnt otherwise available
see
daughter
bookshelf well he longer inside
black hole he
key thing thats
explicit understand
read book didnt read well
enough busted read lot
let say read read
biology long time ago
yes okay get inside
black hole uh scooped
spacecraft built
advanced civilization provided
uh wormhole uh
humanity called tess act
tesseract
fourdimensional cube four spatial
dimension thats
saw
uh guess past future kind
simultaneously felt higher
dimensional thats
right tess let back
ill tell
story early
working film uh uh christopher
nolan said wanted uh take
hero back earth cooper back
earth uh different route
wormhole 10 billion lot year away
earth hows going
doesnt go wormhole said
well want take back faster
speed light course say
chris cant violates
law physic say go real
calculation said dont
real
calculation discussed
week uh threw tow
said okay believe
said well uh put
go inside black hole uh
get deposited threedimensional
surface fourdimensional sphere
fourdimensional sphere
spacecraft go go bulk
higher dimension take
go black hole
horizon cant go
go fourth dimension
fourth space dimension
whats called fifth dimension
movie time fourth dimension
go back earth distance
back earth less
distance earth uh
sun even though 10 billion light
year inside universe
bulk short distance
get back quickly
higher dimensional spacetime
get back
quickly uh riding surface
four dimensional sphere said like
entirely except im going im
going use fourdimensional cube
instead four dimensional sphere
thats tesseract yes uh thats
happens see cooper
sort flailing around uh
beginning test scene he
carried test back earth
dont know thats happening
read book agreement
chris thats thats
way anyones ever going know
anyway he carried back earth
everything happening
cact docked uh higher
dimension beside uh giving access
life past time thats right
docked home
daughter bedroom okay
he pushing book shelf
land floor
clever cryptographic judgment he
spelling word first letter
title book okay here
issue problem tessaract
black hole fourth dimension five
dimension know title
book side book
dont remember thats he
actually uh he pushing book
know he push know he pushing he
pushing b side yeah yeah
see side
library
guess forgotten uh
spelling thing based first
word oh forgot forgot didnt
know youre youre
wrong one little
issue one dont
know oh okay okay dont know okay
youre youre three
four pro probably
probably photographic memory
side
book whats hear use
wormhole travel backwards time
math check
einsteinian physic check
mean show younger
version shake hand
mean
longer exist time left
younger version see
wasnt didnt hawking put
forth time
travel prevention conjecture
something whats going
outgrowth phone
conversation carl
sean uh uh working
novel contact uh triggered
start thinking
wormhole started
think wormhole became pretty
obvious rather quickly uh
give wife car le one mouth
wormhole carry high
speeed rocket ship space
back keep wor
mouth
home uh see age 50
year back earth well ag
one year going coming back
look wormhole
uh see aging
rate imagine uh hold hand
look others wrist
watch theyre ticking away
rate wor
wormhole weve aged rate
age uh looking
throughout outward outside
world normal universe
shes aged one year ive aged 50
year something weird happened
wormhole become time machine
go go mouth
wormhole mouth come ill meet
younger self okay hawking said
going allow
there
conjecture yet discovered thatll
tell cant well know
story get youre going
fast im going fast sorry
talked friend
university chicago physic
crucial talk friend tell
youre tell
made mistake straighten
pointed uh
might time machine
turned itll selfdestruct
basically said
said dont understand said go
calculation went
calculation issue
guessed basically
thats oversimplified bob gach
robert wald
chicago anyway turn
moment first time travel
f first thing go go
vacuum
fluctuation light say ender
mouth wormhole come
mouth go back arrive back
mouth moment
started twice much
place space time
runaway runaway
twice much
go around
four time much go around
runaway uh build like
feedback microphone
speaker precisely run away
run away run away
runaway show quantum
mechanical calculation
youre bumming dude together
san kim korean post mine okay
want movie director say go
hiip go home figure
give another pull another rabbit
hat well anyway
discovered stephen think one
stepen hawking uh student
think less
discovery time except step
probably head
way steven anyway uh
steven started corresponding
email talking
phone forth appeared
looking detail
calculation uh fact
explosion designed time machine
right detail explosion
explosion would strong
enough destroy wormhole uh
stephen showed
wrong argued back forth
finally came agree
explosion becomes strong enough
quantum gravity enters hold
answer tightly grip
wont know whether time machine self
destructs understand law
quantum gravity let obscure
come hawkins cosmic
sensor ship conjecture thats
called yeah conjecture
fact end law quantum
gravity wont save day wormhole
destroyed time machine
advanced civilization make
destroyed try turn
vacuum
fluctuation uh thereby hawking
say keeping universe safe
historian specie
reminds ultraviolet
catastrophe mh run
calculation going blow
even work outcome
discovery quantum save
day right could
calculation waiting another branch
physic open another
progress known branch
physic resolve loo team
perfected technique called quantum
precision measurement based
manipulating vacuum
fluctuation uh order circumvent
uncertainty principle
business manipulating vacuum
fluctuation something
modern physic memory serf carl
sean came said contact
want go far
distance quickly going
cook wormhole
carl uh
well back
80 he writing novel
obviously pred movie
thats right said wanted
uh written hed already
written book novel
already page proof said ive
got novel page proof
publisher going happy
change really need help
see truth well
figure deal uh
said heroin traveling
black hole get star
aa said thats rather dangerous
there singularity okay
there singularity
cant get get star
vega actually need
wormhole uh issue
wormhole implode collapse
quick nothing get
ill see figure
hold wormhole open
carl go going
like rent physicist right
like whatever need
getting car morning
ride uh uh former wife
daughter grad uation santa cruz
lind linda said ill drive
calculate okay drove
calculated fiddled around
became fairly obvious turn
somebody physicist
figure sooner thats
usual thing figure
go see people know
anyway figured
uh
like call
exotic matter repels
gravitationally put inside
throat wormhole hold
wormhole open like pushing
outward thats right basically repels
wall wormhole hold
open turn
enough exotic
matter hold wormhole open uh
deduced formula much
ba basically say
following uh move
wormhole let record show he
describe make wormhole
hold much ex got
matter sound like recipe
travel
wormhole close speed light
possibly
close speed
light
add energy density
way wormhole
stuff thats wormhole net
negative hold
wormhole open basically mean
youve got negative energy
positive enery
nothing known exotic matter oh yes
yeah oh
basement
mean oh
mean oh yes okay
exotic matter
would fulfill purpose
turn camera
government going
show
driveway okay go well learned
yakov barovich zovich
moscow zovic zovic one
inventers russian hydrogen bomb
okay learned
right okay really brilliant
learned
vacuum fluctuation
important
powerful manipulate
uh take box
remove everything
possibly removed box
youre left end tiny
fluctuation everything c
possibly could
box
electric field fluctuating
electric field fluctuating magnetic
field fluctuating proton
electron fluctuating ne ty grass
tyson creates form
pressure inside box well ne
there vanishing pressure
vanishing energy due
renormalization thats nast thats
nasty word physic
uh
uh well measure energy
whether produce gravity
uh although fluctuation
think
particle say particle light
flashing existence
randomly isnt
virtual particle people speak
virtual particle
okay weve spoken
show okay
green fact virtual
particle uh vacuum popping
existence popping
cant stop cant prevent
however take fluctuation
one region borrow put
another adjacent region little
put
electrically conducting sheet say
sheet superconducting metal
suppress
fluctuating electric field parallel
metal would create
infant current flowing metal
would would wipe
electric field parallel metal
uh element
kazmir effect yes thats casmir
effect yeah two
parallel plate evacuated
right there point
actually feel whole force
attracting force really
uh region uh
vacuum fluctuation suppressed
negative energy
energ negative energy sucking
together
work
youre holding plate uh
attract put energ
resist put put energy
go go together work
electric electromagnetic field
two plate casmer effect
uh exotic okay
basement youre
telling well dont
basement physicist let
say side remark h
learned lot vacuum
fluctuation ligo gravity
wave project get get
ill make remark
loo team perfected
technique called quantum precision
measurement based
manipulating vacuum
fluctuation uh order circumvent
uncertainty principle
business manipulating vacuum
fluctuation something
modern physic something
uh imagine ask
advanced
civilization manipulate vacuum
fluctuation adequately order make
enough exotic matter inside wormhole
hold wormhole open po
question physicist
colleague uh stimulated carl san
want wanting send heroin
black hole said use
wormhole got pulled open
physic colleague please help
carl figure advanced
civilization answer
still dont know uh 40 year later
still dont know right well
magic compared anyone
thought possible 50 thats right
year ago certainly dawn quantum
physic centennial
decade quantum discovery back
1920s well close friend
carl san ive developed close
friendship christopher nolan chris
different background
know lot science he
learned browsing web uh
uh know well enough ask
hard question thats like
uh asked first
answer
inspired ask question
sort translate give
colleague colleague
smarter uh role
pas interesting conduit
conduit interesting question
colleague work dude cant
leave well enough alone einstein say
maybe gravitational wave
emanating major gravitational
disturbance universe got
go find youre
first attempted right
university maryland
weber think think whats first
name joe weber course
cylinder remember
correctly uh trying
measure whether gravitational wave
washed could detect
distortion shape cylinder
think goal yeah well would
gravitational wave would drive
vibration cylinder end end
vibration okay uh
instrumented search uh change
amplitude phase vibration
cylinder cylinder finite
temperature always vibrating
little bit finite
temperature uh
instrumented uh whats called
electric transducer transducer
glued around uh middle
cylinder
squeezed would generate
electrical voltage could measure
theyre amazing thing p
electric transducer absolutely
amazing squeeze tiny tiny bit
get big voltage uhuh
mean joe weber tremendously creative
think working
university
marland 80 think
still working yeah thats
right began working uh
uh late 60 early 70 uh uh
announced seeing possible
evidence gravitation wave
lot skepticism time
remember let let im sorry started
working late 50 early 60
announced
69 uh seeing possible
evidence gravitational wave
number
physicist around world built
similar detector bottom line
end period shaking
others seeing grav
ation wave thats way
science work one person result
result somebody else
competitor somebody else us
different wall current somebody
another country need need
multiple verification
hand uh weber joe started field
triggered work theo
approach invented searching
gravitational wave dominant
approach uh 2000s
number research group
built similar detector improved
better better better uh
period time model
model model mean
enormous uh respect
sure decided
others uh decided look
differently ray weiss riner
weiss ray friend call mit
primary inventor
alternative technique
technique ultimately succeeded uh
invented wrote wrote
technical paper technique
identified noise kind noise
would deal
explained might deal
analysis
good detector could put
there recipe paper oh
gosh recipe go
forward wrote
1972 ry ry didnt publish
think figured dont
publish built one
seen gravitational way however
ray sent copy around
colleague uh put
quarterly report mit laboratory
worked
probably influential
nonpublished paper certainly
know physic mean
force triggered uh
huge effort actually succeeded
fortunate enough visit uh
cuz two lego experiment
one louisiana one
hanford washington
two cant one
result yeah youre looking
effect small
wouldnt believe unless see
two independent instrument go
youve got
pathway kilometer long 4 km 4
km long
evacuated send beam light
split sink beam laser
split go 90° angle
go end get
reflected back rejoin
want see wave line
line direction
identical go home theyre
slightly different one
leg experienced different
encounter fabric
spacetime continuum
thats thats know thats
actually want make
slightly different first
place mean send
send laser light
direction uh there beam splitter
light get split two go
two arm uh laser g go
like there beam splitter
light get split two one
arm direction arm
direction uh uh come
back recombines beam splitter
laser light coming
direction uh uh
recombines little bit light go
uh perpendicular direction
laser
output put
direction direction
signal length one
arm shortened length
arm length would
happen gravitational wave
washed arm thats right
get change much light
coming output right
youre trying find change
length difference remember
material press release
equivalent
to10th diameter proton
equivalent uh 10 million time
smaller atom 100 time
smaller proton 100th
diameter proton meanwhile
world vibrating everything
temperature cool much
want there still vibration
somebody walking
street remember campus
call campus thats
detect car road mile
away insulate thats
half science done experiment
get nobel prize
well thats thats thats
nobel prize given
yeah successful
isolated effect youre trying
measure way like describe
youre trying youre bouncing
light
mirror youre looking motion
mirror 10 million time
smaller atom
mirror
made uh well
mirror atom mirror
vibrating theyre
finite temperature amount
size
million time smaller uh atom
10 million time smaller uh
vibration atom undergoing
physic there
phenomenon trying measure
kind
buried need way get
seems like half
half effort brilliant
engineer youve brought
task accompl accomplish
good tool
idea got make damn
measurement obvious
need talented people assembled
absolutely
issue good team put
together uh learned ray
weisss idea saw knew
roughly strong strongest
gravitational wave knew already
uh would necessary
would collision two black
hole two black hol cant
summon real
thing universe might
produce right right cant
wish based knew
universe time
estimating wave strength
roughly correct level
would monitor
motion mirror
10 million time smaller atams
mirror thought
thats
crazy book
published
1973 went press ray
weiss wrote seminal paper
yet uh really studied paper fully
uh knew uh
crazy describes word
ray idea
say think there exercise
say show
promising mild gentle
textbook right get get
declare student student
challenge show well could
good idea
1973 fast forward half century
right 1850
flying good idea right
flying isnt good idea yeah
central issue
worked
decade shot success
1973 thought way
1975 turned around id long
conversation rey id long
conversation vladimir binsky
colleague
moscow done lot calculation
came conclusion
real shot
success put together superbly
strong team worked
decade need money
well supported think
national science foundation well yet
point nsf given rey
60000 get
started uh 6000 thats thats
much 1970s
national science foundation also
money air force office
scientific research im sure
much
vietnam era stopped
supporting science uh due something
called mansfield amendment american
politics thats nsf picked
gave 60000 drop
bucket compared needed
n st wasnt ready put big
money required member
team like appear front
congress defend thats thats
thats correct uh uh
much later issue getting
started get started
caltech different kind
institution ive ever
dealt caltech able say
propose colleague get
field uh uh build
experimental program parallel
ray weisss program mit co
chair division physic
mathematics astronomy caltech set
committee look committee
uh looked six month
detailed study came back
enthusiastic said let go ahead
caltech put private money 2
million private money get
started uh inflates 12
million today oh private money
nobody else putting anything
youre right thats different
cl different culture caltech
describ happened
brought ron dver scotland
start experimental effort nsf
nsf stood took notice
study came
conclusion
started funding u u ray weiss
became caltech mit collaboration
let fast forward
2016 uh make first
detection announc 16 announced
16 way would later learn
visited facility
louisiana already made
detection happy know
everyone completely zip mouthed
officially
huge like internet following
right people totally zip
mouthed swear didnt know
press release came yeah
sworn secret yes yes
confirmation first
detection came second facility
built hanford point
time delay gravitational
wave move speed light correct
earth finite size
worked yeah yeah
seven millisecond 7 second time
difference wave came
south entered earth
around tip antarctic
peninsula traveled
earth came earth
louisiana first washington
state second 7 millisecond later
wave
unaffected matter
earth couldnt
see difference earth
earth couldnt see
difference detector
detector hard
thing impress greatly
prediction made
albert einstein 1916 15
whatever albert einstein little
known fact mean physicist know
dont think public know einstein
laid equation
stimulated emission radiation
physical foundation laser
yeah thats wrote first
laser would take decade
actually built 1950s
im saying here einstein
predicting gravitational wave laying
foundation laser hundred
year later gravitational wave
found laser yes
crumb spilling plate einstein
kind
smart lo behold nobody surprised
nobel prize go project um
along ray weiss barry
barish uh share nobel prize
year oh 2017 yeah
apologized u didnt give u in6
uh didnt announce
uh past deadline well plus
delay anyway never
said obviously obvious
prize going obvious
yeah hey star talk fan dont know
know audio version
podcast actually post week
advance video version
get spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk cant
gent relativity einstein guy without
black hole
guy uh forgive asking
retell story youve probably told
thousand time there famous
bet made presal
physicist pral
hawking steph hawking uh way
university texas
presc think like
postto
starting thats old im
old guy im old guy youre youre
young kid im old man uh uh
made bet let see set
table black hole
agree exist ask
question something
outside black hole fall
happens information
contained object
gone forever okay uh
information theory whole
branch science shall call
science rising around
time
entropy um became buzzword among
many bet
ultimately
resolved bet stephen
hawking one side john presal
side whether
information get lost black
hole background
bad okay bad
uh fundamental law
quantum mechanic normally
formulated physicist widely agreed
quantum physic
fundamental uh quantum physic
underlies physic
successful theory ever put forth right
universe classical
physic
quantum fluctuation
probability arises quantum
physic approximation
ordinary everyday circumstance
many people caricature science
physic particular saying well
used think classical physic
discard
quantum physic thats true
quantum physic absorbed yeah well
relativity general relativity
absorbing newtonian gravity yeah
doesnt discarded bigger
understanding deeper understanding
okay want emphasize many
people get confused quantum
physic normally
formulated un almost universally
uh viewed
built right
beginning fact information
cannot
lost word information cannot
lost translation everyday
language something else
everyday language say uh
evolution everything universe
unitary buzzword
part normal lexicon
want say say
indicate there
extremely precise version
information lost
colloquial way saying okay okay
represent violation
fundamental tenet quantum theory
thats right stephen hawking back
visiting caltech way
weve interviewed star talk
iives check
19747
7475 spent year research
group caltech close
friend uh period
discovered something called
hawking radiation uh
slow evaporation black hole
emits radiation slowly
evaporates uh
uh began look much deeply
quantum theory black hole
came prediction
information really lost
black hole evaporate could form
black hole uh waited long
enough much longer age
universe normal black hole uh
black hole would evaporate
information went black
hole would gone black hole would
gone simply lost
information longer longer
complete violation
normal tenant quantum mechanic
yet claiming true
wrote paper
technical detail couldnt get
published
obvious wrong nobody
could see anything wrong
calculation fight
year get published
look p public paper see
submission date research
paper give yes give
submission date usually
revised date
published there revised date
there submission date
publication date something like
nearly year half later fought
whole year year
get thing published physicist
struggled ever
since uh uh u whose root
relativity tended believe hawking
u whose root grew
quantum mechanic instead
relativity first u
enamored relativity tended believe
hawk hawking made bet
presal whose root uh
quantum physic he
junior right young
whippersnapper coming
richard p fer professor profor
thetical physic calch im
richard p fan physic professor thecal
physic emeritus emeritus okay im young
whipper snapper oh man theyll take
job minute turned
chair
johan mean john brilliant he
hell lot smarter hell
lot smarter anyway made
bet
uh period hawking
starting visit caltech
ally 3 six week every year
yet wheelchair bound oh yeah hed
wheel wheelchair bound uh going
way back 1970 okay uh
1990 oh w much later okay made
bet around 1990 stage set okay
cage match set stephen
hawking titan field
subject
conclude yeah information
lost especially hawking radiation
evaporate black hole
everything gone there there
memory ccll
declaring information lost
root deep quantum
physic know never
shown wrong theyre
smarter know
lot quantum physic
well return let
explain
whole career ive
thought quantum gravity come
combining general relativity
quantum physic important
area physic also made
decision young
never work quantum gravity
field crowded many
smart people
pick im smart enough pick really
important problem solve uh
nobody else working
theyll theyll figure
later im right
problem important wont touch
problem problem wherever got
million people room
many smart many smart people
room anyway
agreed information lost
hawking conceited association
still hold
im still hold okay
led
concession understand correctly
stephen together st
working idea
information might uh
recovered
basically said
quantum physic form
black hole evaporates
there also tiny probability
black hole never formed
first place information sneak
root didnt
form first place
uh im sorry sound like
cop yeah well sound like
cop
clever keeping
physic work obvious
right conceivable
idea maybe ive misunderstood
got go back see ive said
even publicly thought
black black hole evaporates cuz
energy gravitational energy
vicinity black hole
spontaneously make pair particle
one particle escape one
fall black hole
keep going there black hole
left particle escape
inventory particle theyre
real particle dont recover
particle went first
place oh recover energy
dont inventory
particle dont get
particle necessarily okay
misunderstood ive wrong
think ive wrong thought get
particle particle come
blew mind uh dont think
certainly there proof
thats case well course
certainly proof case dont
dont dont think
case okay okay okay guy
lost
bat well okay hawking concedes
bat hawking concedes bat
stake loser
give winner encyclopedia filled
information
somehow escaped black hole
information penalty
gift thats right stephen
hawking conceded v big
international conference general
relativity gravitation dublin
ireland uh early 2000
gasp audience r
rumor going concede
big ceremony uh
played role ceremony
didnt concede uh uh
stephen gave presc big baseball
fan encyclopedia american baseball oh
kind encyclopedia okay well
idea thats thats clever
anyway less expensive yeah
didnt concede peculiar reason
uh alternative
formulation quant mechanic
uh information could lost due
fineman called sum history
formulation uh say dont
work quantum theory deep sort
way term quantum
technology needed ligo
thats separate story uh two
deepest physicist uh
uh working quantum theory
lifetime uh murray
galman jim hardle jim harle santa
barbara gmon calch moved
santa fe institute
retirement gilm man credited
proposing quark fundamental
article science thecal physic
young physicist ptech
galmon feineman
two colleague mine
enormously respect uh gman
hardle took
finemans path enderal
history approach quantum mechanic
developed form
could apply cosmology
universe uh
uh hard used study
quantum cosmology quantum mechanical
description birth
universe evolved
particular approach quantum mechanic
hardle took showed uh
approach deal perfectly well
information
loss uh deal
arises call closed
timel curve there certain
probability backward time travel
quantum quantum physic
fineman galman hardle
approach uh there certain
probability backward time travel
backward time travel uh
quantum level lose
information there elegant
mathematical uh formulation quant
physic weasly way well
thats thats standard
version quantum mechanic
version fan
hardland gman needed order
quantum mechanic entire
universe birth universe
getting issue
birth universe
quantum quantum gravity
rather enamored
approach although dont
look sideline admire
people smarter
courage work
crowded
field im impressed
uh fact within
formulation lose
information start
formulation one day marry
general relativity quantum physic
well
knocking door
knocking door
remind
professor thorn question
problem g relativity
melding together quantum physic
real holdup
well real holdup
logically incompatible
something give
thats qu general
relativity requires space
continuous continuum space
definite space
space
certain probability space warped
way another probability
warped way fact
probability yeah
classical probability quantum
quantum probability
smallest scale theyre
incompatible smallest scale theyre
incompatible place
gravity becomes extremely strong theyre
incompatible smallest scale
theyre incompatible uh even
room also theyre incompatible
theyre incompatible birth
universe gravity extremely
strong theyre incompatible cord
black hole gravity
extremely strong theyre incompatible uh
try make time machine hockey
independently student
identified process whereby
advanced civilization try make
time machine quite possibly
explode moment try turn
uh thats also controlled uh
law quantum gravity thats
havent seen time traveler
yet oh thats thats may
explain dead trying turn
machine thats right youre saying
einstein put forth general
theory relativity
successful many realm
picked newtonian gravity
failed yet must confess concede
there limit far general
relativity go although weve yet
find limit quantum physic
betting betting pool say
general relativity going succumb
quantum physic way yeah
thats one way say certainly
incompatibility
two strength theorist trying
theyre like performing
shotgun wedding two branch
physic somehow yeah think
looking outside since
ive chosen work field
string theory uh likely
successful route correct loss
theyve add 50 years0 40
year long come im 84 year
old come thats thats thats
drop bucket come wait
einstein went special relativity
general relativity 10 year kepler
went weird nested solid
kepler three law motion 10
year thats lone scientist weve
working try controlled
fusion
longer 50 year ligo
took 50 year time first
started working gravitational wave
succeeded 50 year
thing take long time yeah ligo
machine merging quantum
physic general relativity idea
could ive said
dont want say
youre youre kip thorn ive
said brian green okay
brian green like generation said
brian green said brian youve
working strength theory decade
uh maybe stupid
figure waiting
someone else born field
solve way none
rest none saying
im stupid figure let
choose another profession theyre
saying problem hard
go 40 year really smart people
figuring something tell
either theyre barking wrong tree
none smart
enough overreacting
think remember
build none
smart enough okay
community like
nobel prize really belongs thousand
people doesnt belong uh
genesis joe weber genesis
joe weber build ne newton spoke
standing shoulder giant
really true
see farther others
ive stood shoulder
giant come
thats nature science uh
struggle colleague
string theory theory
quantum
gravity learned enormous amount
uh show promising uh
going continue next
generation ultimate success
probably like final word
right
k ive heard
rumor whichever faculty caltech
get nobel prize get parking
spot name true
went calch nobel prize
get parking spot
name pay
parking spot much
without nobel prize okay
fun rumor though heard
thats true usc
true caltech okay there
many running around
nobel prize parking spot
valuable chew usc okay chew
usc right youre 84
84 year
wisdom hsing vein artery
project youre working
next several year made
gradual transition conscious uh away
science away scientific
research uh beginning uh around 15 year
ago
oh know would like like
believe live 110 thats uh
intended goal uh uh next
uh uh remaining decade wanted
thing really enjoyed
enjoyed science ive conventional
caltech professor half century uh
enormously enjoyed enormously enjoyed
working student trained
50 phd student far
important research uh uh
done uh
worked area science
ive enormous fun ive turned
younger generation
uh theyre smarter okay
surfing
skydiving okay taking
decided would like
spend decade uh creative
work interface science
art oh interstellar
example going released
september delayed
holiday season december
rerelease rerelease december
2024 thats right thats right
enormously enjoyable
learned great
collaborate somebody brilliant
completely different
christopher
nolan recent collaboration
book poetry painting
leah howerin
uh uh warped side
universe uh poetry attempt
poetry painting trying
see whether possible tightly
integrating painting verse
convey essence issue science
spirit ent essential feature
without conveying precise
detail thats right genre
precise detail
anyway ive enjoying
way ive always felt way
bangos starry night yes look
painting say clearly
saw definitely
felt yes yes get
experience universe
lens yes ive always appreciated
art play role yeah
second movie thats work
decade tell
well something
started stepen hawk linda opst
partner uh starting
interstellar uh wonderful work
uh movie might might never
get made im going tell
aside fact
scifi solid scifi high
buil outset
work end uh
may turn try turning
novel ive never tried write novel
whether would fun
try actually thing
put almost large fraction effort
lion share effort since
beginning pandemic
history ligo project ligo
gravitational wave project
think pretty clearly
technically difficult uh thing
thats ever done physicist
anybody uh anybody yeah probably
anybody 11 100th diameter
proton thats anybody uh
success required uh amazing
developing amazing technology new
technology
required
developing uh computer simulation
colliding black hole required
developing quantum precision measurement
technology ligo
playing major role
circumvent whats called
heisenberg uncertainty principle mind
still partly blown
said youre bypassing
heisenberg uncertainty princi thats
right manipulating vacuum
fluctuation like advanced
civilization might routine
thing yeah developed
new area technology lio uh
also political
thing get billion dollar
taxpayer money uh field
doesnt didnt exist began
bet someone
else right plus think even
naysayer remember correctly
colleague would say
pipe political battle
washington yeah tell nay
saers got people take care
leading
astronomer got people take
want people
theyve come around think
okay theyve come around
exciting lego
succeeded sociology
transition small science big
science rocky process
thats right word sociology
thats dont like working
big pro big science project
like working
crowded field
tr make
wouldnt happened transation
wouldnt happened otherwise
genius barry beish making
happen genius robie voked
getting u partway
beginning initial director
one sold congress
uh really got u going
complicated story
set five collaborator ive
working history
finished draft six sent
liu colleague comment
getting back huge number
comment itll take two
year think anyway
history nature
project interesting
complex history quite important
f history science esp
consider people knew
nothing lio see
headline discovered
gravitational
would thought
challenge preceded know
read result oh scientist
discover well
like said politics sociology
genesis who standing
whose shoulder naysayer
overcome
international collaboration key input
soviet union depth
cold
war
fascinating story
enormous
fun know arthur c clark said said
um space air flag
wave maybe universe
place waving
flag collaboration get
like kip
delight thanks making time lot
fun first star talk
look forward uh release
rerelease interstellar uh
recording come
uh already know let
reaffirm film took people
ride uh far beyond anything
imagined kind impact
people way 2001 space odyssey
mysterious
modern future still
relevant left
question ask question answered
want think yeah
really genius
christopher
nolan uh taking science
put together together
combining human story
powerful uh uh marquee
director marquee actor made
sure would get noticed music yes uh
went concert hun zimmer
think night last
uh let loose didnt know
basically said
mu certain piece music
interstellar close perfection
achieved wow im going give
another listen
2001 without musical track
strauss wale
different
zimmer original music
remarkable score uh amazing look
forward next 25 year
live
to0 uh maybe reprise
conversation well check see
youve coming along dude okay
thanks lot thanks great see
thanks special
conversation exclusive oneon one
star talk hip thorn nobel
laurate even let touch
metal first time ive ever touched
nobel prize well medal really
belongs thousand medal earned
huge team uh humbly declares
enter new era science
collaboration really
work especially
international collaboration
scientist getting along even time
leader country
conflict thats messed thats
thats messed im neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist star
talk always bid keep looking
music
