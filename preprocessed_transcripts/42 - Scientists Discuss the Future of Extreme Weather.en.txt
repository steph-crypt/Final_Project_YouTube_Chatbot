care weather nobody
want weather get
best one devastating
aspect hurricane storm surge
look hurricane helen
week ago massive hurricane
500 mil across give
best forecast world give
plenty lead time
decision evacuate cant
control need category
six category five keep
getting bigger bigger
storm weve never seen
getting category
music
six star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist got
chuck nice chucky baby hey
neil chuck today topic
weather ah excellent yes thats supposed
safest thing talk
anyone right longer oh
guess good point longer
good point well know
extreme comb earth find
who top weather person thats
gonna sam champion wabc news he
amazing gonna yeah every every
local news person
certain like best weather
forecaster go
mall star
access brought
chief chief head honcho noah
national oceanic atmospheric
administration dr richard spinrad oh
gosh rick man hey im
great neil chuck delighted
thanks let get full title
straight secretary
commerce ocean atmosphere
thats different title noah
administrator right yeah
actually full title probably
take full duration show
secretary commerce
roan atmosphere
administrator noah national
oceanic atmospheric administration
really two hat job
reminded commerce
huge branch u government care
climate weather
good service delivered
air water land
relationship climate deeply
impacted yeah like commerce um
melting uh ice causing passage
uh near alaska
there contested water
russia want
water uh course china
ice nobody
looking point
ice ice open water
water right yeah yeah thats
tell couple thing uh
relationship navy
obviously care ocean
well yeah thats great question
actually worked navy
first part professional
career part
government dont work
yeah congress worked
congress yet probably wont
happen either uh navy mean
obviously navy care uh ocean
climate atmosph uh
operate ship
theyre going concerned
impact climate going
base know think
norfol weve got
atlantic fleet sea level rise
impacting operation uh base
important element naval
operation north virginia yeah north
virginia yeah could say
thing
anywhere navy operates care
shor side facility uh
also care ability fly
uh carry mission
obviously mean one strongest
component navy understanding
ocean uh change
dynamic ocean
affect ship submarine right
also uh last checked there several
whole country south
pacific average sea level
foot aage elevation
land foot sea
level start melting
glacier well lose entire country
creating call climate
refugee exactly exactly
sort theoretical
thing thatll happen thousand year
sea level rise uh rate
youre alluding increased
dramatically grad
student know decade back
would talk sea level rise
say 1 three millimeter per year
place doubled tripled
consequently nation
actually going eliminated
end century theyll
actually underwater right yeah whole
island whole island nation
disappear whole island nation
tell course everyone care
weather although climate change
politicized know recently
id like remind people noah
founded year uh
1970 signed law
republican president
politicization
climate um feel like
recent phenomenon clearly
care weather nobody want
weather get best
part life
job yeah think lot uh
making political issue come
trying figure who whose fault
know get blame
thing noah
mission much looking
future prediction
projection u less
hey caused problem
well predict
change going future
talk thats people hold
theyre trying make
decision based prediction
however moving goalpost
time rick quite frankly
happens um projection
modled okay
variable um increase
amount fossil fuel burning
mean thats really issue
fossil fuel burning
coming online change everything
guy said going happen
instance um prediction
made previous um basically
everybodys like oh yeah well theyre
wrong first saying
theyre going wrong
going happen theyre saying
wrong happening much
quicker yeah model would normally
future expectation rate co2
increase rate anything isnt
right uh rick yeah thats right
climate scientist
would call assumption
stationarity say thing
theyre going
future thats whole
point take model
talking neil uh
initialize put data front
start model assumption
make condition
going change year 10 year
20 year thats challenge
front u getting really
good improving skill
model rick scope
uh im wondering
think noah founded
way deep dive
hardly anyone certainly even
geologist biologist ever
combined ocean air sort
conversation atmospheric
scientist oceanic scientist
full system full full um
organic system interplaying
part seemed came age
little later uh computer model
started something say
po
whats noah purview also
space weather like sun
look like land grab
spacecraft started
ocean want like
solar system universe going
universe going yeah neil
youre exactly right earth
system best place see
hurricane form grow move
cant predict without good
understanding ocean
atmosphere know best example
one uh hurricane katrina
may remember intensified
really quickly made landfall
around new orleans looking
back could predicted
better wed better data
ocean gulf mexico
happen today would predicted
better able back
2005 yeah certainly call
rapid intensification hurricane
made landfall thats
would look whole ocean
surface ocean put
data yeah guy guy mean
youre youre humble
youre tooting horn
last uh huge storm
experienced um rapid int
ification predicted happen
indeed um uh due primarily amount
moisture held
land mass uh storm uh
going traverse know
say yeah didnt back
2005 take
im sorry dont think dont
think speaks way
chu love way said though
chuck right rick
catch u thing land
water neutral
forcing forcing factor
hurricane make landfall
understood recent hurricane
saturated landscape
land hurricane make
landfall sort latent heat
available water
saturated ground
normally hurricane would would weaken
go land right yeah
temperature right
know temperature ocean
case gulf mexico going
know temperature
atmosphere going mean
storm hold water
think hurricane harvey
hit houston dropped five
foot five foot rain kid
didnt talk foot rain
look hurricane
helen week ago
especially western north carolina
damage water youre absolutely
right people think hurricane
wind wind case
water term forcing
function hurricane
water thats sort still
rendered land mass uh soaked
saying continue
play water got
nowhere else go guess get
yeah well thats basically
think combination youve got
youve got soaked uh uh terrain
previous precipitation prior
hurricane coming hurricane
got moisture would
helen also huge
massive hurricane 500 mile
across uh thats thats
significantly larger
hurricane large hurricane warm
water moisture available
ground already pretty wet
youre dumping bucket onto wet
sponge going cause lot
flooding note
also care bottom
ocean like
well there hole
bottom
ocean there plug oh thats right
yeah yeah bottom ocean
important without bottom
ocean wouldnt ocean
guess okay important mean
topography ocean going
drive help drive uh current uh
especially coastal environment
water go flow uh
going impact thing like uh
accentuated tide area youve
got extreme change topography
important especially
context hurricane probably one
biggest problem one
devastating aspect hurricane
storm surge happens water
ocean water get close
shore topography
right actually funnel storm
surge end 12 15
foot thats got tampa bay
uh hurricane milton hit yeah
hurricane sandy hit new york mean
think tropical storm sandy
point hit new york storm
surge took u actually
call superstorm sandy
tropical cyclone
easter component
well kind like worst
factor combined yeah youre
right storm surge yeah know grew
new york mom living
apartment got flooded result
superstorm sanding uh
thats interesting 12
year ago didnt forecast
pat

let get back show
start reaching caring
sun
um well weve always
part mission think fair
say mean obviously sun
luminosity energy
next level sun cycle
solar storm
there star delivering
energy model
fluctuation energy model
guy seem car yeah
sun pretty dynamic
uh object uh go
cycle right actually
middle one 11year cycle
started last year one really
interesting aspect
sun occasionally actually send
huge huge coronal mass injection
charged gas plasma
get ejected surface
sun speed 1 2 million
mile hour uh sort
positive side factor
create beautiful northern light
aurora borealis little bit
insidiously also interact
navigation system interact
electrical grid uh affect uh
power grid uh affect uh
communication system fact
storm uh erupted last may may
2024 solar storm solar storm solar
storm category call g5
geomagnetic storm 5 highest uh rank
storm one severe weve
seen decade didnt hear
much well know neil
lot hear thats
knew coming
year past might known
coming could make change
kind change airplane could
change root order
avoid impact solar storm
gps system see actual
discharge make way
cool yes fact
launched uh june 2024
launched new satellite weather
satellite one would
use turn tv show
full disc weather
pattern east coast west
coast one compact
coronagraph oh tool im
sorry guy lost neil said oh
nice said said compact
coronograph like uh know like say
uh glass case like
glass case im like okay
compact coronagraph got one
great invention recent
century ability create
image sun telescope
though set optic though
sun eclipsed
moon oh sun get eclipsed
moon bright stuff
blotted see edge see
explosion edge right
remember saw eclipse
recent eclipse stationed
vermont uh saw along
edge little sort
prominence sticking imagine
able right
rather waiting around
eclipse rick say put
one orbit thats cool yeah
actually one orbit
another sensor discover
satellite l1 lrange
one point um earth sun lrange yes
exactly okay chuck dont
lrange explainer
want uh really go deep dive
lrange point uh go
l12 34 uh really incredible
um m5 cant leave m5 uh
um clearly pay attention
four five important
really
good year gr point made
equal right want see
find perfect equilibrium
solar system uh thats lrange
point represents love exactly exactly
depends two body around
youre describing lrange
point rick earth sun
lrange point correct yeah
well describe
multiple view sun different
angle say earth orbit
l1 l5 look
basically whole threedimensional
character sun
coronal mass ejection
necessarily aimed u need
care noah care
mostly one going
aimed u math
thing travel 1 two
million mile per hour sun 93 million
mile away know three
four day transit give people
enough lead time make preparation
major geomagnetic storm
imagine future colony
moon mar uh
neither object shielding
kind radiation way
pretty much earth
atmosphere ozone dont
presumably would deeply
connected capacity
predict everyone would know
run underground run behind
shelter sort thing
ask okay might silly question
im asking um
equipment noah really space
organization mean youre looking back
earth stuff
space got buoy stuff
thats true thats true take back
take back okay youre absolutely
right um talk
ejection move
stuff stuff hardened
mean radiation
got like damaging
thing equipment right yeah youre
going able move mean
immense amount energy
actually
really similar discussion
hurricane going able
move hurricane spite
people may think make
prediction work tell people
one bearing tampa
plus minus 20 mile got two
day evacuate thing space
weather get picture especially
youve got multiple view say
going hit pretty hard
northern part quebec asia
therefore folk make adjustment
three day power
grid theyre electrical grid
revor aircraft theyre
going affected navigation
purpose chuck asked
satellite already orbit
certainly susceptibility
cant say hey bank
left hover africa
clear asia right cant
cant uh shield
certain extent
know coming
make accommodation regard power
use another satellite uh cover
one mo might
vulnerable sacrifice
satellite yeah dont
dont put
there something called
unexpected event foresee day
event unexpected
one taken surprise
regard noah modeling
agency modeling thing
happening taking everyone surprise
there really interesting aspect
question neil um
there there famous story
meteorology called isaac storm
fact eric larson wrote great book
isaac storm hurricane
hit galvaston year 1900
folk galvaston 1900 storm
unexpected storm didnt
expect hit obviously there
never going another isaac storm
weve improved thing
though happen uh much shorter
time scale would say
may unexpected like
tornado u time able
give people react
shorter right tornado
looking average lead time
tornado 12 minute whoa
50 year ago lead time tornado
minus five
minute okay doesnt even make
sense im saying tornado
already know tornado
thats right thats right yeah
something wrong picture um
wait clarify youre
talking prediction
existence tornado youre talking
path tornado take
form yeah yeah path going
take intense going
gotcha yeah like
like hurricane tornado
classification intensity
extended fueta scale tornado one
five uh kind
thing right say
think tornado uh
aggregation tornado going
take path probably going
ef2 probably going
hit 15 minute way
12 minute 15 minute enough time
get way tornado
go underground yeah underground yeah
thats thats incredible
feel mean deep resonant
emotion uh example go
see movie know stormchasers
movie know yeah twister twister
let commiserate
together uh feel
see film much
effort call say help u
get right make stuff
true
tornado actually call cow
come go
disappears course chuck thats
stupid question everybody know
uh using bow vine
sensor tornado uh
forecast system yet
cow could totally hook
mind ask
noah annual budget uh
billion would say
noah effort save people life
level far beyond value
budget well mean talk
answer yes rick youre head
organization christ sake man ne
answer yes right thank
rick uh talk life
livelihood lifestyle
property life um certainly
life reason hed
give best forecast
world give plenty
lead time
decision evacuate
decision take action
cant control like think
two thing one quality
forecast getting better
second trust public
forecast uh onscreen
meteorologist emergency manager
high enough say
better evacuate storm coming
way people actually take action
there question mean talked
storm galston
year um 1900 think number
something like 10000 life
lost storm wow thats
ever going happen
country ever thats
quality forecast ability
trusted people make
decision yeah absolutely
saving also affect uh forecast
fishery right sort
coastal management marine food
marine forecast part
weather service
also responsibility managing
marine fishery uh mean
one stock assessment
many fish healthy
fish healthy
population establish regulation
sustainably fish uh
uh fish maintain strong
seafood economy part
department commerce
important economic consideration
respect said uh whats
relationship country
know national organization
international affiliation
like typhoon thats raging
taiwan right come
sustain sustainability food supply
like working china doesnt
give damn
whats role
care coastline
uh oceanic uh prop oceanic
property line youre
studying entire earth regard
climate share data
country responsive
whats relationship yeah yeah
absolutely cant job without
strong international collaboration
take couple different form
worldwide organization
world meteorological organization
member fact
head national weather service
u representative wo uh
organization
establish uh policy regard
data yeah noah data
publicly available uh use
lever say
nation hey giving
dont give u well
there lot collaboration data
recognize need data
improve forecast need
data improve forecast
start talking fishery
yeah there lot international
agreement lot fish
open ocean water
agreement agreement
hey much fish
take sustainably say allow
population fish stay stay
uh uh healthy also try um
protector uh fishery
um enforcing law illegal
unreported unregulated fishery
call iuu fishing uh rees
lot international cooperation
know big big
ocean know thing
similar way
artemis accord recently
signed upwards 30 country
new agreement conduct
space space exploration signed
space fairing nation active
accord thats going right
example send rover
moon mar learn something
would share
country send rover
dont make mistake
collaborate uh
interesting
internationality uh
certainly uh would would contain tap
rot thing cooperatively
space there yeah think
there lot commonality
thought going
mind mind talking
emis accord neil
similar kind agreement
making observation ocean there
one nation cover
ocean uh major
program called argo
basically uh robot go
throughout ocean go
drift around
international agreement
said let agree
robot float look like
let build spec
let put thing
there four 5 thousand
theyve
floating around decade let
share data common data
repository buoy
thinking right
actually dive dont spend
lot time surface
float around ascend
1000 2000 meter depth
collect temperature solinity kind
variable measured theyll drift
10 day day 2000
meter come back surface
transmit data satellite
communication central repository
dive back start
know rinse repeat basically
know thats badass say
yeah know nation
though probably got back door
like find oil dont tell anybody
else hey star talk fan dont know
know audio version
podcast actually post week
advance video version
get spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk let take
subject climate change
moment know
fraction third every x amount
co2 go atmosphere
ocean uptake third
fraction yeah yeah
there variety estimate
thats thats pretty close maybe even
closer half definitely large
percentage okay mean
dissolved co2 ocean
form partial pressure
equilibrium co2 air
stop co2 production
even introduce co2 scrubber
atmosphere
there less co2 pressing
ocean ocean say make
make equilibrium
itll start releasing give
atmosphere give
atmosphere true would
see immediate effect quite
time perhaps decade even
stopped fossil fuel burning today
short answer question neil
yes people talk flywheel
carbon cycle uh could stop
introduction uh interesting raised
question actually actively
removing carbon dioxide
atmosphere would accelerate
diminishment excess carbon
dioxide atmosphere would
still yeah youre right decade
would see ocean responding
kind part uh problem uh
dynamic described
increased carbon dioxide dissolution
ocean manifest ocean
acidification
right ph thing going okay course
yeah case simply
matter like opening
bottle cocacola
co2 uh go back liquid
atmosphere lot co2
become part carbon cycle
within atmosphere including
decrease ph increased
acidification thats see
uh complete bleaching coral reef
death coral reef
way entire
ecosystem yeah yeah
thats part uh fact
major contribution coral bleaching
actually temperature temperature
warming water
chemical makeup coral
increased acidification uh
erosive gross vent corls
people talk terraforming mar
moving
im sorry excellent
segue earth uh rebuttal
rebuttal comment
power geoengineering
turn mar earth
power geoengineering turn earth
back earth wouldnt need mar
right yeah thats kind
view rick
past hurricane season
imagination
category life kicking
usual new
normal new
normal right today recording
october like 75 degree
outside uh say unseasonably
warm temperature today soon
become seasonably
warm thats unseasonable becomes
seasonable thats new normal
need category six
category five keep getting bigger
bigger keep saying category
five storm weve never seen
getting category
six chuck stop poking bear
youre love question chuck
get minute
want say um yeah
keep thinking uh new york
time colonist tom freedman said
global warming global
weirding weirding know
think neil dont talk global
warming anymore talk climate change
thats manifest
many many different way
fundamentally fundamentally
putting energy
system greenhouse
effect there energy coming
system question uh
whats going seasonable
seasonable storm look like
thing going different uh
year example predicted
normal uh hurricane season
turning normal
certain measure going become
new normal well think logic
suggests probably see lot
hurricane activity future
term intensity storm
much water sort
thing get chuck comment
know take
need another category
category six saffer simpson scale
want name chuck
hurricane category six hurricane
well there something wrong
calling something nice hurricane
thats well call
nice nice leave
last name called chuck
hurricane chuck
hurricane really need
regard uh expand focus
know saffer simpson scale
really measure wind right uh
strong wind see
every time hey wind
gotten 130 mile hour
cat war kind thing
look hurricane
looking impact
storm surge talked volume
water hurricane like like
harvey year ago need people
understand looking
peak wind
could cat five
really strong 170 hour wind
may impact cat 3
large volume water like
hurricane h
find way people full
hurricane look
imp going let
toot horn moment
1989 sequel back future titled
back future part two uh went
future year
2015 watching movie
1989 theyre imagining
year 2015 there point
marty
doc get car doc put
umbrella marty say
say oh future
weather forecasting know
exact minute going start rain
right instant start
rain stop ready stop
stop put umbrella away
exactly course
smartphones itll show
rain going begin
end thats im saying
thats true never even thought
give time day
like 3 pm start yeah spot
tell much
intense chuck growing
like really want
know might rain tomorrow
give
50 chance mean know
absolutely nothing right
grandmother knew badis acting
shoulder tell baby
going rain tomor shoulder
know noah got grandma
back
room yeah
right e hows knee tell
tell going rain eel
predicts hurricane
exactly well know interesting
gonna say neil yeah
couple apps phone
fact use okay
know picnic
wait hour kind
thing thats less
prediction
observation radar
weve got satellite got
much resolution right
start right within
hour two say hey storm
mean use time im
im walking dog im saying right
wait
hour youre say youre saying thats
realtime observation
whats exactly exactly yeah yeah
uh tornado really good
example know weve gotten really
good observing tornado using
new sophisticated application
use something called dual polarization
weather radar
old radar basically send
signal see come back
start manipulating signal
looking polarization
signal determine uh rain
sleet snow get good
resolution say yeah
sleet know temperature two
mile away warmer see
fast coming hour
going rain
okay cool man actually fly
hurricane weve
quite uh
two actually
least three airplane use fly
hurricane thats
right stuff right want talk
right stuff man ive done
team got
piss get
job fair rick
math youre standing
stationary earth 170 mph
wind coming thats going
tumble bus truck cow
course fly however um
airplane open air fly 500 600 mile
hour way faster air
hurricane dangerous
airplane might otherwise think
yeah im going first tell
dangerous thing
crew real ace amazing
professional equipment
fly actually fly 50yearold
airplane scheduled buy
brand new one soon fly
uh navy p3s airplane
navy used use find submarine
here kicker fly high
enough hurricane yeah
go eyewall
hurricane there extraordinary
vertical uh wind current youre going
go several thousand foot
uh uh elevation change
commercial flight cleveland uh
youd real problem youd
sending complaint airline g
lot uh voucher giving
end flight
repeatedly well fly well like
figure four pattern
hurricane two three time
really cool thing though
dont fly aircraft
hurricane say 8 10000 ft
also drop drone airplane
drone fly
lower altitude get data
need know talked
jo writing youre getting
data every turn oh getting data
wu real time going back
national hurricane center
assimilating data
predictive model
flight track intensity
forecast improved 10 15 20
realtime message guy
beach say dont know
evacuate uh gotten much
better look look track
hurricane milton saw two
three day saying gonna
hit tampa st pete spot
totally tight rick
weather phenomenon around world even
simply higher temperature
ever uh whatever
phenomenon thats stretching limit
might model
comfortably contained within certain
parameter every time there
unprecedented
event uh didnt predict
model
whats whats next step
yeah thats great question
especially kind extend
say something like ai
machine learning artificial intelligence
machine learning fit um
uh extraordinary event
think heat wave weve seen
drought weve seen
example uh end providing
incredible volume new data
artificial intelligence application
depend critically call
training data data
happened past used
training model future
would argue dont fully
characterize particular event
forecast
able collect data
event definition
improving ability use ai
technique machine learning technique
except definition ai thats
mining data data
never seen yet see
argument making sure
fully measure characterize
extreme event lot
investment noah building
system provide uh much
intense higher temporal resolution
data thing like extreme
precipitation one main thing
trying right
clarify temporal resolution
think spatial resolution know
much detail b
see location temporal resolution
would whats happening hour
minute second
resolution time case people
wondering everybody want know whats
happening neighborhood right
lot
exactly um right tell
well weve got data york
county last uh month thats
good enough trying
really increase ability
collect data mean
volunteer observation program mean
using sophisticated new technology
talked radar radar
122 radar around country uh
radar many decade old
there new technology
thing like phased array radar
might able use get
sort higher resolution observation
sound like
noa might need bigger
budget im saying flying
around 50 year old prop plane okay
got sensor old 20 year
old 20 year old like need like come
congress let make rain noah
20 year ago smartphones
youtube didnt exist term
mean look
full mission really pretty
incredible weve talking mostly
weather space weather
atmospheric weather also make
nautical chart know
youre boater want chart
want know deep water
shallow area
manage marine protected area
havent even talked fishery
management know cost
every american service
cost six cent per day here
need need sarah mlin sing
song sing song could
tell people six cent
day support noah way
right need sarah mclin worthy
song yes
exactly right let let flow
nautical chart
aurora
boreales noah life
eight cent day two
penny youre paying
well rick thanks making time
u thank uh know last cross
path back trying figure
see last eclipse uh
lot lot folk saw
clouded eclipse happen
thing called
airplane could take
next eclipse youll wait
come farm
want say uh delight
uh
think would uh likely
replaced mean political
appointee political appointee
serve pleasure
president mean think youre
right guy se several people
several nasa
administrator went
multiple president multiple party
yeah reminder
u certain activity
nation um transcend politics
transcend political leadership
theyre theyre surfing
science underpinning
know science
scientist right gotta go
give regard whole agency
blast chuck
pleasure thank much rick
thanks star talk love
everything told u give u
great hope future indeed chuck
always good man always
pleasure right neil degrass tyson
youre personal astrophysicist
always bid keep looking
