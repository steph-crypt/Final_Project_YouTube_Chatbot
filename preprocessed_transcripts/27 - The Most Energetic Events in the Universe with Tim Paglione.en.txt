gamma ray cosmic ray shock
wave whats best way create
high energy phenomenon
large hydrant collider going
rate bajillions collision
theyre able
figure basically interaction
rate proton high energy
muon exotic place
universe mhm hear
also detect muon earth
earth atmosphere bright bright
gamma ray background particle
shower extensive air shower
theyll come flying muon
stream surface
thousand went body
gotta love science people
got love
music
star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist got
cosmic query lined
mean got chuck nice house
thats right whats neil right
good feeling good good know
mining colleague sound
illegal tim pagone tim man
right welcome star talk
first time thanks yeah known
long probably like 20
year man welcome show youre
fellow astrophysicist youre professor
city university new york nice
graduate uh college excellent
york college one campus
cuny system astrom
astrom short uh
full name astrom nyc astro
comm astrom community
building community okay youd
mentor student within community
yep 74 74 student yeah weve
going dozen year yeah cu
good enough scientist
know live island
right got pas torch
point let go share torch yeah thats
good
yes scientist actually
bringing scientist right
dont vote dont vote
island bring
island yeah unless say
believe astrology theyre like
got get good educator
show thats error
let honest let honest
vote
one reason
youve done lot thinking
lot observing lot
publishing extreme object
universe people love
extreme thing everybody love extreme
love go bigger go home
yes yeah super fun thats stuff yeah
ascend
electromagnetic spectrum energy
go red orange yellow green blue
violet left skipped
skipped indigo cuz indigo doesnt belong
thats isaac newton
mystically fascinated broke b
biv devau
dont
think
roy g b right violet
ultraviolet mhm give skin
cancer mh xrays
give bone cancer
bone gamma ray turn
hulk go right
tell make gamma
ray universe know
star make regular light also
know black hole vicinity
heat gas theyll
radiate ultraviolet xrays gamma
ray seem come
place yeah energetic
light need really
super energetic process
blow stump huge shock
run area accelerate
particle nearly speed light
shock mean something specific
astrophysics tell u cu
otherwise shock mean anywhere oh
dear thats mean see
black hole
shocked shock yes
mean simply put certain
area there there speed sound
go beyond thats shock
make shock make shock right
yeah right go beyond like
need process overtake
something fast speed sound
medium thats right like
explosion star explodes
supernova itll send shock wave
interstellar medium
thatll bunch gas high
density itll bunch magnetic
field let ask yeah
look wasnt middle
explaining something co
okay medium
right air medium
shock wave sound travel
right sound sound
right earth
earth space
vacuum exactly shock
traveling good question yeah there
always little bit something going
oh yeah anytime
there kind
discontinuity would also
describe shock thing
im interested thatll create gamma
ray high energy high energy
particle called cosmic ray theyre
accelerated bunched shocked
magnetic field okay go
shocked thats thats st thats
madeup phrase shocked
like jacked im shocked im shocked
baby exactly tell right
right one sentence
mentioned gamma ray cosmic ray
shock wave yeah right
high energy phenomenon
youre coming whats
best way create high energy
phenomenon know
laborat accelerator right yeah
understanding acceler
accelerator help u
job actually really
large hydron collider going
mh switzerland cern cern yeah mhm
rate know
bajillions collision theyre
uh able figure
basically interaction
rate proton high
energy made actually
model proton proton collision
interstellar medium little
accurate uh kind nice
work way higher energy
mean universe universe
yeahs taking credit universe
super mega royal people
star yeah royal wii
ever one exactly
accelerating proton much higher
energy even powerful
accelerator earth yeah thats right
okay theyre fast moving
single proton make shock wave right
go need wave
mean bunch yeah yeah
need bunch long
find another proton
like ambient proton
hydrogen atom ambient ambient proton
right yeah sleepy
one one looking ambient ambient
okay there interstellar
cloud hydrogen
mining business hanging
get whacked one high energy
proton thatll create bunch
particle nuclear reaction
like get particle
accelerator thing come
pons come
positively charged negative
call daughter product
sure never sun product
wondering daughter rarely
disappoint son often wonder
marie curri oh
make sense good one interesting cool
would yeah
datable point time right oh
sure cuz thats see
see x alpha beta
gamma ray first named
didnt know thats
first three letter greek
alphabet make sense yeah
source energy moving
experiment somewhere else
alpha ray became
discover helium
nucleus yeah thats kind weird
right nucleus helium alpha
ray okay call ray
didnt know cant
couldnt distinguish energy
wave energy particle wow
idiot
okay alpha beta turned
electron electron electron
go helium nucleus right
electron see aint right thats
wild wild really interesting
result though
whole bunch different energy
electron beta ray would come
led enrio fery say
must something else carrying
extra energy turned
little tiny massless particle
charge nutr nutrino
little
little one yeah eno eno
make make little neutra
neutral yeah right
energy budget resolved thats
right thats always
leftover yeah okay
residual nutrino yeah
yeah thats thats thats gangster
prediction bad right say
missing energy therefore there
particle charge carried
away didnt detect thats thats
like making totally fill
blank yeah turned
ex case wild thats
cool man right tell
proton hit make
shower particle another proton
another proton yeah okay
busted open proton
classical knowledge nuclear physic
end quark inside
yeah uh guess pair
quark make particle
proton lighter proton
yeah yeah well pair yes
guess dont know yeah mean
reaction proton proton
interaction end primarily get
muon oh youll get pons primarily
pons one interest
there there positive one
negative one neutral one
neutral one charge
immediately decay two gamma ray
usually see there
whole chart whats going
need fluent otherwise
dont know hell going
yeah kind
okay uh remind u muon
im fascinated exist
yeah theyre theyre
shortlived thiss one
interesting quantify
shortlived quantify mean
shortlived second micros
second way smaller way way faster even
shorter okay fact time
take muon reach surface
earth space
atmosphere theyre created
cosmic ray hit atmosphere
shouldnt live get
surface traveling almost speed
light shouldnt make yet
h one
decayed say theyre yeah
okay trick theyre
traveling fast clock
different speed oh thats
amazing stuff muon
exotic place universe
hear also detect muans
earth oh yeah whats going
youll get one energetic
cosmic ray come hit
something atmosphere
phenomenon exactly right happening
u earth atmosphere bright
bright gamay background fact um
particle shower extensive air
shower cuz busted open proton
okay theyll theyll come flying
muon stream
surface thousand went
body wow another another thousand
oh oh another
thousand interesting thing
lifetime short
shouldnt make trip
top atmosphere
decay h
hit earth make
well theyre traveling
fast clock running
different speed thats amazing
actually dont know
better einstein right rel
time time dilation right earth
gotta love science people
got love yeah cant argue
blow gasket every
got let got recover
phenomenal muon
behave like electron right yeah yeah
except could posi one well
theyre
different thank
theyre fundamentally different
mean theyve got mass theyre
fundamental particle like electron
thing like yeah theyre
analogous electron yeah
well muon negative
charge electron negative charge
um leave muon alone itll
decay get electron
um way could
could think electron kind
hiding inside muon okay thats uh
thats weird
yeah okay right energetic
phenomenon think
colleague energetic
thing know supern noi mh
there hypernova okay
thing noi h would
big as explosion dont really know
mean supernova
extremely energetic theyre hard
explain badass supernova yeah
youre right near ed
quantifiable magnitude nova supernova
hypernova like would able
understand regular person like
youre regular person let get
straight like yeah know mean
like hierarchy word
correspond hierar
energy youre trying say
thats im trying say like
would explain like okay
nova like 10 nuclear bomb five
hydrogen bomb whatever
could like wish number
think bomb
could could could ever even
imagine bomb imagine
dope mean get 10 53 erg
call type two supernova
explosion thats massive star
thatll explode end black
hole right thats like factor 10
20 nova little
little 10 20 yeah yeah huge
difference fact explosion
correct im wrong emitting
energy star
galaxy explodes yeah thats
something mean think thats right
sun 10 33 erg per second
10 53 total ur yeah thats
10 20th ur one
ive heard add
energy sun ever emit
total lifetime thats
like supernova thats supernova yeah
gocha right huge yeah thats almost
way
youre looking 10 billion 15 billion
year radiation po thats
thats theyre visible
across universe far away
object
galaxy everything ive
studying lately
galaxy ive also studied
galaxy nearby one mostly
ive started getting galaxy
cluster um still nearby cluster
okay theyre getting kind far
away let take moment
record mh year 2024 yes
100 year ago yes hubble man
telescope discovered
alone galaxy universe wow
yeah ended great debate didnt
debate ended ended
end great debate okay
great debate spiral nebula
local phenomenon galaxy
whole whole galaxy
whole galaxy like
island universe know
there whole trillion
yeah yeah thats amazing got
control look
mentioned amery moment ago
nutrino namer
nutrino must
italian yeah exactly said
believe discovery
got nutr exact thats chuck speaking
italian way thats yeah thats
every american who italian
speaking italian girl
neutrino theyd nutras right
wouldnt thats cool yeah
im
interested tend name telescope
scientist people
relevant field read
recently fmy telescope
dont know anything could
catch yeah gamay
gamay space telescope space
telescope yeah got space
gamma ray interact
earth atmosphere give
muon yeah yeah pons whole
gam yeah good stuff uh space
first gamay telescope space
telescope uh
predecessor compton gamay
observatory knew okay
size bus really big one
cuz bus fit inside
space shuttle yeah yeah
fit designed
fit
thats size make fit yeah
thats thats whole payload thats
whole thats whole payload right
time may still hold
record heaviest thing
shuttle ever launched really
wow okay need heavy detector
like stop gamma ray
know detect essence
firmy gam space telescope
particle detector okay could also
know direction coming
right thats right detects
photon come one photon
time g photon one phot
photon come uh came
best youre counting one
photon time one time thats
insane rare highest
energy stuff need need something
special create yeah theyre
pretty rare man dish
amount one man
one one got photon
guy guy theyre looking let
tos one
thats pretty wild man mean
talk solar astronomer oh gosh
cant even conversation yeah
like countless photon
coming sun even u
anything star get countless
photon know uh
theyre precious one photon time
okay compton
observatory couldnt firmy
great improvement localization
like figuring direction
uh could pinpoint direction
gamma ray much better
really important cuz think
there whole generation detector
detect something mh
right there information
came detected
right right even worse
compton
would really like say oh detected
gamay crazy source
couldnt quite pinpoint really
come crazy source
uncertainty circle huge exactly yeah
okay youre little better
oh lot better yeah yeah yeah uh
know fraction degree still
sound pretty sloppy observer
space telescope high
value atmosphere
oh yeah detecting one particle
year whatever one lu
okay im happy hear
many total gamay photon
touched life oh thats
plenty plenty okay yeah uh like
saying anytime one
cosmic ray proton hit ambient
proton galaxy full
gas cloud um light oh god okay
yeah actually strong
background strong backgr okay
right use fery telescope
way ive lately studying
well thing cant detect oddly
enough um there there
different gamay youre detecting
gamma ray mean think cant
detect regular telescope
right source
gamay like pulsar star forming
galaxy thing like
know look pulsar
there 5000
detected radio
many detected gamay
source well couple
hundred 300 h
4000 suspected
would also good source
gamma ray looking
gamma ray weaker source yeah
yeah looking
undetected pulsar gamma ray
stacking signal together see
population actually gamma
ray source uh trying trying
know figure
property improving signal
noise data yeah exactly
signal compared noise
trying reduce background every
time stack noise slowly cancel
additive right
ups down cancel
signal however low really
every next time youre gonna boost
amplified amplified every
next time youre gonna tamp
noise right real practice
particle detector like
background always add
oh man get persistent
additional signal source
population stack
beat beat yeah
stack okay uh stack
background compare target
get signal
background yeah okay
inventory object phenomenon
cataloges emerge
stacked data something
pulsar supernova
discovering new kind object maybe
pulsar low gamy
luminosity people say
shouldnt discovering
seeing low
spin theyre called low spin
uh pulsar actually potential
source gamay emission u there
lot dont know
gamay production pulsar come
wacky area magnetosphere
feel good sor
sake people
may know cuz know others yeah
people like
pulsar important
talk spin yeah pulsar
um uh densest kind object
universe measure
superlative like
right densest talking
something couple time mass
sun size queen okay
super compact wild cant go
compact get black hole queen
burrow new york city
international black hole
actually observe right
black hole actually observe
exactly yeah super dense
incredibly high surface
gravity right like 100 trillion time
surface gravity thats keeping u
seat right oh weighed
pound right right youd weigh
100 trillion pound surface
neutron star youd flat flat
exactly right youd g spot spot
thats even flapjack sp
even
tortilla little spot
pulse right pulsing theyre
spinning around really super crazy fast
also fastest spinning thing
spin faster blender okay
double mass sun size
queen size queen spinning faster
blender yeah wow yeah pretty
nut spinning fast could almost
fly piece mean theyre theyre
fast fast spin
high compression
powerful powerful magnetic field
like trillion time higher
magnet thats fridge
generates intense electrical
field thatll accelerate particle
like particle particle
accelerator particle accelerator
universe particle accelerator look
even though surface
gravity high particle
near surface
electron stuff like
um instead falling
surface despite high gravity
get shot almost speed
light intense electric
magnetic field look
mean understand gamy burst
youre saying thats stretch
right gamy burst different
thing uh
stellar explosion like supernova
something happens core
star collapse anytime
scientist say something happens yeah
right gapping ga ignorant there
whole ignorant valley right
there whole world inside
something happens well people
modeling getting pretty good
there student group
master student who
gamay uh burst explosion master
degree
yeah master universe
master class kind cool though
master degree student yes
degree give
astrophysicist master
universe favor
change sure well let let
look cosmic query see
came chuck
right got bring
yeah well let start uh
haywood atlanta georgia say
heywoods asked think heywood
yeah say hello
chuck uh wondering gamay bur
start slowly build time
instantaneous think
mean actual
explosion leadup
there thing slow moving
burst right wouldnt wouldnt
call burst wouldnt call
burst point leading
actual know expulsion
talked whats process
idea process
yeah yeah collapse
massive star black hole
presumably um instead
like spherical explosion
might picture um actually uh
get jet couple jet explosive
material basically blast
star tend
jet tend pointed right u
give um lot gam
high energy emission break
star right second
second pretty really rapid rise
there slight fade
still second maybe ten second
socalled long gamay burst
shorter one much
much quicker ten second thats
longest wa wait know
short anyone witnessed
yeah yeah see light curve
explosion
somebody looking
explodes see
exploding ten second
even though sky vast
enough astronomer world
look every star time
people looking right star
right time well people
fmy gam space telescope
instrument thats looking whole
sky time oh go okay
wasnt pointed observation
broad part survey
survey okay exactly right give
chuck let keep moving let go uh
wara r rama rama say hello
dr tyson professor pagon lord nice
andrew cork ireland
say suppose gaay uh
thousand welcome 100 thousand welcome
im going try pronounce
sorry buddy uh go question
today explain
property largest molecular
cloud galaxy influence star
formation rate overall dynamic
galaxy love okay thats
great question thats really great
question yeah started
gamma ray uh
studying star formation giant
molecular phd yeah yeah fact
there word gamma ray
went phd thesis um one
paper grad student
one highly cited paper
kind funny
gaming waiting fmy get
launched yeah star formation happens
giant molecular cloud
thats thats action
yeah property molecular
cloud definitely determines
play wow uh
phenomenon like dont know
collision black hole pulsar
ejection particle
excited jetted across
universe ever perturb
know like cloud thing
cause something observe
know interesting youre
talking black hole
im im rolling head
im like cosmic ray
weve talking
penetrate molecular cloud
deeper anything else okay
provide source heat weve
noticed molecular cloud
little hotter one might predict
really coolor
seems always
additional source ionization source
heating cosmic ray
source okay one
thing keep going cosmic ray
astrophysics seeing
contribution cosmic ray
galaxy evolution uh molecular cloud
evolution star formation mc cloud
huge mean lot
gravity enough gravity
influence cloud
thing interesting uh mean
merge stuff
tend really know subject
overall dynamic galaxy
theyll follow g um
gravitational potential galaxy
right ilium ilium say hello
dr tyson professor pelon anyone else
might
thanks title lord true
yes uh here question beautiful
portland oregon limited
knowledge uh gamma highest photon
energy encountered
universe also produced
photon much higher level
particle accelerator earth
equipment use study
capacity detect
differentiate
particle truth
really cant compete
cosmos man totally u beat
cosmos sense
im sure youre personifying
universe lhc able bang
together proton think like 14
uh terra electron volt
whole crapload electron volt
high energy weve got
source work thousand
time higher thousand time yeah
getting cosmic ray uh
gamma ray seeing
source truly dont
understand
energetic isnt best evidence
large hydron collider would
create many black hole would eat
earth turned switch oh
thats interesting question yeah
energetics collider
though high pale compared actual
collision happening actual
atmosphere yeah cant worry
thats going turn u
black hole higher energy
reaction happening right
u time time yeah
make sense think record 20
teev highest energy photon
detected earth might might
higher requires process
particle thats even energetic
theyre theyre
cant touch cant
touch cant touch
kayla b uh badu say
salutation lafayette louisiana
kyla curious gamma ray
telescope exactly work
used investigate
never hear know come
cuz dont make pretty picture
got uh people like picture
yeah thats true three photon
today make headline oh yeah
picture kind grainy um ill
admit know usually tim
thats there photoshop yeah yeah
artist impression yeah know
particle detector particle
come go uh
layer tungsten basically
itll create particle antiparticle
pair pair travel
tracker socalled tracker
let u know came
oh land
silicon calorimeter
energy measurer um thats way
work right thats super cool man
tell tell u calorimeter
particle eventually end
calorimeter thats thats
overall measuring total energy
okay gotcha like collection plate
know like said get three
thing root calorie right yeah
calorie energy calorimeter calorie
heat yeah energy energy energy
right yeah exactly manifest
manifest heat energy
excellent technically heat exchanged
energy gotcha yeah cool right
see specific scientist
people see pain as
facilitates efficient
communication cannot disagree
thing right right go
christopher stow say hi
chrisen pennsylvania question
chemistry occurs
huge cloud complex chemistry
occurring nebula
material diffused happen
guy know he talking
thats really insightful dude know
he talking diffuse
extremely diffuse might dense
molecular cloud might
thousand particle cub centimeter
size know thats
much dont interact lot
die mean dice dice one one one dice
right yeah chemistry
slow gas phase chemistry
really slow slow
separation among frequency
interaction low yeah
experimenting sensibly happening
sensible time scale yeah cant
make compound two atom
dont meet know yeah
slow happens get
complex molecule slow
molecular cloud dont live long oh
yeah million year theyre little
transient gotta im sorry
astronomical time scale thats
thats fast right okay
go dont live happens
well could collapse form
star could dissipate
disrupted theyre turbulent
could fly piece okay yeah
okay right uh
saa
minin saa minkin say hello im
guessing yeah mean
im guessing sa minkin
okay uh hello
distant snowy land finland name
saia minkin pronounce saia oh
guess got right okay
wrong first time said
maybe uh last name sorry cant
help chuck
okay jack
jackass right go sa here
question region
galaxy star born die
quickly could star burst
way considered vital function
galaxy word
act breathing pulse
galaxy shaping life cycle
evolution boy sound like
youve working neil
yeah thats great question
kind thing
got galaxy cluster
project galaxy galaxy
form uh infalling gas thing
like there also
process feedback get
supernova explosion thing like
stellar wind
happening one burst like
get giant super bubble
galactic scale wind coming
galaxy um receding
neighborhood even turning
star formation regulated
feedback mechanism thats wild
also generate cosmic ray
carry away bunch energy well
another thing ive looking
cool great question saia way
go ill forgive making fun
right uh michael kemp
say greeting dr tyson lord nice dr pon
pon uh p pon sorry rhyme telephone
tell p uh michael kemp soggy
oregon coast range southwest
eugene james webb space telescope
imag ton supernova h early
universe early supernova uh
different one occurring
universe today thanks
lot would make change
wow great question uh
actually big problem uh assume
theyre supernova
know love one
really familiar
nearby kind hoping
probably
understand theyre like right
he referring though there
dozen new transient discovered
jameswood space telescope
thing thatl trans yeah thing
blinked went away oh get
yeah dont repeat transient like
explosion thats wild mhm okay thats
thats crazy though presumed
theyre supernova actually
still think theyre still studying
heck okay
really new stuff mean guy
yeah he stuff way go
michael kemp look impressed
doctor okay right
gavin bamber say hello north
vancouver please visit u okay thanks
invitation expecting plane
ticket
uh son star formed
de debris massive star
many dying star
take form new
star interesting yeah
definitely second generation
sun definitely second generation
star call population one
star even though second generation
two came first dont know
pop two came first pop one came
second yeah okay deal thats
weird there pop three also
first
star thats ridiculous anyway well
sun definitely pop one star
heavier element like
magnesium whatnot know
thing come uh exploding star
know evolved stellar
thing yeah sure
debris lot different star
though um know
star explodes throw
outer layer giant thing
like know go back
interstellar medium eventually
form another giant molecular cloud
form next generation star
fall form star thats
pretty well next gen next gen gen
x love let start
naming population one two thats
catchy yeah really start
right uh alysa feld house alysa
alysa feld ho say alyssa
rocket city huntsville uh dr pon
trace feature younger
galaxy directly early
starburst galaxy might
considered
progenitor galaxy observe
today pray tell
favorite candy named thanks
keeping okay starburst
starburst right
desk nice look
mean answer question
short yeah know
youre real astrophysicist
office see starbursts sitting
around anyway want one
go think thats cool name
im marketing uh marketing
firm guy yeah yeah
went yeah astronomy uh neil
wrote long time ago
know use simplistic naming
know super fancy
name there burst
star formation galaaxy call call
starburst galaxy know get
right point yeah mean
earliest galaxy forming lot
star smaller obviously
really messed uh yeah
try make connection
star formation rate earlier
universe lot higher
today know thing
definitely interested
trying tie together cool
time one question chck
right let go buddy alejandro
reno
he hackin sack new
jersey big king alejandro roso
monter
mexico hello say hola
there
oh say question
massive star behave
different son
difference die
also theyre born
live everything yeah
massive star everything fest
let talk theyre born
thats pretty dog interesting
well way sun
low mass star born collapse
molecular cloud right
massive star faster
mass mass
gravity happens faster
right im big giant fat
superstar im burning away baby
differently
kind star
differently like brown
dwarf like little boring as brown
dwarf star burning away baby
talking
burning yeah burning
sun core clear
dont use word burn way
chemist course course
wouldnt chemist burn chemical
reaction right usually involving oxygen
right exothermic release
say burn right dont mean burn
really mean well
reacting mean thermonuclear fusion
fusion yes loose tongue
loose tongue guilty
slipped okay
youre
thermonuclear fusion yes talking
hydrogen burning right thats
hydrogen burning thats sun
yeah burning hydrogen
creating helium right helium
helium whats whats big fat guy
enough mass
compress core higher temperature
burn helium carbon
oh even better burn carbon
oxygen oh even better next one
next one next one
get iron theyre
making element yeah
burn yep whoa
nucleosynthesis
nucleosynthesis
part dying process
become explode thats living proc
living process interesting yeah
one energetic
process burn fast even
though know mass
would think oh fuel
tank youd last longer
burn really really fast way fter
yeah theyre super luminous mean
could um thousand time uh
luminous sun theyre
shining theyre giving energy
much faster size compensate
longevity burn
quicker burn quicker oh
might last 10 million year oh
yeah instead trillion right yes
yeah star
formation happening massive star
formation instantaneous see
massive old massive star
look arent
better burnout fade
away
whats thats thats thats
highlander yes another one
really thats highlander two
catchphrase
one number one
catchphrase antihero
movie thats line better
burn fade away song
better burn
fade away still young oh
young hey hey favorite highlander
line actually hurt doesnt
stab
neck thats favorite yeah cuz
kind cruel cuz know wont die
stabbed neck okay hurt
doesnt wow big giant star
live fast die young absolutely
awesome yeah even though
fuel even though fuel
theyre like gas guzzling l yachs
1960s 70 like think
bigger gas tank would
go far smaller gas tank
got better gas mileage thats right
analysis cool uh let see
reflect conversation yeah
cosmic perspective okay
always fascinated science
general astrophysics
particular thing
know love see
telescope detector
hypothesize whats get
better data figure
realize youre still
limited power
tool
wait actually wait
bigger telescope come along better
telescope come along powerful
particle accelerator come along
could reach
zone universe
previously
unknown
clever
already know got bring
engineer point build
thing able even see
never imagined even possible
thats significant growth
field come brilliant
people thinking stuff already
know come brilliant
technology could take u
weve never
occasion weve never even dreamt
thats cosmic
perspective tim thanks coming hey
thank thanks making trip
upstairs rose center
earth space hayden planetarium
american museum natural history
thats visitor office right
youre based york college
thats right yeah thanks coming
time youre chuck always good
see man always pleasure right
star talk cosmic query
extreme energy edition next
time keep looking
music
