discover expanding universe
expanding vast every
metric weve ever established
thing vast size
temperature speed get
feel take tree expand
size observable
universe plank scale would
expand roughly size atom
plank scale atom
tree universe
quickly lead even greater
existential dread run
movie backwards get point
seems quite catastrophic
galaxy literally top
eventually youre kind
imagining something thats dense
start thinking hot
soupy chaotic reason
cant put quantum mechanic
already seems quantum
mechanic embedded deep subtle
way einstein didnt
recognize oh please tell cuz edible
kicked fascinating
cant put something something
dont know
inside thing find
going like
yo thats like
told put
already thats simple
elegant profound
amazing agree
music
maybe photon
pulled maybe space
warped photon like surfing
space like yeah
man wave awesome
see curve right thats
case
um cant escape black hole
mean space
inside black hole folded
even photon cant get
yeah essentially
sparkly
want morpheus say
cant morpheus said
said im morphe
stupid conversation ever hear
guy sing really really low
voice like profundo
profundo profundo like
almost see vocal cord vibrating
oh god thats pretty good oh look
im live
hi j nice hey richie number one hey
man
crowd ready got
got
dont back sit
got butt sticking like
1920
didnt know
galaxy oh wow yeah mean
thought main character
whole milky way
universe oh yeah yeah emanuel khan
even 1700s imagined
fuzzy thing island
universe cant hear name without
stop saying stop okay island
universe
think uncommonly fast
wondering maybe
see yeah okay
want double check he
getting little he getting knuckle
youre pretty fast let
see
music
oh man thats right okay
damn
nice nice got
music
begin want didnt
know today two
actually current collaborator
research could
highlight
mean brian
working together year mostly
weve thinking extra spatial
dimension different cosmological
implication implication
theoretical physic know hiding
dark energy extra
dimension one one
yes youre youre thinking higher
dimension yes three
plus time dimension enough
well know even einstein
started working wondered three
mean curious question
start well magic number yeah
favorite number wait
schoolhouse rock people right
count three got
right away
okay many dimension
really uh dont know certain
theory tell u could much
one meet eye
could many 10 11 oh
like gender
laughter
said im getting
arrested
make dimension
mean sound like youre pulling
as mean sorry
yeah didnt deny
immediately worried
okay well partly
also deep mathematical reason
lead u idea yeah
know figure nature uh try
experiment every
possibility might actually happen okay
exploring right
much weed guy smoke
right complete silence
microscope telescope
invented 400 year ago like said
take u grandest vision
understanding place
universe tiniest vision
also give u understanding
place universe
first step magnified dawn
20th century especially
1920s let let start
large well end
small okay let go back
roaring 20 let
here something hard even
believe 105 year ago
didnt know
galaxy
thought star
night sky
milky way entire universe
werent given reason
think anything fuzzy
thing sky okay theyre
fuzz call nebula latin
fuzz yes thank
thought space lint
yeah yeah yeah fuzz
lint space mess nebula
nebula spiralshaped
others irregular
irregular one found
plane galaxy
whereas spiral one every
direction looked interesting
odd first thing
well maybe unpack
figure whats going
famous debate took place 1920
national hosted national
academy science
heber curtis yes unfortunate name
name harlo chappley
soon become director
harvard college observatory heber
curtis director alagany
observatory two different yeah
im going say one sound
expensive right
debated whether spiral thing
galaxy
term coined emanuel kant
1700s thought
philosopher
yes chuck brian brian
man im sorry brian
know cant hear
name emanuel kunt without
12 year old okay im sorry
okay he philosopher deep
thinking philosopher looked
saw spiral object
thought possible island
universe oh thats thats pretty
cool island universe thats
beautiful didnt
evidence say support
deep idea time
debated
based evidence hot
taken theyre scientist okay
right mean sometimes
rosecolored glass towards past
yes get get here
work two scientist argue
there pact implicitly signed
even begin either
youre right shes wrong youre
right he wrong youre
wrong know going
conversation nerd thunderdog
two scientist enter
two scientist leave one little
embarrassed
payperview saturday night yeah
here
tyson jake paul real kind
throwdown let go harvard
fellow yeah cuz always tell
harvard man cant tell
much
oh got got
insufferable back well got
also like went school
boston
say say
say know dont know
right back here
happened let merch uh shappley
heavily invested entire night sky
part whole
universe milky way
evidence time fellow
astronomer looked spiral
nebula claimed found
moved sky
youre really really far away
thats essentially impossible
measure youre close
youre moving see
movement okay thing close
example see
plane moving across sky
see bird moving angle
dont conclude bird going
600 mph bird much closer
much lower speed see cross
field view closer
evidence suggested spiral
nebula nearby bet
horse wrong horse
good
scientist took data put
confidence data later
shown data basing
argument false
could verified work
scientist fact
spiral nebula motion across
sky shappley wrong
later would later show he
wrong
put nail coffin
1923
edwin hubble oh man hubble
person telescope yeah
thought thought born
telescope born telescope
yeah like youre kid
youre like course
ninja turtle birthed
yeah
idea based evidence
turned wrong
evidence flawed there
lesson right
one scientist one bit evidence
dont alert authority yet
there confirming
experiment uh
peer review thats
peer review
way anybody want know uh
scientist hater okay
come something
somebody go call
wait
wait neil neil peer review
u nonscientists basically
scientific group chat
present takeer information
17 friend group
chat get like like
sapply green bubble
chat thats oh godamn
god damn horrible
horrible life live one
green one green surrounded
blue
yeah idea
shown wrong yeah
wrong fact einstein
relativity well get
couple minute uh hard
accept people right
know hard
counterintuitive
someone came work saying 100
einstein
100 einstein he
rumored say see
learned anecdote he
rumored said 100 im
wrong one would enough
wow yeah pretty great yeah
believe ive married 27
year right
good enough
okay here happened edwin
hubble curious spiral
nebula find star
match kind star thats
nebula thats sort nearer
star
specific kind variable star uh named
first kind sephiid
variable uh first kind
found constellation sephiius
thats categorize type
variable star first one
constellation others matter
find variety
found sephiid variable
tell u whats special
sephiid variable well
predictable property
luminosity bright shine
related sort oscillation
tell uh youre
looking precisely one
easily identifiable get
luminosity yeah
say see period vary
right based period know
bright bright
though knew
light bulb right tell
bright light bulb far
away dim light bulb close
right distinguish
two distinguish two
know nothing light
bulb know everything
light bulb yes know exactly
say oh
know light bulb know exactly
far away say star
particular luminosity
way dim mhm
far far away know
everything happens space space
happening spaceime four
dimension spacetime never
time without place vice
versa say meet need
know time make
happen regardless place
throughout entire universe well
would like give gift
spacetime suppose told could
mark occasion beautiful
physical representation
corresponding spacetime well thanks
friend underlucky star
underlucky star make
beautifully designed star map show
unique alignment star
place date chosen whether
birthday engagement wedding
first met star never
look twice star map
personalized unique title
footnote three
child gave one
birthday star map one
message sky
morgan entered universe
sky aiden entered
universe sky
charlie entered universe
love mother
brother sister father wife child
best friend even bos
know youre kind employee
youre giving
unique commemoration significant
life event always
cherish dont wait even go
super meta give star map
day gave star map
right okay maybe im prone
little extreme perhaps youll
start important date go
underluckystarscom
immortalize happiest moment
life thats underluckystarscom
back spaceime
show important know
actually meant hubble
never convinced
actually galaxy proved
something beyond
outskirt galaxy knew
galaxy 100000 lighty year
across analysis showed
900000 lighty year update
2 million lighty year hubble
conservative
unwilling say island
universe galaxy
right idiot
wait whats difference
space real estate standpoint whats
difference island universe
galaxy talking
theyre poetically identical theyre
theyre poetically
identical got yeah okay yeah
galaxy
universe there another galaxy
get call universe
except see full breadth
got reallocate use
word universe
cuz universe
one
one verse right
multiverse
spiderman well get
okay yeah yeah yeah well get
right minus
spiderman well well well well
didnt like second one
thought great jana
reeling fact
universe part
universe year
later hubble
discovers spiral nebula
motion body soul whats
going yeah he
starting able use sephiid
variable standard candle
get strong sense far away
thing start
start kind mapping
local environment
right nearby also galaxy
away little smudge
sky begin catalog
galaxy
around u great distance
also seem receding away u
largely predominantly yeah
make plot make plot
strange mean youre looking
enormous galaxy
galaxy collection hundred
billion star theyre pretty
localized maybe theyre spiral
uh blob theyre far away
theyre also moving away u
every direction peculiar
make plat completely
freaky get freakier
away faster theyre
expanding away u theyre
calculating without computer
well hundred billion people
called computer back
sure yeah look old
dictionary look word computer
person make person
computes yes wait uh there
room full yes theyre
without machine room full
computer harvard time yes
actually us work one
harvard computer woman
named henrietta levit um
part group woman worked
harvard observatory called
like
well called pickerings harum
charles pickering one point
frustrated male
computer fired
said maid could better job
hired maid willamina
fleming great job
um hired woman
one henrietta levit
made 30 cent hour
go ahead
applauding pay
weird 30 cent hour thats
making iphones
okay
said said
right mixed weve
got simultaneous thing going
einstein general theory relativity
already race okay
came 1915 15 okay gave u
mechanism understand whole
universe could catch u
well einstein writes
equation 1915 initially
applies thing like motion
earth around sun
terrestrial nearby motion local
thing
creative thinker one particular
belgian priest named george lamemetra
decides apply mathematics
something universe
entirety universe find
equation universe
expanding time
clear able
based training priest
priest physicist
priest physicist doubt
interest applying idea
entirety universe
distinct focus big
question existence werent
separate although
mind clear said
two way deep insight
world there mathematics there
salvation said let follow
thats
intermingled clear
line sand
absolutely yeah wait
matra
ill let ill let guy figure
pronunciation take
equation expanding
universe lamatra
lumatra predicts expanding
universe using einstein equation
yes einstein could made
prediction didnt yeah fact
1917 einstein actually got
first applied equation
entirety space
disturbed couldnt get
universe met philosophical
prejudice universe
fixed eternal static unchanging
would anybody think universe
could anything well
mean book called genesis
seems suggest beginning
okay people
think perhaps vision
correct einstein many others
time firmly believed
universe could change largest
scale thats
philosophical bias totally
fact heat change wait wait wait
wait could could get away
galaxy
gravity feel
others gravity would collapse
one point yeah
argument isaac newton actually
gave hundred year earlier
universe infinitely big
galaxy spread across
infinity space
center collapse toward
envision static universe
infinite infinite
even
einstein general
relativity recognized basically
issue youre raising finite
universe said let introduce
repulsive push counter
attractive pull gravity
antigravity antigravity force
field called cosmological constant
introduces math
1917 1915 equation
introduces static
universe allow breathe
easy fulfill philosophical
bias mantra say
expanding universe
einstein react einstein learns
lametra 1927
say lamera calculation
correct physic
abominable
oh fighting word
fighting word wait
saying cant trust every
mathematical calculation tell
something real reality math
math textbook
interesting nothing
mathematical curiosity say
lmetra idea expanding
universe thats mathematical
curiosity real okay
1929 hubble discovers expanding
universe happens next
well interesting
way originally described kind
confusing might think make
seem like center
expansion everythings receding away
u way hubble law
specifically much like
space every galaxy actually
stretching point view
one
galaxy would also look like
everything
right everythings receding away
imagine
galaxy literally moving spacetime
actually distance
galaxy thats stretching
something away actually
moving away faster there
space stretching
really closer latras description
even closer simply wasnt
static im clear
time believe there one
galaxy approximately 1925
im following feel like im chris
nolan right im watching tenant
let let pause real quick
23 24 one galaxy one
galaxy wasnt one universe
one universe copy yes
2025 understand yes
there many many universe
talking island
universe talking universe
universe im talking whole
oh good god there one universe
know filled 100 billion
galaxy order
100 billion star
theoretical idea neil
suggesting might get tomorrow uh
speak possibility
might universe answer
dont know sure data
seems suggest there one
universe well talking
backstage del delta
big two number
one basically said
gajillion
know know
living right data
know right isnt going
wildly 50 year 100
year theyll like look
dumb dums 2025 hope hope
thats happen thats
live live stupid
live wrong scientist
oh got
lived iran scientist
got okay well let let
follow reasoning
discover expanding universe
expanding mean bigger today
yesterday bigger
yesterday day
logically take u
bigger going back time
oh im sorry yeah
youre already disturbed lack
permanence universe
quickly lead even
greater existential dread
run movie backwards everything
closer together
keep running movie backwards
get point seems quite
catastrophic galaxy
literally top
eventually youre kind imagining
something thats dense
start thinking hot uh
soupy chaotic
lamontra call
yeah latra basically said look
math saying universe
expanding today hubble
data show universe
expanding today wind cosmic
film reverse run film
backwards thing get closer
closer together suggests
there point distant past
everything top everything else
call primeval atom
beginning according
description okay happen know
astronomer active
time brilliant guy named fred hy
universe would
changing yeah knew universe
expanding couldnt reason away
accepted yeah accepted
youre expanding youre
always must mean matter
spontaneously created
void create new galaxy
statistically universe always look
yeah know here
thing universe expanding
change would
accept changing universe cuz
wanted always look
time eternity
past future
philosophical bias think idea
beginning particularly
disturbing wow idea
primeval atom literatur scientist
religious people god
made universe theyre perfectly
happy beginning look pope
pius 12th perhaps nerdiest pope
history love science wait wait
know dont know
took took lmetras work
said scientific evidence
genesis thats said
lmetra heard threw
fit belgian priest lmetra pope
talking directly yes
catch wind
pope saying one
student class
lmetra teach afternoon
learning said lamemetra
normally quiet
mildmannered came ranted
45 minute whole point
blending religious life
scientific life pope
taking scientific work he
turning religion notice
said student
pope
dont want know galileo
situation exactly yeah
tamer version quote
far see theory
primeval atom remains entirely outside
metaphysical religious question
yeah thats couple drink
chill
okay got called big
bang fred hoy fred hy yeah
fred hoy 1948 bbc radio
interview know level
detail okay
describing approach
mentioned steadystate approach
matter created spontaneously
fill gap space
ask approach
say oh theory
matter must created one
big bang thats idea
big bang theory come people
interpreted derogatory
description way recounting
story simply trying
draw distinction theory
steady state little
bit matter created air
cross space versus theory
like one hydrogen atom per century per
cubic lightyear mean there
small rate quite small
one atom per century per
olympic size swimming pool oh okay
thought bigger
thats need
kind whole universe yeah
yeah yeah whats
believable one little atom form
cubic know swimming pool
size arena space per century
there moment everything
created framing
way theory sound perhaps little
bit believable less less crazy
yeah yeah assume
big bang got
assume expansion
uniform whole time doesnt
uniform yeah change
time well thats always
expanding always expanding okay
unless there extra dimension
might right well could
expand differently enough brian
talking later well
yeah squeeze
dimension could
chaotic mixing expansion
contraction overall overall
volume universe expanding
way get looking
rate universe
expanding yes slope
graph hubble first derived
there slope called
letter c constant
since swapped
capital h hubble call
hubble constant famous hubble
constant constant space
mean important time
really hubble parameter
call change time
could faster
early universe faster future
right hubble wrong
turned uh sephiid variable
used
didnt know time
two variety sephiid variable
one thats near u one
see far far away
presumed reason
think otherwise got wrong
distance wrong expansion rate
universe sephias like
diabetes type one type two yes
there type one type two
exactly think
music
maybe exactly
yes there literally type one sephiid
type two sephiate got
use apple apple youre
exercise got age
universe two billion year
would later refine number uh
graduate school many moon
ago uncertainty hubble
constant factor two
10 hubble
constant run film backwards
ask much time expansion rate
looking backwards get
time zero mhm make sense well
yeah everybody
place time thats
perfectly sensible question got
two number two camp okay
10 billionyear camp 20 billion
year camp fac whole factor two
everyone know fighting
know cant
right need better data one
goal wait isnt isnt
10 billion quite bit thats
lot comedian
took physic one undergrad
advance dont want smoke
saying 10 billion
lot here thing like go
dinner split im
like big delta im
im yeah im 100 yes yes
arent like lose science
little thing know
mean like could disbarred
yeah here thing know
get talk here
thing 10 billion
get talk still here
thing like dad
living room he giving
opinion politics get
run mouth continuously
got go ahead
dad thing
im little mad
capital scientist okay
go ahead uh second
question go ahead universe
vast yes time yeah space
vast every metric weve ever
established thing
vast size
temperature speed gravity
im factor two
10 billion 20 billion yeah
could factor 10
factor thousand factor
million quite happy
sandbox
conversation kind kind
like jeff bezos know im
10 billion eh bad
also ask second
philosophical question
real
like either 10 billion
20 billion asking
backstage number
big almost like united
statess debt theyre like
deficit 28 trillion youre
like even matter
gajillion manilion like
matter cuz feel like
freshman im done going
matter awful lot
laughter
would would say actually 10
billion actually quite good 10 20
much ballpark
run federal reserve
yeah yeah stage
know know good way
think could
trillion well future
going much much longer
past though
universe kind expire within
another 10 billion year like
confined number future
could huge number could
living time 10
billion give perhaps one
good answer
perhaps one way looking
youre saying bad question bad
question great answer bad
question dont care whether 10
billion 20 billion number
doesnt matter matter
thats american answer
way thats american answer
yeah truth dont care
want theory work want
theory make prediction match
observation thats thing
matter u actual answer
come whether 10 billion
50 billion 42 like youre saying
doesnt matter need
consistent description
evidence know
evidence matter
side could right right
hubble telescope launched
okay im getting graduate
school launched number one
goal set telescope
resolve discrepancy
telescope named guy gave
u hubble constant first
place within two three year
nailed hubble constant
value would give u age
universe 14 billion year
comfortably two
extreme thats science working
best there limit
much keep beating
head let
let get data let build
telescope thatll solve
fact today similar argument
happening 20 billion
10 billion say
factor two 100 difference
5 difference
understand thing well
two group 5 apart describing
number year billion year
past thats precision
within 5
people kill
dont care exact
number care describe
level precision
talking event happened
billion year ago thats
mindbending here issue
10 20 billion
always report uncertainty
number science
uncertainty little bit
overlap middle landed
expected land
two waring faction
value hubble constant two
number within 5
uncertainty tight yeah
uncertainty dont overlap
look go google search hubble
tension thats come
adam ree coming pioneer work
october planted ad coming
adam ree who nobel prize one
nobel prize winner discovered
universe expanding
expansion getting faster
accelerating part hubble
tension debate uh speaking
pioneerics h without without
waxing without waxing philosophical
dont want miss point
actually saying
make science incredibly great
exactly uh
demonstrated pursuit
truth based upon best available
information time okay
wrong right
going get yes
got
right
turning clock back
get big bang
universe large scale universe described
general relativity small
small extend equation
go back universe size
atom quantum physic apply
entire universe atom
well point
feel invoke quantum mechanic
understand happening
big bang energy scale
dramatic um really
probing quantum physic high energy
youre really looking somewhat
surprisingly small scale um
still trying grapple
big bang telling u uh
potential understand general
relativity kind quantum variant
thing yeah
got general relativity got
quantum physic make nice
sandbox thats deep
difficult question one
many others spent life
trying answer fully
answer yet let restate
yeah others
spent life failing answer yes
okay agree think guy
hear ah take okay
got fan right go
exactly case take
einstein equation general
theory relativity try
invoke quantum mechanic within
calculation eloquently
noted youd youre talking
whole universe
incredibly small need einstein
general theory relativity
whole universe also
need quantum physic
small thats theory
describes small thing
try simply put equation
together get one answer
almost calculation
infinity might sound oh
thats interesting big deep
mystical number nonsense
infinity nature way grabbing u
lapel slapping u around
saying youre something wrong
youve got figure ive
heard another one thats affinity
god divide zero yes yeah
stephen hawking yes yeah oh stephen
hawking said well least thats
he attributed okay okay
youre saying dont make
nice sandbox yeah
there limit whats plank
length whats going well
plank length scale
named mox
plunk uh love say
mox dont know
think say max plank max okay uh
well hundred year ago early
discovery quantum mechanic
uh thinking whether universe
discrete really
continuum um looked
instance air room
look closer closer find
actually made individual
molecule moving around
actually continuum water
um thinking thing
word mortar
infinitely divisible get
molecule point eventually
get individual quantum little
particulate discrete bundle um
thinking sort
fundamental scale
would say definitely
longer think um way
ignoring quantum scale
forced brians describing beyond
definitely going strike
infinity plunk length
trouble really um
trying understand theory
gravity quantum level maybe
mean spaceime coming little
individual bundle dont even know
think im
thinking correlation
little tiny spaceime coming yeah
wild wild
sentence yeah
game throne
space time coming
well mean came big
bang mean moment
space time fact created um
thinking thing
continuum spaceime brian
big smallest unit uh plank
length 10 minus 33 cm
know question well
know think something
well matter
10us 33 10us 31 dont
care exact value thats
mathematics take u
get feel
take atom uh well let take
tree take tree expand
size observable universe
tree yes plank scale
10us 33 centimeter would expand roughly
size atom plank
scale atom tree
universe thats tiny distance
talking
im going channel
measure measure
ruler yeah know im
going channel channel
right channel im im
going even pretend like
understand whats happening right
im going 100 honest there
like 3500 people im like
dont act like know im going
channel lost facetime
coming way came
quite hot brian youre like
know youre thinking thats
thinking thinking
think really incredible let
quick little tangent
think really incredible
almost 900 pm many people
went ticketmastercom
paid fee way back
yes way yeah guy
paid ticket learn space
nebuli really
heartening thats
thinking brian
actually like know people say
country going math
science alltime low im
like know math
science lover feel theater
know thing could
900 pm im
challening hassan sure
confidence
know whats happening scale
small dont dont oh
okay thats answer thats end
thank oh chuck come back thank
guy dont know anything
could whole lot good
night take care thank beacon
let see unpack
yeah um true going
figure right okay
sure true every prediction
weve ever made quantum physic
weve able test come
true absolutely okay true
general relativity already know
boundary
calculation cannot make
infinity problem absolutely
therefore one going
succumb sound like
einstein he going
bow quantum he gonna
bow bend knee bend
knee quant either quantum
absorb einstein there higher
level understanding thatll absorb
would say thats true
also quantum isnt competition
theory matter instance
nuclear force understand
quantized right theory
electromagnetism quantized
law physic quantum
mechanic regime
understanding highest energy
attribute law physic
gravity einstein general relativity
replaced theory gravity
theory spaceime theory
geometry replace newton theory
gravity replaces newton theory
gravity one force
sit matter force
classical regime meaning regime
dont worry
quantum mechanic thing look smooth
understand general relativity work
beautifully regime sound political
dictator dictator
sound ussr sound
unfortunately everywhere okay got
okay go
early universe like big bang
course black hole
thing start get extreme
want able quantize
law quantized
thing going replace
grav exactly going replace
gravity want quantize gravity
seemed like perfectly
reasonable request okay wait
einstein equation quantized
require continuum yes
quantize gravity good jan
describing history
insightful useful
equation electricity magnetism
came maxwell able
blend quantum mechanic giving
u quantum electronamics work
equation describing strong
weak nuclear force able
embed quantum mechanic
theory work wonderfully well
try play exactly game
einstein theory gravity
general relativity try put
quantum mechanic quantize
doesnt work
mean mean youre smart
enough well interesting
could smart enough
im full well willing take
ultimate answer there
lot evidence allow come
right till today moment
know wanted go
centennial go ahead yeah
evidence today einstein
general relativity reason
cant quantize reason
cant put quantum mechanic
already seems quantum mechanic
embedded deep subtle way
einstein didnt recognize oh
please tell cuz edible kicked
fascinating
mean youre saying right
revolutionary youre saying
cant put something
something thing
dont know inside
thing find
going like yo
thats like
told put
already okay amazing chuck
blew gasket got
like thats like thats
simple elegant profound
amazing agree
right let let back back
roaring 20 want go
list completely freaky
thing quantum physic prescribed
defied anybodys common sense
still freaky mhm
fact whats quote
fineman quantum physic
say yeah
think quantum mechanic
without getting dizzy havent
understood single single thing
oh understand well
okay 1923
wave particle duality proposed
yeah thats kind freaky mhm
particle also wave yeah
prince louisie de bruy basically
prince yeah said
look 1905 einstein showed u
light thought wave
actually need described
particle socalled photoelectric effect
thats went5 1905
1923 phd thesis louis de bruy
say let reverse electron
always think particle
maybe need thought
wave wow key moment
prince
prince prince dont believe
know current monarchy
intelligent
let honest
harry william youre cooking
youre cooking there
there much incest mean
know understand science
operating level
buying cheated
someone paper buying
phd thesis remember correctly
like 12 page long something
short short yeah got
nobel prize nobel prize pf
got nobel prize 12page phd
phd paper yeah okay let
say thats smartest dude ever
well thats thats know
royalty turned 12page phd
paper theyre like dr prince
he thank
double space 12page phd paper
tighter know margin entitled
piece couple year later
neil im sorry neil
shouldnt shouldnt uh spoken
ill monarch
thats got america
fought war get away monarch
um long
give time
okay
schroinger came around
oh schroer fan
cat cat
cat cat
schroinger u well schrodener
begin think abstractly
whats real whats real
used thinking particle
youve already described deb brogley
electron think
little fundamental particle almost like
billiard ball acting life
concrete existence
schroinger start say well
wave particle duality thats pretty
profound maybe thing
thats real thing called
wave function probability
particle certain
state certain location
moving certain speed
particle sense isnt real
anymore look sometimes
youll find concrete location
really determined
equation law physic
wave function
probabilistic description wave
function occupies physical space
doesnt yeah wave function
occupies physical space
single particle kind
important subtlety one particle
think wave function
filling space two
particle life sixdimensional
space three particle
nine dimensional space
really cant think
ordinary term oh high
okay particle
anywhere barrier
mhm could show
side barrier yeah right
doesnt actually travel
let say barrier concrete
wall there small probability
would find particle well
wave function would describe
probability finding particle
region space doesnt
actually like billiard ball travel
cement wall okay
might thc talking way
guy talking
might one particle
like arent bunch particle
one particle told
blew gasket well
richard feineman idea maybe
one particle circled
around time cycled back
giving appear
many particle there
single particle temporal
cycle youre right target
moving forward backwards
time oh god okay okay
right im saying
particle show side
barrier thats guy
came word
tunneling quantum tunneling
quantum tunnel barrier
thats point
shortinger saying whats real
probabilistic likelihood finding
particle particle
sense concrete
existence anymore challenge
whole nature reality
concretely probability
could calculate yes
likelihood tunneling
stage underneath floor
nonzero probability
kind small unlikely
happen thats quantum
mechanic tell u smaller
get likely happen
exactly happen
laboratory yeah okay
context wow
trying understand sun made
energy calculation
determined sun mostly hydrogen
hottest center said
must undergoing fusion
run math undergo fusion
proton nucleus hydrogen atom
merge another proton
nucleus another hydrogen atom
proton charge
electrostatically like charge repel
moving fast enough
chance
repel stick together form
new nucleus okay calculated
temperature necessary
high temperature give higher
speed calculated temperature
100 million degree
way center sun
going give u 100 million degree
calculate
sensible law thermodynamics
scratching
head quantum physic
come around invent
spooky magical thing called tunneling
discover calculation
mere 10 million degree see
matter 10 million 100 million
mere 10 million degree would
otherwise hit
tunnel connect tunneling
make sun energy production even
possible yeah like
thing
particle physicist worry
laboratory worry
astrophysicist
worried okay okay
sun going sun know
robbins let let sun let
sun thank okay okay
thank neil dont dont blow
thats okay tunneling
there lot tunneling yeah
heisenberg uncertainty
principle thats seems like
biggest thing talk
real fast yeah would
say thats real moment
old way looking world
shown jettisoned
old way looking world
reality reality stuff thats
location moving certain
speed thats way describe
world heisenberg armature
quantum mechanic say cant
actually cant specify
location speed simultaneously
object cant according
quantum equation
language reality used use
longer applies longer applies
cant measure
time well particle
described wave right want
particle definite
location wave highly
spiked say ah almost
100 likelihood location
see notion
velocity come quantum mechanic
wavelength
wave want something
definite speed
definite wavelength thats spiky
definite location need
spike definite speed need
wave different shape
cant time
cant time
try analogy nowhere near precise
brian said sometimes
like musical analogy play
chord whole bunch note
together play chord
cant simultaneously playing single
note chord like
superposition note
relates youre precise
location brians describing
sharp spike youre sort superp
position velocity momentum
like like location
note velocity
chord vice versa know
velocity exactly im playing chord
im longer playing individual im
im playing cant isolate single
individual note im superp
position note
connect
call observer effect
want measure particle right
got look shine light
light sends somewhere
else cant actually ever know
particle right
there two thing one
youre saying look interact
interact say bouncing
photon particle affect
particle need photon
take picture thats right
thats one key point emerges
idea point
never know anything
thats crazy thing
yall went crazy im sorry im
sorry got
right okay quantum mechanic tell u
thing thought
could know thing
know quantum mechanic
weve made prediction anomalous
magnetic moment electron 14
decimal place using theoretical
calculation weve measured
agrees decimal decimal decimal
number thats
love number show u
understand
applause
okay brian blew gasket
know without knowing youre
saying know let say
brian type energy youre
bringing
right wait wait oh man
built cnn type panel smoke
oh fantastic yeah right
one street fighter
square decimal decimal
yeah oh great great
good stuff good
television
go ahead neil
observe effect bring u home
certain widely
mi applied people thinking
consciousness affecting
measurement look big
mystery heart quantum
mechanic even capacity
make calculation agree
observation level precision
emphasized perhaps
unnecessary theatricality
question dont know
answer youre
asking observe seem
able coax one result one answer
even though quantum description
embodies many possibility dont
understand happens
many world hypothesis one
answer shinger equation
beautiful actually
include uh way understand
measurement made yes thats
key point really take
shortage equation seriously
simply say
possibility theyre
dont theory measurement
get u
physic know
proposal people put
mathematical equation answer
question many world
hypothesis many world hypothesis
description
quantum system like particle
quantum wave say 30 chance 20
chance 50 chance
measure dont get one
result there one find
there another one
find there
third one find
different
universe oh rick morty
invented multiple universe
explain something cant otherwise
explain math invented thank
chuck wait wait wait thats
really important guy named hugh
everett 1957 princeton study
math equation janna
made reference schroinger
equation say let
take math completely seriously
see take math
take look paper
direct possibility
multiple universe made
really emerges directly
analysis equation
equation make prediction
confirmed say maybe
take math fully seriously
thats take
passion uh brian
describing like explaining
glitter face
come home art
craft fair
right
right going land
plane soon uh briefly yeah
know spent career
30 second explain string
theory oh god
20 second life meaning go
need 10 look old
picture fundamental
constituent matter little
dotlike particle string idea
maybe theyre little extended
filament introduce
idea introduce idea
quantum mechanic general relativity
play well sandbox
wow okay less 30
second whoa right okay
whats whats future know
astrophysically dont know anything
dark matter dont know
anything dark energy shouldnt
even name dont know
enough even name
called invisible
call called
fred wilma bias
faster light time travel
time travel faster light travel
big bang youre
working peep address
quantum mechanic take
u place need yeah
mean there zero evidence quantum
mechanic crack whatsoever
theory weve written
history
successful theory successful
theory ever give
confidence believe crazy stuff
predicts exactly
pressing ultimately think
putting general relativity quantum
mechanic either theyre already
born together theyre blended
together key answering
question yet
thats exactly headed
need extra
dimension well brian describing
string theory may may
true string theory actually
requires extra dimension make
sense mathematics allow
gravity matter quantum
mechanic play nice together
even without string theory idea
extra spatial dimension
kind natural extension
start think space time
start take seriously
einstein idea
predicament maybe extra
dimension harboring dark
energy maybe there explanation
dark matter
extra dimension
start think extra dimension
dark sector um harboring
really resolution like
observing already dont
direct connection
certain theyre visible plain
sight youre saying yeah
yeah mean theyre literally
visible maybe dark energy
consequence quantum energy
paper brian wrote many year
ago dark energy dark energy
driving universe expand ever
faster something observe
also driving administration
ive got land plane
h go go oh well uh
might observing something
like dark energy indirect evidence
extra dimension cant literally see
cant point
cant move around yet
living consequence
could manifestation
higher order phenomenon universe
part motivation
thinking perfect sense
thank chuck wanted put
button quote einstein
denial quantum physic spite
contributing mightily
field described
probabilistic nature especially
schroingers equation einstein said
god play dice universe
neils boore retorted einstein stop
telling god okay know
dont know uh god need make
money real quick dont know
dice yeah know
see
papa need new universe
like back day scientist
threw
poetically
way know kind
posted use well
good vocabulary work great
vivid language still
today
way im going land
plane offer cosmic perspective
something im prone
exposed much information
think 1920s
uh scientist may
consequential decade ever history
science based influenced
thought trajectory
research would follow
want make slightly different point
1920s
scientist well theyre
sciency thing right lab
there chemical there partic
there material meyer flask yeah
yeah flask thank yes flesh
picture lab okay
um
suppose 1920s
friend relative
politician heard someone
working structure atom
molecule
youll say matter
anyone im carpenter care
wood atom cut
shined polished painted
matter making car
assembly line
matter anybody
youre taking brilliant intellect
applying something nobody
care except cadre people
tell well
foundation matter
theyll tell dont care
youre using
national resource
well
happened every time research
frontier science
basically every frontier science
whatever look like youre
easy say thatll never apply
anything dont
wait little theyre
clever engineer
clever scientist see
problem world see
possible solution
realize today
creation storage
retrieval
digital information without
exploitation quantum
revolution responsible
nearly half gdp world
level
birthed decade time
people exploring edge
understanding world yeah
would take 50 year longer
typical rampd project show
household product
tell know
anyone say much
science science relevant
dont know youre
doesnt sound like make
sense
youre youre cutting
kneecap leg future
wave discovery could transform
civilization take u
might want go possibly solve
problem might created
nothing shortsighted
world anybody running
say less science
every one u room
touched
applause
there greater demonstration
science unfolded
decade 1920s thats
quantum side astrophysics
side birthed understanding
beginning universe
sun make energy would
learn star manufacture element
core
would learn take decade
exploiting quantum applying
realm science
would learn
ingredient body
carbon oxygen nitrogen
iron traceable
star underwent thermonuclear
fusion following rule
quantum physic star
exploded scattered enrichment
across galaxy
creating environment chemical
ingredient make star system
planet planet
life
era gave u
revolution gave u awareness
border spiritual
fact
alive universe
ingredient traceable
star universe alive within
u
applause
music
cosmic perspective
star
live beman theater
like fifth time
beacon theater fifth sixth time
guy marvelous audience
u love
oh thank
uh loving
love support give science
future
civilization without might
well move back cave
always neil degrasse tyson
thanking panel got chuck nice
brian green
chad 11
hassan minaj
neil degrass tyson youre personal
astrophysicist always bidding
keep oh eight knew okay
going one time come
right go whats
tagline let okay neil
grass tyson personal
astrophysicist bidding bidding
keep looking keep looking
go remember he going
go remember eight people
cared guy paid money
rusty currency real number
know brian know exactly much
paid shark ticket
master
he going go neil gyson keep
go looking go
neil degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist bidding keep
keep looking right yes
