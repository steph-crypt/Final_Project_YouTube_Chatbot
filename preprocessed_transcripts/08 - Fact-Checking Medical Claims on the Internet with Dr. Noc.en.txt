misinformation dont believe
hey started early
medical misinformation gary take
got
right well live datadriven

dr knock dr thanks
invitation dude cleancut guy
youve ever seen tell
whitest dude
see dance im saying
appreciate though really
phd youre academic
medical medical professional
call thats right uh
pharmarmacology yeah pharmaceutical
science pharmaceutical science drug
development immunology drug
oh cool man okay drug
invented lab scientist achieve
effect physiology
expertise yes yes excellent
youre definitely social medium
influencer there word
learned today got medfluencer med
influencer better worse
medfluencer got like medical
influencer medfluencer yeah thats
im trying say got
listen trying get clear
word suck let yeah okay
well well get used
thats word get used
youve taken upon
try correct internet
misguided way regarding
medical dos medical choice perhaps
misguided mission yeah thats
goal thats thats great
mission mean know yeah
internet cesspool misinformation
disinformation make
think could mean say
let take whole internet
right whole system yeah
guy um meme he
like brushing back wave
ever see guy push
broom he beach trying brush
back ocean yeah thats
feel like
youve internet
seven six seven year
internet become safe place
misinformation good question
think there transition
obviously print radio
television social medium think
last gap really
democratized anybody sit
car make piece content
cant sit
car make tv show right
right there editorial layer
filter right uh know
bad thing everybody
could get thought
course downside
everyone positive
information false information
right right tightest way
say said uh
problem everyone could get
information
limited tv everyone get
information get
information yeah
there big shift
course entertainment
medical information tik tok
instagram youre competing people
dancing cat dog
everything may presenting
nuanced argument
something youre constrained
make entertaining one
ever going see truth
boring truth boring nuanced
uh take long time say
amazing isnt
find environment
truth exactly need
yet people turned back
doesnt cat
entertaining oh absolutely
mean find work
climate he got second
life he climate advocate yes
yes hard like
succinct entertaining messaging
side stuff like drill baby
drill yeah dont slogan
right slogan slogan great
thats see bumper
sticker work know
make sustainable economy
renewable energy baby doesnt work
doesnt baby yeah right sound
like youve tried though
failed weve got might
also uh echo chamber people
hear want look
information look
understanding information
affirmed google search
youll find youll find there
seven people think exactly
way there false
affirmation
sort people
yeah mean confirmation bias
really confirmation bias really
really hard escape unless youre
thoughtful wont
escape intentional
intentional course take
lot mental energy may
pull instagram usually
youre looking change
opinion something youre looking
spend five minute youre waiting
know train something
really take intentional effort
get type bubble yeah
algorithm still push thing
towards people even though like
confirmation bias wrong
still say let go get
information make
even worse yeah
algor way think algorithm
really people attention like
holding people attention
inescapably platform seek optimize
long people going stay
platform see ad business
model work extremely well
good consumer
interested youre
entertained youre watching
dark side sometimes
thing hold attention
would intellectually
choose tick paper ahead
time want watch video
find slipping
like rage batty content thing
arousing negative emotion yeah
yes yes know whats funny
okay im embarrassed
say found think
producer alex taught
go put
interested say okay
wont show
know didnt know
either yeah there
whole lot crap showing line
im ready im like im
like angry guy every video
somebody beating crap
somebody yeah going like
happening inner
self inner self guess
think there truth
learn lot somebody
looking 10 video feed
something probably one
deepest way know thats scary
yeah yeah
hit interested
although here problem reason
hit interested cuz
watching stuff would come
across id like oh god
tuesday spent whole day
watching people get crap beat
didnt want
topic research ask people
want see negative content
emotional content theyll tell
track happens
theyre come across feed
stick like car crash
know like everyone turn
look head last second
cant almost cant escape watching
content even intellectually
think good
influencer need sensitized
know navigate
create
expectation right
audience gary dont give
u laundry list right
youre fighting
disinformation cant go
platform say know
dont watch dont listen youre
dumb there
immediately causing problem
strategy actually get
across make information
acceptable people wouldnt
necessarily want know let ask
better course
laughter
english anyone listen
as instead anybody else
youre talking medicine online
yeah tension
trying talk people
already agree case
may sort go sensationalized
approach topic people
middle undecided
case may take nuanced
approach discussion want
change mind number two
problem number two
inherently less interesting
speaking people already agree
less good
clickbait
figure strategy first half
second 5 second kind make
entertaining whether ive done
pretty embarrassing video
whole theme video pov
point view dancing party
im like dancing screen im
exploring medical topic
reason im bad dance
move screen keep
entertaining im discussing
clear theyre bad dance move
badass dance move well
clear depends video
something get
people watching mhm right
there there common medical
topic people strong opinion
chosen expert
feed information
compile list right let let
let start one thats
obviously popular cure
cancer keeping secret
always yeah
pharmaceutical
company government researcher
university researcher
collectively ten thousand
hundred thousand people cuz
know easier make money
treatment cure yeah
im like clearly know nothing
pharmaceutical company cuz let
tell something
cure cancer itd like yes
cure 1 million per pill
happens thats part
there there way answer
question one biology
cancer one
pharmaceutical company perspective
one social medium perspective
certainly like youre saying
cure cancer right
cant consider cancer one thing
hundred different disease
never treatment
cancer right
really really good treatment
cancer 50 year ago 70 year ago
survival rate basically 0
common pediatric cancer acute
lymphablastic leukemia allliterally
0 1950s today something like
90 success rate treatment wow
10 patient dont
respond well initially backup
treatment like cartt cell therapy
happen cost hundred
thousand dollar super
effective yeah yeah point
know time research
develop treatment specific cancer
work really well
charge lot money bet
pharmaceutical company could
sell treatment cancer
multiply market size 30fold
would jumping opportunity
right wheres ethical
compass pharmaceutical company
pricing yes yeah believe
twisting mustache
thats compass work
yeah example right
biting pinky
check bank account balance
notify shareholder right part
there limited period
patent exclusivity make
much money try justify
rampd youve done
point get
generic much cheaper
cislatin first testicular cancer
metastic testicular cancer used
super low survival rate researcher
discovered cislatin drug youve
reduced mortality something like
twothirds think since 1970s wow
generic think cost
vial dont know exactly like ten
dollar hundred dollar
get initial period
make lot money new drug
right everybody else get
compete drug see
much time uh cant
remember exact number maybe 10
year 15 year differs chemical
drug biologic drug wait
biology extreme expression
chemistry yeah
distinguishing chemical drug
biological drug chemical drug
like small molecule maybe better
example biologics like antibbody drug
um protein thats
synthesized cell dr vaccine would
come category vaccine
think biologics yeah thats
im saying yeah see stuff like
metastatic melanoma used
median survival time say
used im talking 2000s
like 2010 median survival time six
nine month skin cancer
skin cancer spread
lymph node maybe place
body horrible prognosis
people developed currently
expensive treatment melanin
reason expensive cuz
hard hell black
tell im lying well warning
sun suninduced skin cancer yeah okay
cant totally discount risk
skin cancer course right
precise evidence know
say white people 25 time
likely contract skin cancer
black people
melanin risk zero bob
marley died skin cancer yeah
lightskinned though stop
bottom foot
wasnt sun induced wow wasnt sun
induced yeah yeah back
yes anyway cure
metastatic melanoma 2010 median survival
time 6 to9 month wow today
think almost 10 year wow
difference people
basic translational
research drug called
checkpoint inhibitor modify
immune system immune system
go attack cancer better right
theyre expensive yeah
hundred thousand dollar yeah
theyre currently patent think
patent theyre
going become generic
become less expensive tell
company make right
would love sell every
cancer data
showing worked every cancer
also get reup patent
different us like
modify drug way
treat something else thats brand new
patent there downstream effect
drug find theyve got
application exactly
meaningful cant tinker
try cute say
got new patent people
say well thats
meaningful difference still
going use generic first
drug work well
really make really got
make true alteration
right ah okay make sense
big farmer suppress natural remedy
arent profitable
kind touch weve
discussing yeah shouldnt say yeah
say thats start
question there actually huge
number drug natural
origin ill think
example aspirin good example
think willow bark thousand
year people took turned
salve ointment whatever
property chemist
figured forget year
know active compound
willow bark thats effect
modify little bit reduces
gastrointestinal side effect
sell aspirin clearly
aspirin expensive yet
buffered aspirin
protects stomach lining uh
right cettoic acid yes versus
salicin im chemist okay okay
um sound like one
go ahead basically thats
one example think like forget
number 30 40 drug fda approved
drug natural origin either
directly nature
modified little bit used
much studied
indigenous culture long
tradition healing like
there story people used
plant hundred thousand
year researcher take isolate
compound put huge panel
cancer target example
get psychedelic
found every every culture
found without doubt plant
misconception think
look like pill natural
possible molecule
came bark tree
absolutely hate hear
people say oh natural
remedy im like here
thing everything thats happening
body happening molecular
basis people found
way figure way isolate
molecular compound
thing dont eat
bushel full weed take
pill dummy called progress
anyway sorry okay progressing
raw diet ie raw milk raw meat
healthier theyre natural
weve got caveat
pink himalayan sea salt versus
regular table salt great
closely related answer watch
step himalayan
salt spent lot money
people claim know pink
salt 400 mineral
compared regular table salt
neither first place
supplying meaningful amount
nutrient mineral health
right difference
risk actually think
youre saying 400 time small
number still small number exactly
right 1 versus 4 daily
intake youre getting
eating mango whatever might
otherwise risk people
think pink himalayan sea salt healthy
youre using
food real health impact
second order youre eating
3000 milligram salt per day instead
1500 think giving
health effect right
youd risk hypertension
whatever number one contributor
hypertension salt intake
mean aside heredity like know
first yeah kind
first black let
honest okay let black gonna
get high blood pressure uh
lifestyle sodium
intake know yeah raw milk
similar um there meaningful
benefit consuming raw milk raw
meat compared pasteurized
version people blow
weight proportion think
people get tribalized social
medium people
passionately drink raw milk
otherwise say drink raw milk
youre going die something oh
thats polarization
decision exactly people lived
experience well drink raw milk
time friend
none u died
talking right realistically
know maybe hundred couple
thousand people may hospitalized per
year big risk
unnecessary risk
there benefit drinking raw
milk compared pasturized
people say benefit
reason giving yeah
supposed benefit
cuz got really big couple
month ago got huge
movement polar
people like identify raw milk
antiestablishment statement almost
proposed thing like got
undenatured protein enzyme
live bacteria okay
mechanistically think help
health havent seen evidence
support actual benefit
truly beneficial somebody
came yeah
assume true right know
guy
okay moving gmo food bad
health
health concern
eating genetically modified food
fact there modified gene
leading modified protein
digest like
protein dna food
eat though sort second
level effect bad
eating modified corn whatever
right im expert
part environmental
impact monoculture
company control
seed used make
particular product uh different
pesticide use specific
modified thing
separate question eat
modified soy corn going
directly harm health part
answer clearly right
youre saying
separate argument make
gmos one talk
whether harmful
physiologically right right
there quite lot know
decade research large
population showing there health
risk eating modified version
way arent isnt
arent crop monocrops yeah
mean whether gmo mean
isnt dont know answer
know like corn soy stuff
think like 90 plus gmo right
okay youre eating cornbased
product um maybe there something
said process gmo
make corn available diet
meaningfully shift overall
food profile eating maybe
shift impact dietary
intake overall culture true
nothing corn
versus unmodified corn right
way dont know youve ever
seen heirloom corn screw crap
okay like corn thats modified
juicy delicious yeah sweet
everything like pink
purple blue shriveled little
thing know call corn
yeah yeah yeah
think there little food sold
supermarket
match ungenetically modified
ancestor ancestor right absolutely
laboratory
gmo itd farmer farmer gmo right
point selected
century yeah dont people
say label food
gmo thats surely
necessary would say
label gmo one branch
say scientist gmo
farmer gmo right every food
item would gmo would gmo
kind anytime make hybrid
crossbreed anything like
youre genetically modifying plant
carrot isnt carrot
originally purple yeah
way love purple carrot yeah
go right moving um
fluoride water type
broader public health initiative
take away going
harm everyone equally assuming
benefit interesting who going
deeply impact people
least access dental care
least access fluoridated
toothpaste regular toothbrushing
right there large chunk society
possibly wouldnt see much
big health impact compared another
section society may see massive
disproportion dialogue thats never
discussed nobody ever talk
right right yeah certainly
happen privileged
stance cant decide based
broad public health
met shouldnt certainly
people often yeah following
sort comment clever
red flag
content might misinformed
get ear pricricked go
oh hello good stuff lot
strong overlap type
content intriguing
watch youll see anecdote
presented three friend
latest stage cancer right
took xyz medication none
cancer mhm
hydroxychloricquin okay yeah wasnt
going name medication isnt
different
podcast frequently done
anecdote presented place
evidence immediate red flag
also really think
evidence think evidence
present there saying
plural anecdote data
nice need tshirt
yes scientist even even
slogan boring
plural anecdote data
beautiful say wish
people got though yeah
replacement controlled
clinical study youre monitoring
different variable
otherwise easily confound whatever
youre looking right
tell people say oh
aunt took herbal cure
cancer shes fine right
say nine people
took cure dead
interviewed anybody
much get put
social medium behind conflict
interest thats major red flag
see somebody telling oh
autoimmune disease cancer
heart disease due
deficiency three vitamin
go link bio
happen selling vial
90 per month really trust
broad statement first
making broad statement like
there reason people see
individual nutritionist dietitian
doctor cant give
prescriptive advice like take
vitamin solve
autoimmune disease thats simply
true youre selling vitamin
capsule youre motivated make
type statement okay thats
thats another red flag however
theyre selling
doesnt mean doesnt work correct
would mean want
little cautious right
right immediate
disqualifying event exactly
would start place skepticism
start see oh
there conflict interest theyre
presenting anecdote theyre
sensationalized exaggerating
theyre claiming one
particular treatment helping
five different disease theyre
really charismatic theyre really
charismatic uh guardrail
almost roof wow okay
thats universal cure
tablet potion lotion yeah
somebody selling something
say youve got autoimmune disease
heart disease cancer youre
feeling depressed maybe need
thing cost 100 isnt
dude sell
elixir tonic tonic
back wagon snake
oil snake oil yeah exactly
thing internet
today working principle
audience still
human vulnerable
susceptible human yeah thats
exactly youre feeling
vulnerable youre feeling like
ive doctor told
dont know exactly whats going
person say maybe
theyve got thing sell
maybe itll work werent
feeling vulnerable moment
might easily identify oh
theyre grifting theyre trying
make buck theyre looking
desperate last refuge
desperate find yes mhm
right right one
false dichotoies polarized thinking
yeah another example
thing perform super well social
medium say dont eat
totally plantbased totally
carnivore diet youre risk
different disease reality
like obviously eat
whole plantbased food
vegetable nut legume
whole grain thats better
health like cant
occasionally nonplantbased
food spectrum
type content thats always going
perform really well make
really big bold sensational
claim arent necessarily
reflective scientific reality
one know evidence
theyre making extraordinary
claim yeah thats evidence thats
thats one thing
thats ticking box content
theyre making super exaggerated
claim wow like
toolkit like checklist
checklist send around believe
medical misinformation known
misinformation people
pedalling actually think
real think
real someone else know
misinformation person who
delivering becomes misinformation
know false
still share becomes
disinformation okay think there
think lot time people
genuinely believe thing theyre
saying even theyre selling
product fix deficiency
whatever theyre
sometimes may theyre
always knowingly deceiving
lot time think people
believe thing theyre
pedalling boost
sincerity camera right right
dont think otherwise
cant sit front camera lie
people year knowingly
extracting money people
people dont think could
well think people
psychologically convince
lie first
believe lie
happen theyre able
promulgate lie convincingly
actually believe yeah
recently wasnt sure
biggest sort peddler
disinformation questionable
supplement really believe
talking watched crazy
video joe marcola um one
largest sort supplement salesman
pusher misinformation investigative
reporting showing consults
belief entity causal
plane get zoom session
sort seer person relaying
message plane
existence astonishing show
know truly belief
person channeling entity
guiding business practice
type information he going
one top 10 supplier like
medical institution world
stunning see video zoom
session realize he making
mansion try
sell people supplement
there something deeper going
right disinformation misinformation
one thing angle
bring antiscience way
cant dont like science
let move must strategy
must way messaging
pushed delivered
way
antiscience also well dont
trust scientist know
urge say well trust im
expert anyone say
trust
someone else right someone
exact credential right phd
doctor time make statement
totally incorrect many
pedigree school
attended awarded
yeah think
comment trust huge one
people think fda
nih cdc there probably
face come mind thats
oppos maybe one person even
one person dont know
person like free
time dont know
family enjoy thats
opposite happens social
medium develop deep like
personal relationship almost
people see whether theyre
pushing misinformation evidencebased
information think take
human connection actually build
trust whatever someone saying
mhm wait youre saying
people pedling misinformation
developing relationship
viewer viewer trust
absolutely yeah okay hows
trust going tik tok channel
yeah aside medical information
video guy get lot hater
like youre full know
sometimes there working big
pharma get hater hater
hater going hate happens know
big enough viewership get
manner comment part
making like im going tell
ibuprofen today know
make video dog ill
little silly dancing video trend
something show
real person youre paritting
data research paper
lab coat yeah yeah fact
memorable dm ive ever received
back 2021 everyone question
covid vaccine
talking 99 live
stream come end
say ive got go wife
almost home hospital ive got
go cook dinner end
live stream cool
comment message
got afterwards didnt know
believed co vaccine
dont know trust dont
know trust science
said reason leaving
go cook dinner wife
realized like youre normal
person right right
best strategy viewer want
know rather absorb information
someone entertaining
personable may right
source go
research done
research neils talked youve
got confirmation bias
sort navigate
getting right right information
right especially since phd
many year take phd
four half four nearly five
year focusing one topic right
right year journal paper
published people
spend half hour afternoon
saying research
research yeah could
listening podcast right could
watching youtube video
short answer realistically think
people cant research
way would interpret
one research topic
youre fact half graduate
school learning graduate
student right really complex
find relevant research
paper critically interpret
study design result
context broader literature
youre talking hundred hour
time spent reading given topic
area one going
certainly watching
instagram video questioning
medically accurate
youre left unfortunately
identify people
institution trust going
say trusted source really
key youre never going go
research required every given
medical topic topic know
general life
institution need make
accessible face fact
science seems
weaponized turned
yeah think there critical
shortcoming people
tune 4hour discussion section
cdc talk benefit
risk vaccine
intervention would quickly
realize people taking
rigorous approach medical
risk benefit trust
come right answer never
see even though
technically publicly available
focus focus
communicating sort inner
detail decision made
end decision
recommendation recommendation
good reason perhaps
doctor take make
recommendation known think thing
shifted even since co
think would really benefit
personalization big
institution way people feel
know people okay im old
enough remember would mid80s
early 80 surgeon general
cfford coupe came said got
wear condom
prevent spread aid dont
think anyone publicly said word
condom right uh especially
public official people trusted
plus little sex
education school
yeah plus certain
grandpa element face
nation medicine right fouchi
maybe really
solution think think
thats big part really
humanizing process come
recommendation first
place trust
recommendation know
process youve gone people
never going sit 300 hour
worth research topic someone
phd pharmarmacology
mention immunology explain actual
science vaccine work
body go create necessary
antibody actually
process youre infected
virus right
answer ill answer
vaccine standpoint get
injection arm right
injected often little
piece pathogen happens
arm tissue pretty much nothing
right youve got one big immune
cell come scoop
take draining lymph node
called go
whole separate pathway
body youve got blood circulatory
system people dont know
actually separate almost
circulation system called lymph
lymphatic system white blood
cell travel wherever got
injection carry back lymph
node start showing
immune cell say
recognize recognize
find one oh
like lineup
neat part cell
sitting lymph node waiting
shown something recognize
theyll sit like
exactly like guy car
airport dont recognize
nothing happens
one lymph node
like take time okay
exactly immune cell getting tired
walking along
cell randomly
generated advance right
co ever existed body
cell b cell recognized covid
eventually got
infected first time got
vaccine like time
shine basically like oh hey know
one happens cell
get activated multiplies
multiplies multiplies start making
antibody right go back
site infection go throughout
whole body also activates tec
cell cell one
recognize oh friendly cell
infected virus better kill
cell kill cell
right right exactly get
combination antibody
floating around neutralize virus
cell tc cell
kill one incubating
virus actively process
happens whether youve infected
virus still take piece
virus go lymph node
activates bnt cell here
something never understood uh
people pretty serious side
effect covid vaccine uh
vaccine co would
done mean would
side effect
gotten co straight dont
think dont know data say
one way severity
vaccine response predictive
know data one way guy honest
honest boring thats
cope want
call scientist
speaking theyre honest
work people say dont
know one way another thats honesty
id rather right yeah could
lie u really confident
say yeah man
got bad fever injection
would died co
uh dont know one way
suspicion there probably
much link two
also would hard test
obviously
vaccinated get infected
going way
infection get going
lessened fact youve
vaccinated right yeah uh
like trying get toothpaste back
tube yeah yeah happening
let talk less extreme
misunderstanding vaccine
starting many
vaccination hm short answer
come point
keep vaccinating certain
pathogen dont get additional
benefit there actually really big
result published hpv vaccine
one dose versus two dos human
papilloma virus thats right one
cause cervical cancer going
one dose two dos much
better one dose important
know right critically
trial reveal
otherwise wouldnt know yeah
result decade
clinical study maybe question
though general like people talk
oh child going receive x
number vaccine number
year one answer
definitely consider total
number pathogen exposed
daily basis think entire
gut constantly sampled
bacteria virus everything
immune system secretting
antibody gut regulate
gut microbiome additional one
10 pathogen vaccine drop
bucket compared compared
everything thats happening inside
body time way
cannot emphasize enough
comparison gave common
science say harm
right yeah look
thing youre
youre worried harming
risk 10 time
high right harm thats
important comparison make
statistical comparison
dont think people comfortable
experience yeah well
way intuit
intuition f false intuit
wrongly say well
took vaccine vaccine
vaccine vaccine
time body must able
handle causing
disease condition
truth body responding
responding
time yeah separately
parallel go back fact
there cell sitting
lift node waiting target
right activate
one one still available
waiting target
activate time
time theyre theyre
different thing theyre theyre
fighting different thing like
one stepping right
know theyre going like
five alarm fire one fire station
called second fire station
called dont cancel
help
thing know one take one part
house one take another yeah
right couple less extreme
misunderstanding go uh
firstly overload immune system
boost immune system oh
great question thats wow
cannot boost immune system
way youre thinking think
would good idea boost
immune system want balance
immune system actually get
much immune activity know
end autoimmune disease right
get little immune activity
body increase risk
cancer right balance
enough immune
activity respond acute infection
stuff even could boost
immunity taking supplement
dont know would want
right um certainly
funny start life
thats whole idea keep
child away let go
whatever theyre going
encounter pathogen naturally
theyre going body
immune system going develop
accordingly yeah say
thing reduce
function immune system
dont want getting enough
sleep right say way
get
high quality high double negative
thing yeah confusing get
proper sleep sleep nutrition physical
activity right low stress time
thing boring
meaningfully impact immune
response sleep deprive someone
giving vaccine
measure difference tighters
theyre going develop like
day leading vaccine
theyre going
develop uh like antibbody
response vaccine worse
youve sleep deprived
day leading look
basic lifestyle stuff like
experiment someone conducted
yeah
volunteered exactly
youre every year took
vaccine got yeah youre
sort basic lifestyle stuff
know already every
disease planet um thats
basically extent want
caring immune system
also going help
everything else go
bring next guest
vaccine need boosted later
whereas whereas others dont great
question word
immune vaccinated
life one kind another one
need need measles like
right yeah got measel
shot child back 60 youre
probably going need booster right
there two level variability
one across different pathogen
mhm pathogen capsular
harder get longerlasting
know antibbody response
need get response
need get boosted
infection get maybe
get infection recurrently
rhino virus different corona
virus like get infected
life never get
pathogen right time
maybe immunity waines whatever
reason there difference across
pathogen based structure
oh there also big difference
say structure mean
physical molecule would ever
connect yeah prime
memory immune response either
longerlasting interesting
there also huge difference
across people variability
potency immune response
duration last okay
cant tell based feel
there two level
variability population
work great given person
given pathogen could see hugely
different persisting antibbody level 20
30 year vaccination heard
saying medicine good
anyone tested
everyone wow yeah there
truth right absolutely
cant test everyone
sample size test
thousand people there
one million reaction someone
might wont know
sample thousand right
whole value post
marketing surveillance uh
done surprisingly word
surveillance come please best post
followup post marketing followup yes
youve got database looking
signal potential risk
one pop know thats
probably anecdotal serf
basis rigorous investigation
go afterwards got
tell end
tell vaccine
adverse event reporting system adverse
effect reporting system
yeah
exactly type monitoring system
weve tested vaccine
number people look good
number people going
test 300 million people
release release
youre getting safety signal
thing start pop time
say well go formal
study look thats actually
associated vaccine give
excuse focus right thing
could rare would
never see typical clin clinical
trial even 10000 20000
people clinical study
one million one 10
million right there
noise thing
voluntarily reported sometimes
thing happen coincidence thats
v stand volunteer look
v stand vaccine
yeah vaccine adverse event reporting
system relies entirely
someone knowing exists logging
typing effect right
adverse effect often healthcare
provider log theyll say
person got vaccine oh good
there professional loop
correct good know um
system doesnt
mean necessarily related
starting point investigation
thats go wrong people
say look many report
system course
happens vaccinate 30 million
child child
going thing happen
unrelated might related
may there rare
thing time coincident
there cause effect right
critical identify
true signal cant
rely show vaccine
dangerous xyz right yes
interesting tell im wrong
covid
vaccine arrived wasnt yet enough
everybody first
responder teacher think
roll felt sensible
u remembered thing like
