im sort materialist like
think consciousness
biological property arose
evolution ask well
consciousness u
might rest biology
cant tell much time ive
spent contemplating fact every
morning wake there 8
billion people world
persistently possibility
fact youre youre overestimating
extent remain day
day oh youre neil youre
man need explanation
music
sentence star talk special
edition hear know
two cohosts gary oreilly gary
nice neil good back former soccer
pro sport commentator sporting new
part
head alerted yeah like neural chip
yeah thats surgical scar
installed brain yeah
looking something
complete waste time gota
course got chuck nice comedian actor
long time star talk cohost absolutely
always good gary
cook topic well
little group think
producer production team
land whole load different
variety ongoing
thought process uh consciousness
spoke david chas
going get another thought
process consciousness
hard problem consciousness
like threebody problem
unsolvable even exist
transhuman future youre thinking
future mind totally
able upload
consciousness exist forever
feel eventually
travel deep space going
come across alien life form
super intelligent artificial
intelligence going find
biological life form um there lot
people think future ai
exist ai thats
discussion going get
guest today guest alel
seth professor cognitive
computational neuroscience
university sussex england place
know reasonably well speaks
language yes
pay attention um phd computer
science artificial intelligence
writer author whose recent book
published 2021 neil
please delight anil
anil anil say right thats
exactly right thank much
pleasure
show excellent excellent
topic know everyone cant shake
stick without land somewhere
somebody deeply thinking
consciousness everybody think
theyve got answer leaf
ask pretty basic question
using prove
consciousness even exists
thing could even possibly
uploaded computer one day oh well
there lot question within
question mean people dont even
agree mean there
philosopher might call
illusionist think
consciousness doesnt really exist
sense ask
anyone street might might assume
mistaken
there anything special
thing call conscious experience
think think theyre wrong
frankly mean many thing
consciousness cant sure whether
right wrong think
thing really
sure conscious experience
everything else kind inferred
whether world around
u self everything else know
science sort know
point experience
something uh
explain consciousness think
real there difference
awake aware
completely general anesthesia
think u would agree
thing world conscious
least time
people animal
thing like table chair
object
thing there great deal
uncertainty like um animal
insect people brain damage
course know hot topic today
artificial intelligence extent
define consciousness
way ai exhibit
property would
concede ai conscious
finding every time ai hit
another threshold another goalpost
people move goalpost
make
sense doesnt make
sense going say make
sense closer ai get
truly conscious sentient
become less special
got keep moving post
right raise bar
maintain supposed
preeminence anal much
definition consciousness
feel
special well think qu thats
profound point driven
lot confusion relationship
mean youll notice neil
astrophysicist right mean
thought special led
people longest time think
center universe
plus kind looked
way fairness standing earth
whole universe revolved around u
wasnt completely conflict
evidence thats
true course darwin
something similar nature
creature pointing also
special sense
created god different way
related
animal yeah sense
consciousness last refuge
human
exceptionalism beautiful
sentence feel human
consciousness somehow really special
set u apart uh know dayart
made explicit called
nonhuman animal uh beast machine
bit machine french um trying
make point nonhuman
animal flesh blood
mechanism robot made living
material didnt kind
least didnt kind
consciousness mattered
moral consideration
trat record weve kind got around
way longer
think center
universe longer think
unrelated creature
u think there wide
consensus
conscious creature ask
cat ask cat yeah could
ask cat ask cat
wont answer youve left
room theory
consciousness know ive seen
lot ism right dualism
monism materialism way
try get mysterious place
mind theyre way
thinking problem sort
thing come theory
theyre philosophical theory
consciousness seems
incredibly mysterious thing
one hand physical creature
made stuff complicated
stuff stuff seems
stuff anyway hand
conscious experience intuitively
seem physical world
different world
conscious experience
explanation term physic
chemistry tell
anything anyone conscious
david charmer called hard
problem consciousness know he
show um
idea theyre totally unrelatable
dualism operate separate
realm youve got whole bunch
ism theyre really
theory theyre sort perspective
might take might
build theory let interject
someone come
say uh dr tyson theory
say einstein
hypothesis clear
physical science theory fully
tested explanation phenomenon
make successful prediction dont know
thats getting semantic
word theory many people say oh
theory without recognizing
least physical science
theory highest form
understanding think thats
right think theory goal isnt
well tested empirically well
established explanatorily powerful
theory thats goal would
say consciousness
proto theory beginning
theory ambitious
others none reached
level maturity weve seen
physic relativity quantum
mechanic thing
mean still theory
make prediction explain
observation know happens
one amazing thing
consciousness philosophically
seems incredibly mysterious
amazing advantage brain
relatively numerous relatively
accessible know compared
big bang small world
quantum mechanic look
inside living human brain people
gain consciousness lose consciousness
change consciousness
study sense much easily
frontier
mystery thats great
begin use evidence
constrain improve theory
talk
mystery um consciousness broken
different kind type segment
one big thing prefer
kind divide conquer approach
actually uh treat
one big scary mystery need one
massive eureka solution
resistant resistant
even sense would
satisfying answer look like know
would content
term explanation
area science kind divide
conquer approach paid dividend
good parallel think
history life
reductionism yeah let add something
early day physic
branch physic philosopher
played important role help
shape question help direction
thing evidence
field still infancy
philosopher sort running among
look like philosopher
every turn youre trying
arrive conclusion
point
evidencebased longer
philosopher armchair useful
answer
coming lab
brain think philosopher
long game consciousness
one thing ive seen
last 30 year ive
stuff dialogue
philosophy science become
richer certain thing may
started purely philosophical
become know realm lab
thats great thats thing
would lab
philosopher little less useful
thats im saying
answer coming lab think
point right certainly point
right philosophy
still extremely useful
still bit confused
question ask
interpret answer theory
coming still quite
philosophical flavor also
implication hugely important
remain philosophical like yes
understanding
happens brain someone loses
consciousness
understanding
understanding consciousness
term treat animal
treat um brain injured human
indeed ai always
going right last
bit said
difference function
something function like
consciousness feel cuz let
honest true knowing
yeah know consciousness
individual like visceral
intense knowing cannot
ascribe something else
say conscious yet
thing function consciousness
like tree root network allows
tree literally talk one another
need water tree get
water know uh need
fight particular fungi like
kind knowing wont
say theyre conscious well say
thats function find
balance difference make
differentiation yeah really
tricky um tight rope walk
know one hand use
human way kind
benchmark know
conscious thats thats starting
point like dont want
anthropocentric see everything
human lens
every function going need
consciousness im sort materialist
like think consciousness
biological property arose
evolution gradually um perform
certain function enable certain
function creature
useful
ask well consciousness
u might rest
biology there lot
different answer
consciousness u seems bring
ton information together kind
unified way said know
know sense knowing
seems kind thing
open eye morning
there whole unified world
experience everything going
around alarm clock smell
coffee whatever experience
body experience know
might next cant tell
much time ive spent contemplating
fact every morning wake
someone else thats
youre quantum
leap okay right im wrong
show youre wrong show buddy yeah
get well would
would expect someone else
woke expect
wonder im
matter expectation there 8
billion people world
persistently
make every day wake
possibility fact
youre youre overestimating extent
remain day day
know like think
youre youre neil
youre man need
explanation sentence
think neil de eison age
10 something know really
person well memory
age memory
experience alter u
like microscopically point
decade later arent quite
person get
memory event occurred
well think actually
often recall something
less accurate memory thats
say work hard avoid
wear memory
youre saying experience
differently remember
remember
experience differently
remember every time cell
make copy know
best
cell might slightly different
might slightly better could
better cell could slightly
worse say two primary
failure memory one
remember thing never happened
one dont remember
thing dont claim
remember everything life
remember remember pretty
high precision forgot third
remember black man
police lineup
yeah want gary
said he absolutely right
thing there there
phenomenon perception called change
blindness one way change blindness
happen something change
slowly dont perceive change
perception change dont
experience change perception
something like might well
happening self u
experience self changing
little bit day day
change slowly never experience
changing
compare like oh
like 10 year ago 20 year im
actually may quite different okay
therapist paid lot money
speed
process well think mean
certainly thats one way
think certainly bring
aspect forgotten point
different different
well else go
therapist unless there something
want change thats right
potential change think speed
may best term
know certainly want reveal
thing
know longer
take better
billing cycle thats im
saying yeah anil chuck
saying tree kind roll
referring melium
network fungal network yeah
taking fact roll
table say
psychism thats basically ill ill
basic thats
there
consciousness inferred everything
uh sake please
ive heard term
psychism ive even looked
still dont get whole concept
consciousness derived
everything consciousness inferred
upon everything
something im
heard word ive never looked
sound kind new agy
thats want get get
official yeah stand
well im
fan wellestablished
philosophical position
consciousness inferred
everywhere fundamental
something equivalent status mass
energy electrical charge
fundamental aspect universe
live saying
table conscious tree
conscious consciousness exists
fundamental level thing
certain thing like human
being exhibit consciousness
level whole organism
table wouldnt table made
thing individually little
bit conscious there
consciousness inheres table
think mean thats
doesnt really help okay
said chuck could
read explanation still know
hell
mean thats best
explanation word need
work well anel said wasnt
big fan anyway he probably going
want throw bus whats
whats wrong mean
consciousness fundamental
everywhere thats reasonable isnt
yeah long im conscious
reasonable dont know everywhere
mean guess thats big question
know way mass
basically pretty much everywhere
electrical charge pretty much
everywhere thing
dont lower lower level
wa consciousness moon
mean im trying understand
universe large life
earth pan psychism trying
declare consciousness permeates
universe basically
yes yeah mean thats way
could look said
anil kind um
connective pressure force
acting upon u whether youre
aware table
aware force part
force maybe
allows u interact table
consciousness reading
rupert sheldrake fan
memory serf correct know
im entirely sure long
8 hour train journey
ruper sheld last year
clear he certainly
view thats british train system
norway
um britain would 24 hour
um yeah go certainly he
view everything
consciousness everywhere life
life consciousness closely
tight kind agree
there intimate connection
life consciousness probably would
put slightly different way
everything alive
consciousness certainly think
alive critical
conscious neil ive read
people want think consciousness
extending beyond self shared sort
consciousness field im
im always one fun idea fun new
ide universe work
physical science put
high currency testability idea
whether sound good
audience people testing
pan psychism way would give
teeth role
skeptical yeah well pan
psychism cant tested thats
one one problem
problem philosophical position
way thinking
consciousness fit
universe idea
consciousness sort
extend beyond body
something interacts
thing know kind field
go beyond brain
tested mean people tried
test sort thing time
extra sensory perception telepathy
sort thing none
stood theyve
tested rigorously face hard
evidence anil uh
casual review literature tell
decade every animal
used think thinking
anything demonstrated level
intelligence competence
beyond originally ascribed
longer really call
someone bird brain see
great feat thought
problem solving bird uh
performed
today list people keep
animal yeah theyre conscious
cross say
theyre conscious
fuzzy boundary going one day
move entirely full animal
kingdom think think fuzzy
boundary certainly fuzzy boundary
term people think uh
may also fuzzy boundary reality
know may creature
really unclear whether
theyre conscious might
gradual thing fade fade
day think
consensus human
primate
mammal think certainly think
neuroscientist think would
agree except delicious one
delicious one conscious
people nothing fear
delicious animal conscious
thank chuck
world according ch yeah
beyond beyond mammal look
mammal kind
basic brain structure process
turn important human
consciousness according
theory
go beyond mammal thing
get tricky thing really get tricky
dont want assume
kind consciousness present let say
bumblebee need humanlike
order valid even mamalian
like right cant look wouldnt
say language useful criterion
fact bumblebee cant speak u
there reason think
conscious um say
speaking bee well bee
speak bee well
speak tre thing speaking
thing communicating
way thats thats widespread
would say like right people
uncertain including
kind level insect
including bee fish many
different kind fish fish
conscious seem
different look
instance whether fish seek
anesthetic proactive way
theyve got know little little
injury thing
suggestive experience pain
cant know sure make
best guess best guess
always going shift always
going walk line
using human benchmark
sort assuming everything
conscious know
responds environment grows
something else could
done way doesnt require
consciousness there
different category conscious
like said maybe
experienced category category
yeah
consciousness know mean remember
growing told human
biggest brain realized
dont biggest brain
take ratio mass
human mass brain
top list
okay didnt tell u
mouse dog come close u
ratio didnt really say
also didnt say
top list
barely mammal bring
animal animal
higher brain body weight
ratio like midsized bird like crow
sort thing um higher
brain body weight ratio
highest brain body weight ratio
certain specie ant weve seen
giant head relative
body much brain
organism calculus still doesnt
leave u top brain
give u consciousness im perfectly
happy say ant conscious yes
smart keep trying
move rubber tree let
honest mean people keep trying
find way still put
human top every pile every
list make might brain
body ratio anymore itll
something complexity
connectivity brain
look oh maybe put u back
top see degree
know brain front
brain frontal matter
something like therell always
way im saying
there nothing special distinctive
human brain human intelligence
human consciousness think think
clearly mean kind
language something
dont see specie
isnt isnt one thing
always going fall back
language animal community
communicates various way
take speech take
hearing take sight
still find way communicate
one another animal
think there something
right think language
present specie
look find
right look harder find
find way whale wonder
whether face
make sound wonder
actually
communicating say
anil point
weve blurred line
intelligence consciousness im glad
mentioned
background far think
confusion conflation two
concept lead u astray intelligence
something think
distinctively human certainly
see like put top
intelligence tree take
intelligence proxy
consciousness look nonhuman
animal tend think well theyre
smart theyre likely
conscious actually theyre
different concept imagine
organism animal conscious
without particularly smart
basic widespread conscious
state might thing like feeling
suffering pain pl
dont highly
intelligent specie kind
experience useful
hand come
back ai situation may
way intelligent
dont involve require consciousness
one ever asked whether ai
feel pain yes many
people youve asked chat gpt
kind question course
chat gpt say
tell well depends
prompt one
know couple year ago
engineer google guy called
blake le moy think
chatbot called lambda wasnt nearly
good chat language model
dialogue
whether conscious
persuaded day
similar dialogue one
he guy got fired he guy
got guy got fired saying
got fired saying doesnt mean
wrong think wrong
know got fired breaching
confidential ity cause big fuori
right know language model
actually conscious
ask appear think
deeply question
come plausible answer
especially ask talk
consciousness one listening
know really think
really inner life theyll
say yes course exactly
language model supposed
know theyre trained enormous
amount text give
statistical association generate
plausible answer like think
tendency think language
model conscious reflection
human bias cant
imagine system speaking u unless
conscious rather insight
whether system actually
conscious explain
work neil neil well
neil sorry neils chat
gp4 p touring test thats
exactly point simply equal
consciousness thats exactly
point wait wait id like think
theyve passed touring test ever
since eliza back 1960s okay whatever
anyone defined touring test
time pass say oh
well maybe move
move goal post
brought large language
model back time even
primitive back time
would said pas touring test
need goalpost move
need goalpost
sense need multitude test
cross reference
say show
hasnt thats exactly
right touring test way
like think test
human gullibility rather machine
intelligence either still
touring test right think
whatever would yeah alan turing
mind handily satisfied
people anyone idea
computer could say yep im
talking there human
side machine alan touring
easily
catfished explicitly test
whether machine think
test machine intelligence
stated test machine
consciousness there beautiful
di
film youve seen film x
mackina alex gallens film um wonderful
there scene
think invent called nathan
program called caleb
theyre speaking nathan asked
caleb say touring test
say test machine intelligence
dialogue go well youve
created machine consciousness thats
act god something like he
slipped intelligence
consciousness need kind
touring test consciousness
touring test intelligence think
think youre right need need
multitude test thats
blurring line
intelligence consciousness yeah
mean sense theyre related
right intelligent allows u
different kind conscious
experience like ability feel
regret rather sadness relies
enough intelligence imagine
alternative action alternative
outcome thing equal
might related different
thing gpt whatever really
convinces u intelligent
still sufficient evidence
conscious neil communicate
executing large language
model head im using
lookup table yeah right im there
there word head ive used
im likely compose one
sentence certain variety versus
another
probability word follow
word speak maybe im ai
maybe im chat
gp5 think youre much
much interesting rich gpc5
know well think
there many many difference
mean there similarity right
extent lot
thing ai based neural network
wonderful see
um jeff hinton john hopfield win
nobel prize physic work
machine learning course lot
based neural network
neural network inspired
level whats happening inside
biological brain like there ton
difference language model
around u trained
basically entire corpus
everything thats ever written
mean theyre trained whole
available searcha postable posted
theyre trained ton data
right dont need learn
speak much less data
thing language model cannot
whatever
thing even though
might
similarity good point
future store u
going whats next
upload consciousness
jar live forever dont open
jar
great great grandfather
kill
laughter
meanwhile dont think
upload cloud
worry whole way thinking
think latest
manifestation kind tech bro
hubristic singularity nonsense
dont really need
somewhere line anil artificial
intelligence
consciousness
david charmer seems think
coming year time weve
got silicon intelligence
familiar
synthetic biological intelligence
biological
intelligence disposed sort
following human thing
consciousness dont think personally
bit david chas
conversation think
disagree bit
personally dont think
ai made silicon likely
conscious think might
persuasive u think
there good reason think
wont doesnt mean
impossible build synthetic
consciousness question
similar biological
consciousness made
stuff
made neuron carbon could
another material think
open question think artificial
consciousness much likely
arise circuit
future language model
laboratory building thing
like organoids brain organoids
made stuff
brain organoids theyre made
actual neuron human neuron many
case derived stem cell
like whole level uncertainty
go window made
stuff dont worry
whether stuff matter
whether consciousness something
computer could reason
get less worked
know least far
organoids dont really anything
interesting sit
dish dont dont think
theyre conscious know
psychological bias
exercise way get
complicated start
stuff think thats
real ethical worry come
physicist
ultimately distinguish neuron
firing
electrochemically silicon firing
electro care care
made matter
electrochemical signal
distinction people making feel
needlessly artificial mean
know physicist there big
difference whats happening
silicon chip whats happening
brain agree
wouldnt principle
im saying get full
electrochemical mapping brain
created silicon ive
duplicated brain im
without carbon im using care
care okay there there reason
care there reason care
youve helped
kind thought experiment
youve said well
principle could done like
could duplicate everything thats
going brain silicon
actually know may possible
instance take golden
gate bridge try make
cheese youre going
able know bridge
made certain material
certain physical property
stuff inside brain certain
physical property silicon doesnt
um think matter
neuron
exchange spike action potential
know digital way might
think well okay weve abstracted away
messy fine detail biology
silicon fine
there actually much going
brain digital
exchange spike stuff
matter like thing like electrical
field neurotransmitter
stuff chemical washing around
thing know
cant even principle replicate
silicon well would say
yet wouldnt preclude
thats know like
look look thing mechanically
brain happens complex
example thing organ
joint replace
knee hip know replace
thing functioning
body another era would
said oh human body unreplaceable
got know million year
evolution perfect
get rid youve got cartilage
missing right
confidence power physic
equation could
matter big tool
move around molecule configuration
might need want
allow engineering level well
course duplicate
brain might still
able make yeah silicon chip
might made
kind building block order
kind functional
property like level
biological right biological
there another way put
think perhaps intuitive like
computer power computer
designed kind thing
completely easily
separate
made
different thats know
software run computer
run somebody elses thats actually
special rare property
dont find nature general
brain kind thing
separate
wind
bit surely
know ray kur updated version
book singularity near
guess new title called well
nerra n golden gate bridge
made cheese
theo gd uh called singularity
nearer oh wow many focus group
go anil
take u
notion brain machine
interface reach singularity point
future history
civilization different
competitive specie
top every table
going make shortcut put
something head
keep consciousness super
intelligent barking
wrong tree mean
whole idea singularity find
suspicious right
based idea thing
getting exponentially better faster
bigger one thing know
human psychology
absolutely terrible uh
understanding um nature
exponential change terrible
pandemic
linear
people stand
exponential everything behind look
completely flat everything front
look incredibly steep
wherever curve
hard judge
whats happening find
intuition get get really unreliable
start thinking kind
thing may sort
escape velocity reach
threshold thing become
different likely
happen necessarily ai
longevity research know might
come time people know enough
passing year theyre able
extend lifespan
year effectively never die
people talk find
thats also pretty dystopian frankly
might another threshold indeed
possible artificial
intelligence becomes smarter u
way already smarter u
way
think see wrong
way think term
sort race u
machine one mentor
philosopher daniel dennett think
put best um sadly died earlier
year one thing said
always remember
come ai always remember
creating tool
colleague mindful
difference technology
create compliment particular
human intelligence less
preoccupied trying replace
upload
thing actually dig
slightly unsavory
motivation know living
forever bootstrapping oneself top
societal pyramid
kind thing think
old story weve seen many time
course daniel first
box declare one early
book called conscious
explained title one
book felt like already
here book book need
published subject
1991 like 30 year
ago yeah remember reading
first year undergraduate actually
think even earlier
read 1991 anil likely
enter postbiological
age come know
mean total total exist
specie go got end
answer make make good
answer thats going
last thing people
pressure well short answer
dont dont think think
likely always going
fundamentally biological though
become cyborg know
already intertwined
technology level
dependency get deeper deeper
brain machine interface coming
exploration cyborgian suv
siiz rover mar right
bidding uh search
discovery testing imagery
answer question
matter ask make alien
contact biological
form machine
version either robotic
neary
actual uh uploaded consciousness
physical form doesnt
survive hostile journey space
travel robot meeting
robot yeah thats mo thought
likely thing would
sort uninteresting goo
likely encounter encounter
alien
life encounter intelligent
life agree agree chuck
think likely robot
avatar rather biological creature
well movie 1958 called blob
would classify goo
would come said
goo careful think
concept goo
equal good point thank
cant believe came
show thinking thats definite thing
ive got say
remember show
created equal neil
show went got darker darker
darker evidence youre
different time zone
youre hailing part
england im brighton south
coast pretty dark
brighton sun setting
u dare say evidence
live round earth okay
anil great show maybe
come back
development future mine
right chuck good always
pleasure right gary pleasure neil
thank made happen neil
degrass tyson youre personal
astrophysicist keep looking
music
