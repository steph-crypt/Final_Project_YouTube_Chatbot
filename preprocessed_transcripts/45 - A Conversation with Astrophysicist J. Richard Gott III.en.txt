colonist star talk neil degrass
tyson personal astrophysicist
today featuring exclusive
oneonone conversation longtime
friend colleague fellow
astrophysicist j richard got
iii deep thinker manner
subject sun moon
star rich
got hi neil think think thats
best compliment ever got best
compliment thats best uh
rich gott youre youre close friend
youre probably closest colleague
friend oh spent lot
time together together conversation
dining family
probably met earlier didnt
become close friend princeton
university postdoc many
moon ago spent almost
whole life faculty princeton
university let put
professional background
table uh born raised kentucky
right high school win
science fair thing place
west inh house science talent serch
thats big one thats big one
called called
regenon regeneron
regeneron first place math
uh uh national science fair
international got trip japan
come second place westing house
get meet president
yes met president johnson
far ago
johnson johnson
asked head judge
contest 14 year later who
famous person judged uh thatd
natalie portman natalie portman yes
remember paper
science talent search yes
top 300 okay doesnt know
also top 120 saw
paper liked okay thats
remembered especially liked even
famous idea
right paper judged
entirely scientific merit mhm
idea
enzyme digest waste paper make
hydrogen fuel really like project
okay movie thor play
scientist play play
astrophysicist someone thought tap
applause
okay go college
youre graduating class
al gore yeah like farest gump every
place turn there famous thing
spawn moment
youve life time uh people
said well father senator
know people said man he maybe
president one day know uh
watch someone come
bottom long way um
extraordinarily well there
lot people think might become
president never get remembered
thats thats torturous way
rather getting result
end looking back thats right uh
tommy lee jones also class
class okay theyre saying
youre class oh thatd
nice thats good okay college
went graduate school princeton
prince got phd went
caltech ran away little bit
went uh cambridge university
cambridge england came
back joined faculty youve
ever since
ever since im delighted
likewise
first appeared
princeton said somebody
got get
know friend co
taught class yes wrote
textbook third three
teners someone called u michael
stra michael strauss right
book book welcome
universe highly readable
textbook course taught right
look dont think
oh need take class
sit read
like readable reader coffee table
book one chapter
pluto planet chapter
nine didnt notice know
true oh get
im realizing
get okay right
one chapter talking
big number one
chapter helped one
number right well im trying
find biggest
number possibly think right
many people earth
okay many star galaxy
many galaxy universe
realize say well many
atom star universe
add realize run
thing count
particle left there
would ever need number bigger
get big number
asking combination thing
many outcome many scenario
number one list many
chess game play ran
gave number right
youre fan
chess way back yes yeah um
okay here people
calculated many move
chess game maximum number um
there rule say
go 50 move without moving pawn
capturing capture point
either player declare draw
let make sure dont
want go beyond okay
would mean end game youre
wandering around board yeah
dont let wander around forever
either player able
declare draw let assume
thats rule okay maximum
number move
5900 given rule know go
along 50 move
capture piece go
another 50 move try make last
long possible see see longest
trying calculate maximum number
maximum number okay
move around capturing piece
capture piece
make longest game uh
want promote pawn
queen
four pawn capture piece something
get get lined row
two knight pawn capture
something front rook pawn
black thing
slide past
promote pawn eight pawn go
go yes thats long
pawn take four pawn
dont try capture
pawn try capture piece
first get piece
piece got got pawn get
capture knight okay got
two pawn lined
slide pawn want
make queen end
want make game last long
possible want know
many uh move first move
chess thats 20 move
pawn one two space move
knight there 20 different
move white 20 reply
black number combination
move one 400 20 squar 20 time 20
got keep multiplying number
combination okay want find
chest position
possible
combination move worked
find position
thought anyone else done
people done
said whats move white could
make okay 218 guy figured
king king kind
stalemated decided like one move
resign know
really thought deeply
problem well
knowledge one calculated maximum
number
okay found setup
133 move white 124 reply
black okay multiplied together
16000 combination
figured thats pretty much
maximal player eight queen
board nine kn
dont want piece
start blocking know
put rook
everything get less
get less combination may
maximum combination
hard imagine number
enough okay cuz better
combination okay im
trying get upper limit youd
take number 16000
something product two
number take
5900 power multiply
10
25000 25000 one
25000 zero possible game um
upper limit upper limit possible
game knock knowing
many beginning
many theyd
queen two king left
knock like 237200
whats whats th000 order
magnitude people anyway
friend thousand order magnitude
25000 10 25000 bigger
google far thats 10 hund
yes sometimes see people say
there number chess game 10
120 power thats much bigger
may upper limit
right upper limit includes
completely ridiculous game yeah
course
course play ridiculous game
okay calculation properly
proper upper limit safely
put book put
book put right book
there chapter one
opening chapter get people
warmed number quantum
state size scale
universe trying warm people
yeah right nothing
big number bandaided
yeah attempt taught
first third course right um
michael strauss colleague middle
third final taking u
cosmology right like
follow chess tournament today
took international
chess championship see
carlson defend magus carlson
got u family pas got
member family one day
south street seport
manhattan world
championship heart waring
thing day
chess people loved wanted
take selfies
pleased
astrophysicist would took interest
thing wasnt good
mean interest
cuz son interested played
chessboard beat easy
like 15
something time well thought
good
thats somebody told swim
meat swim anyway travis
took back stage
youll tell say got
give number broadcast
world oh tell world many
possible inter said
say people
live game im
interloper yes tap
content travis got play
move actual champ ship board
yes noticed picked
piece little electronic
thing base wired
beautiful walnut chest set
wired made move show
big board everybody
outside everybody
acoustically insulated space
like oneway glass looking
yeah wonderful
got make magnus carlsons first
move special next day
got make move yes guess
give celebrity status
point clear didnt
choose move would could
started
bad bring night real
first didnt know would
privilege right pointed
pawn would move
press
like exited
hermetically sealed space
invited cuz knew
interest background chess yeah
well big thing chess
ai know computer
play much better right
human play tell first
time beat computer college
playing computer
good feel bad beat
emotion
pulled fast one noticed yeah
didnt move chess piece
highly expected instead
moved different piece stumped
strategy kept thinking he
going move piece
thats going give advantage
organized strategy around
expectation started
moving piece got flumix
found would make mistake
point oh went kill
able beat three
four time realized
0 six something feel
bad thats right well well similar
thing happened chess today
mean first understand
know rule chess
want win happy win
little get pawn end game win
happy trained go
program called alphao played
lee sadal terrific
champion
one game five
amazing game amazing
move joined two area
computer didnt see move coming
thats best move ever played
sport ever computer
go territorial game
black white stone mean thats
right flip yes
try conquer territory right
surround consider way challenging
chess say yeah yes
okay um anyway thing
might consider really stupendous
program go would conquer
know like three quarter field
know kind thing want
win one stone one extra
square want win easiest way
possible game quite
think want chess
computer doesnt testosterone
want win win even
little bit thats better thats quicker
doesnt want conquer slay
doesnt want chase
king around board want
win know game
little dull lot firework
computer versus computer game
sacrifice everything
win one bond know
player today would say
machine
assisted train computer
memorize opening memorize
know carlson look chess magnus
carl magnus say oh know
versus 1934 know
mean memorize
opening play
opening know
player
make suboptimal move
point drive opponent
onto territory dont know
youve practiced variant
weird youd think best
strategy make best move
time get
human opponent track theyre
computer
opponent theyve learned
learned long ago figured
first yes cu move
optimal distracting
strategy theyre
today whats latest fery
paradox fery paradox
emerging thinking well
uh let set stage rico
fery famously declared
given size galaxy
fact galaxy around
long time there plenty time
civilization rise send
mission multiple planet pitch tent
use local resource build
rocket go two planet 4 8 16
hundred million
year easily right without even warp
drive anything right one tenth
velocity life one tenth speed
life modest modern
civilization yes still u
category yet thats
case galaxy could
teaming alien civilization
whats latest thats
said yes okay
wrote paper
1993 called implication
capern principle future
prospect okay astronomer love
capern principle say location
likely special live
around ordinary star ordinary
galaxy ordinary supercluster
used idea used
hyans calculate uh distance
sirius arguing sun
brightest thing universe
thing star theyre
like sun
knowing dim got
distance serus accur factor 20
extraordinary didnt know
calculation brilliant step
make christian hin yes dutch polymath
right yes one book
charming book celestial world
discovered
uh speculates life would
like planet looked
sky said maybe sun
ordinary star
right right brightest
star night sky sirius
like sun far away would
dim see right
given bright sun front
u today even thought
thought brilliant okay
spectacular su success
hubble discovered
galaxy fleeing u edwin
hubble man telescope
named
yes anyway theyre fleeing u
away faster
homogeneous expansion away u
go fall
going say center anymore
going fall
capern au going say
would one special galaxy
others fleeing
look way u must
look way everyone live
galaxy youve got think
youre center youve got see
expanding away
get
homogeneous expansion like uh penny
expanding balloon penny see
others moving away
think center
get homogeneous model
general relativity big bang model
gau student herman alfha
calculated would hot
early universe could see
microwave background radiation left
today based
assumption youre special
get
prediction uh thered
microwave background radiation left
big bang five degree
worked pensis wilson
graduate school project
observed pr
measurement discovered
microwave background 27 de like
predicting flying saucer 50 foot
across going land white
house lawn one 27 foot across
actually show
extraordinary prediction astronomy
show powerful capern
principle slip quick story
sure nsf panel
advise president get
presidential medal science oh yeah
bush george gamma came
someone could earn
im panel biologist
geologist dont know
prediction dont strongly
made case george gamma
prediction given fundamental
cosmology think
still alive well im
proud succeeding
awarded presidential medal
science wow uh okay think
relative came pick part
inspired conversation
much brilliant
extrapolation basic information
universe right
yeah invited dinner um
mother knew friend knew
wife colorado
working one summer got go
student student yeah picked
rollsroyce know
loved rollsroyces um
axle broke rollsroyce sent
team fix said um well
much said
rollsroyce axle
break fee know visited
cornell picked carl
porsche porsche yeah course
well common
okay thats picked
kind car story got equally
good one okay sorry interrupted
paper 1993
people remember know here
answer firmy question
real simple clear youre
purely invoking cernic principle
arrive conclusion yes
fundamentally differently way
gma yes cernic principle layered
onto data available
time okay hyans h yes right
here answer capern
principle simple
significant fraction
extraterrestrial intelligent
observer must still sitting
home planet else youd
special there giant galactic
empire dont know
theyve conquered whole galaxy
theyre hiding know
dont want like u know
little experiment know
would make special
youre intelligent observer
one people big
big one okay fact say
youre person world today
likely born one
country thats median half
country world
looked population less 7
million youre born america thats
one like three big country
dont biggest country
mentioned stephen hawking
said according
principle china said
thats minority people
earth median
97 people living
earth live country median
little bitty country small
population youre likely
youre likely random
place say smiled
okay
thats way stephen hawking
gave characteristic
smile one time dinner
asked question take time
mean plus he eating
spit throat doesnt
work taste food he
typing reply eye right
device right said
come isaac
newton didnt f figure
stabilize solar system needed
figure pertubation theory show
every time planet go around
tugged orbit
jupiter newton upset
didnt know didnt answer
fact credited god coming
fixing thing every
pose question 15
minute later come answer
cant think
everything know thats crazy
drop wisdom went
say einstein didnt think black
hole right right right right cant
think everything thats right people
got nobel prize black hole
right didnt predict
theory predicted gravity w got
nobel prize thats right crumb
plate didnt even get
general relaity
laughter
okay let restate think
understand point yes
cernic principle published 1993
nature right powerful idea
special right
statistically large enough sample
thing
alien colonizing planet
wed one alien colonizing
planet would ask
space colonist
continental
colonist africa home colony home
colonist colonist born
new york didnt colonize dont bring
skin color colony
im talking living
colony africa yes okay born
yeah mo majority
people earth today ill call
colonist came
majority people earth
home lineage
location thats right arrive
ultimately thats right africa
point origin thats right okay
didnt colonize colonist
living colony established
continent africa africa thats
home planet okay
analogize galaxy surface
earth
yes africa home planet home
planet satellite place
human living yes would
planet across galaxy yes capern
principal say likely living
one place yes cuz many
people see
there many nonsp special place
intelligent observer
special place definition
youre likely one many
nonsp special place one one
tiny number special place
clear okay uh example
youre saying alien
like u dont
like u term
statistically home body
home planet
intelligent observer universe
living home planet
intelligent observer
living home planet thats
right go fact
still earth tell u
something example whats chance
colonize whole galaxy
there billion habitable planet
capern principle say odds
u future
billion one
thats truth thats happens
whats chance living
first planet billion
people live billion one
let make little give
another example know there 11
people born antarctica thats
born antarctica theyre born
south everyone else youre
likely wake find
youre
southernmost person ever born youre
one there 11
there eight billion people
youre likely one
yes put constraint
future prospect ask
become multiplanet specie
like two planet like u mar well
happens youre planet one
instead planet two there 50
chance could let
might much improve
longterm survival prospect
specie factor two wed
two chance instead one okay
never fan argument
think two planet specie
cuz fun
survival
reason well um gave talk
yeah elon musk person giv
talk yeah said spiel yeah
good survival
lifeboat know like com basket
store book dont store
alexandrian
library going burn protect
well copy got
sophocles play one stored
elsewhere life used help
survive spread multiply know
gave talk gave talk
said well like survival
argument right thought could
go fun said exactly
famously said dont want die
earth want die mar
impact said missed second
half important half okay
said like talk
know hear tape saying
like previous talk
talk since definitely
used survival argument fact carl
san wrote said think youve
come best argument going
mar even though wrote book
gave 10 different reason one seems
really good space colony
good bargain
send like eight people 30 30 people
live indigenous
material chemical
mar atmosphere forth
great bargain
work youre going
send billion people
thats happening send
small number people
grow doubling population
year great bargain
something certainly
survival thats
disagree disagree rather stay
earth well happens
really bad epidemic earth
sorry disagree
disagree im practical guy
okay im dreamer
circumstance justify okay
otherwise tell like okay
want pitch tent mar grow
civilization human two
planet something bad happens
one planet survivor
planet go im saying
everything bad think
could possibly put life risk yes
effort prevent yes
seems
less shipping billion people
mar dont ship billion
people slim small number know
many people call fine okay
put fertile people mar
fertile people mar start making
baby okay leave alone
okay 100 year let say
there colony th000 people let
say wa 600 year wait thousand year
thousand year yeah right long
take get billion
well 10 billion necessarily need
billion im saying im
saying two planet
something bad going happen one
planet planet going
say oh planned
die carry forth
genome thats going
play youre trying protect
specie case something bad happens
one planet everything
power live
two planet yes youre going
allow planet die youre
going ship fix
problem biol laboratory
deflect asteroid
power power ship
people
mar terraform power
deflect asteroid might put
life risk earth seems
power reverse
geoengineered problem created
earth people worked
hard protecting alexandrian library
titanic hard time
getting people go little
dangerous lifeboat water
comfortable let wait
titanic hard time
getting people go first
boat mar habitable
earth like life life living
comfortably ocean okay
land dangerous
life didnt go wouldnt
wouldnt land animal
ocean always going better
liked analogy gave space
suit like egg egg little
water like taking
sea blood sort salt
like salty water know bringing
nutrient cell know
egg cant survive outside shell
yet chicken chicken cant
right wont come
thats little space suit little
space suit right space
suit thats egg ill
live outside space suit
budget would spend
sending people mar mean got
one entrepreneur want
le mean uh small amount
relative gampp thing get
u maybe something take u
surprise thats argument
possibly embrace there
unforeseen thing could put life
earth risk want two
planet everything foresee
seems would easier solve
ship people mar
youve terraformed people said oh
trashing earth need earth
backup plan whatever
take turn mar earth got
greater effort turn earth
back earth living land
harder living ocean
specie go extinct one
like one island right got
whole universe could
go standing shore
universe would say
said going go
surface earth like
shore theic yeah say probably
andrean smart thing
go mar
something could
generation im saying rich
year youve shared exotic
idea universe got uh
theyre trash bin
failed thats true brilliant idea
failed remember two
yes one still
mystery antimatter go
right early universe
pocket energy
spontaneously becomes matter
eal mc² get pair
particle matter particle
antimatter particle universe
cool pair produced particle
permeate universe
sort come back together
annihilating particle wed
universe photon right okay
dont matter right
photon also matter
doesnt antimatter
counterpart right symmetry law
got broken early universe
cherished symmetry law right right
every matter particle
antimatter particle told
idea there tunneling
antimatter another universe
uh well
idea 1974 early
attempt find might
happened big bang okay
inflation better job
predates inflation bar
predates inflation barely okay
inflation idea came
era high inflation 1980s yeah
yeah yeah 70 early 80
story
done paper gravitational field
tachon found exact solution
gravitational field tachon
hypothetical particle
would go faster light faster
faster light going fast
cant slow light speed
know see one traveling
could infinite speed know
wh line could simultaneous
reference frame okay found
interesting general relativity
solution um
chankov cone radiation gravitational
radiation trailing behind like
sonic boom cone
gravitational radiation coming behind
thats moving faster
speed gravitational wave would
move thats right make
shock wave shock wave right
expanding behind
front collapsing
gravitational wave called
advanced wave one go
backward time photon go forward
time thats asymmetry universe
photon go forward time shake
electron photon go alpha
centaura get four year later
doesnt come alpha centura four
year ago shake electron
electromagnetic wave dont come
infinity meet would
photon going back past
tachon solution life universe
thats time symmetric photon go
either future past
go along straight world line
uh accelerated
energy coming trinov cone
future front made
cone going back
look crosssection
look like two blade pair
scissors tipped small
angle theyre moving speed
light intersection point go
faster speed light like
close pair scissors
intersection point move doesnt
transmit actual thing
moving transmitting energy
information faster speed
light interesting
property well
close pair scissors
point vertex closure
moving faster anything thats
part scissors thats right like
tip right angle move
one foot forward way one foot
forward way scissors
intersection point move square
two line
nothing really moving faster
speed light model
big bang center
matter particle went
future light cone event
went become u
become open universe
would expand forever antimatter
particle went backward time
wheeler showed could positron
equal electron going backward
time idea called
fineman excitedly phone
john ar wheeler 230 stud albert
einstein fan student
called said know
electron mass theyre
electron world line
zigzag time go
electron back positron
electron back positron imagine
tapestry thats woven
vertical line one spool
thread thread go
electron come back positron
electron back
positron seeing
electron positron theyre
still world line one
particle okay look around
see many many blue thread
every electron identically
mass electron
mod electron
saying doesnt
work got matter
particle positron yes
equal number work
universe
would
see positron electron moving
forward time yes positron moving
forward time electron going
backward time theyre
therefore electron yes
see intersection point
present epic yes epic
electron passing
theyre going theyre going
moving slice time
right doesnt wrong idea
got electron
positron also get virtual
pair form
vacuum suddenly there electron
positron pair li little
annihilates
fman showed existed
vacuum forth
use calculating know
magnetic moment certain thing
forth know uh
one electron okay
matter seeing
electron thing point
yes well here isolated pair
youve made nothing thats
little loop string connected
connected
part one piece
come physic
electric field forth okay mean
caltech audited mr fan
course qu electrodynamics didnt
homework aut set
back got
point said figured
could use electron positron
electron going backwards fan
diagram nearly fell
chair important
part fan diagram um
ton would go antimatter go
past light cone event
tends go toward present
event big space
absolute future absolute past
uh inflation much better job
frankly
brilliant idea youve happened
wrong happened
wrong guess could
wrong well thought bubble universe
1982 goth problem
inflation end uniformly wanted
like wanted boil water pot
turn steam
vacuum energy early inflating
universe turn particle wanted
universe
would uniform unfortunately
would form bubble thats
uniform dont see
answer live one
bubble bubble universe
expands turn open
universe inside
bubble see toward past
uniform vacuum dont see
bubble yet
solution problem lindy came
idea month later
uh albre
steinhardt short order
thing particle
physic well general
relativity became whats known
new inflation thats better idea
okay truth
thats always good yes
let tell higs
ban mexican hat potential
youve seen start
large vacuum energy youre top
center mexican hat marble
top roll land
somewhere bottom rim brim
thing thats today
much vacuum energy bon
oscillate oscillation
give positive mass hi
boson okay concave
early universe
convex mean squar
mass squared negative number
mean imaginary mass
mean
tonic like tachon early
universe vacuum decay
get something called tachon
condensate like youve created
tachon
turned tonic higs boson
behave like tachon instead
wave function thats
sinusoidal wave function
um uh
exponential decay
quickly dont last long
exponential decay exponential decay
know people say well
really free tachon know
whittens written paper tonic thing
student matthew cedc written
paper tonic condensate early
universe maybe tachon role
ear universe still ill keep
radar recently past
future radar neil turac proposed
boundary condition
early universe like mirror
look back mirror see
mirror image u antimatter
going way really
mirror boundary condition
he coming
like thing
leing lee youve seen there
little time loop beginning
universe like there tree
trunk branch coming
trunk inflating
universe lind picture leion
le said one
branch simply curl back around
grows trunk
little time microscopic time machine
virtual pair like little
time machine go electron come
back positron make little lo
talk book yeah
time travel einstein universe right
selfconsistent solution
got little time loop beginning
found stable quantum vacuum
state stable solution
selfconsistent solution
say photon uh go
toward future solves
problem photon go toward
future observe
temperature loop zero
calculate temperature
particle
come start seeing hawking
radiation heat cant
see branch uh
universe start low entropy
state go higher entropy state
could explain entropy eror
time would great prediction
theory one noticed
unfortunately theyve noticed
post prediction
postdiction postdiction would say yes
uh number
interesting feature there
six different idea okay
one know
right youre
theorist first introduce
concept gin
particle yes give fast
explanation
fascinated well there movie
called somewhere time yes know
one christopher ree
christopher
go place michigan big
hotel ive fell
love actress saw picture
ill love girl got
meet girl said well shes died
1908 know un fortunately
go old professor
talked time trial old physic
professor yeah physic
well long story short he able go
back time meet fall love
forth happens
motivates try go back
there old woman strangely
come hand gold
watch say come back
know doesnt know woman
think locket
kind watch watch
watch watch time travel
movie watch go look
actress see oh god
actress fell love
picture saw thing shes
old woman came know want
come back handed
watch watch okay he
got watch take watch back
okay back time meet
fall love etc etc theyre
planning future together
successfully go back
time advice physic
professor yes thats right he got
watch say oh thats
interesting watch youve got hand
shes holding
see penny he brought
shouldnt 1979
something break spell know
time travel go
away he back present
forgot swap currency
appropriate wanted
everything authentic got old kind
fashioned clothes everything
forgot
coin coin pocket broke
spell know really
physic anyway broke
spell he back back
president never get back
look watch
watch hand take
watch get old take
watch delivers
brings back time give
give watch
association watch factory
circular world line called
gin particle j n j n n n jin
like genie okay jin
circular world line one
created one destroyed right
life time loop way
virtual particle like
electron positron pair formed
disappears little loop
sitting formed
okay explain
got realize back
future yes marty
playing tune chuck barry
chuck barrys cousin yes hired
perform dance yes he marty
play right okay right here
marty play right chuckberry song
thats right get phone call
chuck barry say hey chuck
sound youve looking check
hold yeah
song song
song thats j didnt
notice didnt get didnt get
allowed call
nonmaterial object gin jin thing
song never written yes
never created right life
loop ab absolutely thing
comment would
time loop time machine
electron go around
complete circle
going toward future time
curved space time like mellan
went west crew went west
time got back europe
curved thing occur
know story
scribe whatever call people
kept note ship pigafetta
name oh
interloper wealthy italian guy
bought seat trip yeah
kept good record every day
yes okay know
sun hit day
gone right come
around think monday thats
right whatever everyone else say
sunday whichever order
he thinking town people
playing practical joke
right oh thats good story yes
discovery need
international date line right
happened mellon voyage right
gen particle thats
electron one electron gen
particle thats complicated like
watch would say watch
less probable
find like virtual particle
electron positron could
virtual know leonard nemoy
antimatter counterpart form
disappear thats less probable
happen um single
electron would agree
song mar saying
thats thats g good insight
okay thats wouldnt
thought would thought
think thought right
rich ive kept list whole life
movie portrayed genius behavior
people always intrigued
thought itd fun show
kid right thing
value like smart one
life right one thing
couldnt wrap head around somehow
everyone belief youre really
really really smart move object
mind like come
say theyre
saying solve problem
faster better
come solution
others couldnt theyre mind going
make top spin middle
table im accepting
get smartest person youve ever
known met heard
chance smart would
power thered suspicious thing
happening
presence even mildest sens
somehow screenwriter cant
resist storyteller cannot resist
right happened movie lucy
lucy yes shes scarlet johansson getting
smarter smarter cuz shes taking
drug shes using
mind shes shes shes moving
using power mind already
never tapped people
coming gun
levitates ceiling knock
gun shes walking
street change color hair
love
movie know wife named
lucy shes smart havent
caught levitating thing around
house yet mean
something come youre
floating ceiling iphone
