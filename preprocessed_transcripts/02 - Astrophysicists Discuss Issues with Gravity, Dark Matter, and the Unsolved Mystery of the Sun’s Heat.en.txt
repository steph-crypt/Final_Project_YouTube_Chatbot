dark matter yes call dark
matter ordinary matter another
universe whose gravity spilling
universe there
dimension going universe
next universe
thats dimension
gravity would leak basically
universal pressure feeling
universe
really leaky pipe
music
star talk special edition
cosmic query variant
special edition cosmic
query gary
house gary hey neil there
gary special edition
gary special yes everyone know
gary always good chuck
always pleasure back saddle
thats right cosmic query
grabb bag grab
bag used call galactic
gumbo n guarantee used call
thats right come
put little get air fet
going move get
little good gumbo know also
hood hell geek
chief charles
hell hell oh guy
sweet hell charles lou uh
visiting college staten
island cutuney system thanks
coming office hayden
planetarium always much fun
people know
involved opened place
part scientific staff
helped write exhibit design
thing
cool want
25th anniversary opening
rose center wow want
say thank pleasure
thank giving chance
coauthored book
time called one universe home
cosmos robert irrian robert
irri thats right who science
writer uh three u
celebration bringing
science earth facility
got band back together
twothirds band back together
special edition grab bag
see weve broken three
category first one black hole
next one mixed bag
yes third one
mixed bag mixed bag thank
thank cuz ran idea
uh okay right get
start go straight yeah kick
question come patreon
listener yes
one access question
list yeah right get preference
five buck month uh
someone wrote said listen
cant afford patreon could please
ask question dont
3000 month guy asked
said yeah
like wrong
show
show writing wait
patreon yeah way
show cuz need go
something didnt
patreon people 3000 month
amazing oh way charles
might know answer
simultaneously mhm okay he
science battle
yes two scientist enter one scientist
leaf never cross beam
defer charles many
count okay sit
admire come mouth
okay thats easy right
let said
well see well see go yeah right
tom sturgill said hello chuck
charles neil he florida
general relativity tell u gravity
force reaction space
time mass okay quantum theory
tell u may parallel universe
instead dark energy might
seeing effect mass
universe spacetime damn
got badass great question
start excellent thats well thought
question yeah wait
mean like
game thats who watching show
yeah want phrase
there
another astrophysicist
like let see deal
get aholes see really
know theyre talking okay
start idea
gravity really force want hear
think thats
wonderful uh tom youre absolutely
right general theory
relativity superseded theory
cover uh includes say isaac
newton original universal theory
gravity small scale
like scale earth scale
solar system example cannot tell
difference small thing like
solar system yeah exactly cannot
tell difference acceleration
curv richer spacetime gravity
got look almost
exactly look
exactly small scale
experiment done
show whether gravity like
true force truly curvature
spaceime far two
follow socalled equivalence
principle
onesially
right circumstance
circumstance
come extreme environment youre
looking sort earthlike
local environment one example
black hole right might
indeed circumstance
tell difference
gravitational activity curve
curvature spacetime gravitational
activity force measure
exactly like curvature
much semantics like
care whether curvature
newtonian accelerates object
let force
even bickering matter
trying understand
extreme situation black
hole beginning universe
subtle difference
come account take
account order get
science right okay otherwise get
wrong answer good okay
learn take
physic class chemistry
force electromagnetic weak
nuclear force strong nuclear force
yes know add gravity
fourth force youre
saying shouldnt add gravity
problem gravity creating
strange boundary condition
standard model particle
use know quark
lepttons thing like
include particle move gravity
around gravity fundamental
force exist particle
expect called graviton
based understanding
force mediating
particle graviton must
detected wait hang
propagates electromagnetic force
photon propagates weak
force w z particle thats
obvious
propagates strong
force gluon ought
keeping tradition sort
standard model particle
associated force gravity
particle associated
graviton
graviton yes thats right photon
gluon gluon graviton
intermediate vector bzon let
ask though photon
mass right correct none
gluon mass gluon
mass either z
actually w z particle
mass yeah thats go
thats whats going
particle still
studied trying figure
well know
maybe concept mass
worth talking moment
mass energy equivalent
right switch back forth
say
massless particle right
saying nothing saying
carry energy
converted mass right
condition right photon
example much energy
baseball powerful
photon wont measure
scale baseball thrown pitcher
yeah right baseball yeah
well e mcÂ² right implicit
statement baseball
thrown 90 mph huge
amount stuff thats even though
mass given
one mystery
standard model subatomic
universe work indeed mass
doesnt mass
right call energy
potential mass could could
call yes happens
bring tom concept
quantum physic right general
relativity quantum mechanic
real hard time connecting
try use
idea particle explain gravity
motion thing get stuck
theory math doesnt quite match
speculation tom
hey black hole
general relativity whatever uh could
affected quantum physic
idea case many world
interpretation could could
math doesnt show yet
actually frontier
trying wonder uh folk
speculated could actually use
quantum physic communicate within
black hole go interior
one black hole able
transfer interior another
black hole still wouldnt
translate would
ever find cant get
information black
hole math work
speculative way black hole stay
far know right cosmic
fight club
never dont talk event
horizon yeah fight club stay tuned
tom would say uh odds
speculated
case mathematically people still
working way make possible
figure
test see make
prediction actually manifest
observation think day
come well discover graviton
yes pretty close already okay
reason close
gravitational wave detector
found right people
making calculation saying well
gravitational wave actually exist
shown
must graviton right
implication graviton exist
matter actually
detecting one bugaboo
graviton uh low energy right
there many
able pick one enough
data show particle
actually exist extremely difficult
wild right right man
wow wish spoke math
fine let go parker
man say uh parker man parker
man right parker man greeting
dr lou tyson lord nice ventura
california parker man thinking
colliding black hole wonder
happens prior merger
event horizon consider binary
pair black hole slowly spiraling
towards assuming
original star formed
time would sense
rotation revolution
would include frame
dragging around body
horizon merge region
collision sort
linear motion frame dragging
opposite direction
effect would confluence opposing
frame motion might stress
spaceime increase hawking radiation
temporarily even possibly trigger
vacuum decay hole massive
enough man let tell something
first dont trying get u
advanced physic homework
thats number one right number
two make question shorter
exactly
holy crap first
somebody study astrophysics
know tom hand tell u
frame dragging whats deal
yeah frame drag colliding black hole
frame dragging yes get closer
closer event horizon
youre moving right time sense
dilation becomes visible
youre one direction
compared direction
rotation motion whatever
youll actually wind different
view object right
kind thats sort basic
general concept frame
reference thats right
frame reference
dragged gravitational curvature
uh space time wait let
think show show people
youre talking cuz dont
think people understand black hole
youre talking youre actually
talking something tangible
tangible theyre moving
towards
spiral around around around
hit right right
clear hardly ever
universe two object falling
towards exactly
line collision like two
two train track right
exactly exactly there always
nonalignment there
nonalignment opportunity
spiraling thats correct
question parker man done
wait parker new superhero
parker man
anyway parker saying
parker youre saying exactly right
right youre wondering
interaction two black hole
spiral closer closer
answer gravitational wave
get gravitational wave released
get energy come
way black hole collides
lead difference kind
energy get released
quantity direction
thing like question
answer short answer
question neil tell im
wrong yes okay
thing possibility
individual collision cause
kind thing squirt
still subject intense research
geometry whats going
yeah also comment
something wish true
betting person odds
true dark matter yes
call dark matter ordinary matter
another universe whose gravity
spilling universe
tom concept right yeah yeah
im even though know
dark matter probably exotic
particle thats right wasnt
directly related black hole
question side point
right thing would cool
like said there mathematical
possibility well open many
learned talking brian green
brian brian
brian cox brian green yeah hang
brian may brian may well
yeah oh wait thats freddy sorry
oh yeah yeah guitar
think yeah uh
follow follow talking
ry may group
guitarist queen queen
ask kid he physic
astrophysical terrifying youre
conversation charles
brian may queen astro
phd astrophysics brian cop
queen queen thats
correct queen hasnt technically
dissolved queen keep bringing
exactly like foreigner yes right
learned
made complete sense every
dimension add mhm strength
force emanating point
strength force diluted
power r dimension
okay word
flat
ask quickly cone
spread go 1 r
squared flat area
cone grows one r
there area there
surface perimeter yeah
yeah yeah youre talking perimeter
yeah perimeter thats
strength perimeter flat
surface strength drop one
r gotcha volume
thats two dimension right
threedimensional volume strength
drop surface sphere
get bigger thats r squared mhm
four dimension there
dimension going uni spatial
dimension going universe
next universe thats
thats higher dimension thats
dimension
gravity would leak right would
power gravity would drop
precipitously one
music
r third power third power
way faster ordinary gravity
universe mean
currently dark matter
universe 56 source
gravity expressed universe
right correct dominating
universe right already
dominating universe
dropped third power
distance fourth dimension
mean never go come
thats hellified gravity
universe never go
right right im im
eating lunch almost like choked
eating lunch think brian
green yeah like wow
thought
come dimensionality
dimension reach u
thats way dark matter work yeah
he he particle thats
really cool though thats kind cool
cuz basically universal
pressure feeling
universe really
leaky pipe
man bathroom got water
floor messing whole
universe boy dont hope dont
cuz fly apart oh gosh
come else
im im expert
quantum physic learn
force propagate told
whose knowledge trust value
force cannot exit
spacetime gravity g
explained
try follow nod
said casually
like guess like
course people know know
parker tom also would
recommend look something called
randall sundrum theory okay
suggests gravity leakage
another spacetime dimension could
indeed lead thing
talking right uh lisas book
lisa lisa randall yeah wrote
book called warped passage
exploration higher dimension
cool yeah shes friend
shes contemporary came
together graduate school oh uh
oh
uh yes shes professor
harvard department physic
right stronger gravity move
migrates dimension space
time becoming weak yeah okay
like biological like
tunneling rather diffusion yeah
thats better uh
continued yeah guy look
really cool let jump mix
bag okay matt kota uh mod mat
yes paris paris france rather
paris texas okay say
yes
going give credit
think
cultured enough think want
paris across ocean think
want make difference playing
listen youre france believe
dont want associated
texas way let honest
know texas
yeah recent supernova data revealing
something mindbending
universe instead mysterious dark
energy scientist found evidence
time flow different rate
throughout space faster vast
empty void slower matter clump
together think thats scientific
term like einstein time dilation
cosmic scale witnessing
generation capernac moment
basic understanding cosmos need
rewritten new model
right mean fate
universe interesting wow charles
read read
paper uh cannot tell whether
actually capernican revolution
right think
he referring may way
interpret data another way
einstein cosmological
constant right vary right one
time universe another whereas
equation constant okay
something give well
original equation
lambda right lambda uh function
time built equation
first proposed lambda
certainly something
mathematically possible whether
theory allow
theory accurate description
world saying
world cant time dependent lambda
world time
dependent lambda theory
complete knew theory
complete designed thats
true thats whole point yeah th
think exactly mut
describing right time
supplement
longstanding theory something
new right whether
capernac moment think
probably interpretation
would simpler follow aams razor
necessarily require
brand new physic right example
big clump uh matter
know act like gravitational
lens right gravitational lensing
cause example light
coming distant object behind
lens appear curved around
right result could much
easily explain observation
supernova
gravitational lensing effect
complicated thing dont
understand need bring
whole new varying cosmological constant
kind physical would add point
recently explainer
chuck titled wrong
capernacus wrong sure
ask well throw
entire idea sun
middle universe look
adjustment basic idea
50 year later kepler would discover
ellipsis opposed perfect circle
aspect idea
needed modification without
throwing whole idea im
charles could
important scientific moment
scale capernican moment
matt know even wrong
thats necessarily bad right
think science help u
understand understand
science process learning whats
right wrong demanding
right go home rather
im right aspect youre right
aspect together reach
something thats complex
either u could achieved
world child
excellent theyre singing
way fact person
name
matt come u paris france
mean parisian presumably
offended imitation
parisian
french people well let hope cuz
quite frankly bad imitation uh
french people pretty spoton
100 smoking
cigarette french best
lung world
withstand smoking know lung
abnorm
okay im sorry funny dont
care yall say funny
funny funny dude
taking long answer
question let speed right
okay go trisha lynch
hello dr tyson trisha lynch yes
say hello dr tyson dr lou
lord nice gary uh trisha
beaverton oregon uh
really life water europa
one moon
way u observe
without possible crosscontamination
yes yes yes yes yes probably
well
whole episode europa
clipper mission
archive check yeah nasa
office planetary protection
correct primary goal make
sure crosscontamination
happen saving u thanos
example there famous uh
short story awardwinning short story
written physicist david brin called
giving plague bring back
pathogen mar uh giving
tree shell silverstein shell
silverstein right different different
book number one important
thing make sure
spacecraft dont crash right want
make sure orbit
solid enough boosting
situation end
mission dispose spacecraft
way contaminate
potential environment
happened galileo space
probe cassini space crew around
jupiter saturn respectively
crashed cassini purposely crashed
galileo purposely well
crashed atmosphere
jupiter saturn
know burned oh
yeah exactly instead landing
somewhere contaminating space
would burnt
careful
space sadly issue
local near near earth orbit
ecosystem quickly approaching
point astronomy done
earth badly affected
stuff thats going
get bunch reflection bunch
crossing streak
kind terrible thing mess
information thats right
make quite difficult
fortunately yet case
far know place like europa
make sure spacecraft isnt
going crash next thing
find remote sensing strategy
example look ice
crust mar see whats
right fact
thing without landing something
thing like kind
radar use crust mar
talking h talking
crust mar
talking there ice mean
pole pole yes fact
continent full mar
uh know ice there lot
ice penetrating radar yes
way even
weather radar
machine melt ice made
former martian atmosphere able
see could see
could see martian
technology absolutely yes well
reactive
let get total total recall
one one traumatic science
fiction movie ive ever seen
book right
remember wholesale uh
written philip k dick thats kind
cool book read sometime want
check dont know
exactly thats wild wild
know movie thing
charles know thing okay fine
forgot remind thats
show okay answer
question yeah man
possible without
crosscontamination oh yeah
fact weve already done well
wait ice penetrating
radar probably wont see
microorganism there
microscopic fish itll see right
thats right yeah therein
lie next point let say
find beautiful blue whale something
know gigantic whale shark fish
type thing
next study
communicate forth right
edible
first thought charles
office planetary protection
really think hard going
put submarine right go
want something
go surface
case protect ecosystem
idea good thing
europa ice crack water
come refreezes freeze
there suggestion
pitch tent surface let slowly
sinking
could dig material
came froze thaw
possibly see without
fish happen get caught
could alaska
cut hole drop pole
yes line mean
way like
there like may
done im saying hello dr
tyson dr lou assuming chuck
gary assumed right um
lily rose virginia
question data recent
probe flying close sun give u
use mission
future explore nature
star galaxy curious
goal mission thank
uh
rose thank great question
great question
something parker solar probe
recently oh
explainer put
context people whove never
heard dont know deeply
went science would come
know went faster
previous spacecraft closer
sun previous spacecraft
got hotter previous spacecraft
going study solar wind
course solar flare particle
flux sort thing see well
solar science number amazing
question surprisingly still
dont know answer even though
sun close u right 93
million mile away one question
transition surface
sun photosphere
11000 degree fahrenheit
yeah 11000 well started
give chance
corona sun
million degree million right
actually youd imagine
away get sun
colder get
get colder colder colder
suddenly right boundary roughly
less less less warm
okay cold
there part sun thats cold
fair enough fair enough get
boundary suddenly right
area parker solar probe
starting probe heat
energy
transferred kind mechanism
growing temperature
10000 million wait
cooling literally see
decrease temperature
sudden surface surface
photosphere get
corona sudden
heat thats right
photo corona
reaction like
identify might making something
like happen solar probe
oh god think
came idea
dont send something
investigate temperature change
completely around circumference
isolated pocket piece piece
really kind like envelope
envelope hole
inhomogeneous heterogeneous shall
say also actually
layer photosphere
corona called
chromosphere area
mysterious u
hypothesis earth
heating happens energy
transfer surface star
space need tested
data parker solar probe help u
understand star transfer
energy outward affect
everything thats orbiting star
planet nasa call space
weather right put
little molecular talk
temperature average vibration
speed molecule get
surface sun
vibrating something happens
theyre vibrating faster
right okay somethings flinging
energy source pumping
corona rarified
would would holding aside
radiation sun sure
youre bath million degree
like molecule hitting
would feel like
wouldnt feel like much
irony although temperature
corona million degree
put potato corona
corona really wouldnt bake
amount heat plasma
tiny per unit volume volume
potato wouldnt actually
enough heat bake potato
energy flowing
long period time would fry
potato dissolve atom
like due course energy
flow strong energy density
low kind
contradiction need get data
parker solar probe help
u understand
page cup coffee hot mhm
iceberg heat total
heat cup coffee heat
total added vibrational energy
molecule cup coffee
temp put thermometer read
something different total
energy different thats
getting information back
get transferred radio
thing like okay oh got
shield way said would
got hotter anything
shield actually keep electronics
quite cool okay whats time 8
minute 8 minute 20 second
course
light pretty much oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah 8
minute 20 second equal
many second dont know im
going sit 500 second
nice round number thats cool yeah
right know im better
knowledge youll never
forget yes thank right
olexander
sameno
sam oxander alexander sound
ukrainian sound eastern block
uh listen say hello dr tyson
dr lou chuck gary im alexander
oh kev hey ukraine charles
wild guess said
eastern block thats said right
yeah say here question
entire universe exists
time loop big bang happens
appear develop science find
underlying building block
universe ignite new universe
one start fall apart uh
let light matter fact
universe sort jin
particle
let point alexander thank
great question short story
written isaac azimoff isaac
said favorite amongst
everything wrote called
last question last question yes
isaac way trying
figure question
described fact cosmology
throughout world whats story
book short
story quick im going
spoil single thing story
got got got go read
look brilliantly
written clean story way giving
u homework damn know cant
believe professor im
sorry go im trying sneak
answer
slapping isaac azimov
dont know know hed never flew
anywhere whatever reason
native new yorker ever
heard speak would obvious
friend museum
yes fact research done
physic astro biology
novel uh nonfiction book
researched library
american museum natural history
cool annual
panel debate honor isaac
azimov memorial panel let give
shout late wife also janet
jeepson azimov writer
right wow look yeah
whats deal deal gym
particle could dont
evidence confirm yet
speculation thats gone
cosmology around world
human civilization yeah
would end dont know unless
recolapse start end need
right doesnt point
need new physic right physic
physic already oh im
happy also think
incomplete
physic expansion
universe go forever
thats big
rip scary
something else sure
thats case yet right
something like vacuum decay
know word threw
around im sorry idea
vacuum energy level universe
false vacuum fact
still energy hiding
cataclysmic event could cause
energy released rift
physic
mathematical root
experimental verification cosmic
query star talk book there whole
section topic thats
right
spooky cool
spooky scary cool
think really neat possibility
happening time
lifetime even human specie
lifetime minuscule chance
happening eventually thats non
zero imagine way
universe reignites
fact condition big
bang happened
continues depending
state universe energy density
matter density whatever indeed
particular idea cyclical
universe continues come back
time little bit different
next time
law physic alexander know
youre far lot
theoretical physicist thinking
right would add want give
little punctuation comment
false vacuum
puddle water sitting
puddle
thank like ledge
little sort depression
another ledge
there area water collect
okay say lowest
energy state water water
well side
ledge get lower
living thinking stable
right thats stable
configuration puddle
stable puddle entire
place place lower
lower part lower part
quantum construction universe
possible puddle tunnel
barrier spill
occupy next place right
state universe
stable base there fear
factor end tunneling
place whole
rule dont know whatll
happen die somebody draining
pool
let make sure everyone
know 2025 designated
international year quantum science
technology united nation
book came time
handy
handy quantum physic answer book
answer book one series three
youre like main guy one
physic astronomy quantum
quantum physic came time
yes okay everybody please enjoy
conversation right
hope springboard
going checking
year
100th anniversary
people designate sort firm
foundational birth quantum physic
whole 1920s slap right
middle yeah youve got
youve got youve got origin
story youve got origin story
quantum physic charles good
man thank much
always pleasure great talk
everybody question
marvelous love im
bought book dude thank
bought book get one
u
get camera got one
quantum
tunnel get book
thank jeff buy
shovel
charles good man
always dude really appreciate love
family everybody thank
gary pleasure always
pleasure right neil degrass tyson
