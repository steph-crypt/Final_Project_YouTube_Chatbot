take frontier particle
physic today there tremendous
progress exciting
time fundamental physic
particle physic said
gravitational astronomy exploration
force gravity black hole
quantum information quantum computing
sort stuff
utterly fascinating think
first time probably true say
particle physic dont know
there anything else around
corner bad know
also duty find thing
nature star talk neil degrass
tyson youre personal astrophysicist
today featuring exclusive
oneonone interview friend
colleague across pond brian cox
brian welcome hi great back
oh god gosh oh
tooo long yeah dont usually get
person usually
zoom something right let get
biography state
side people might fully know
uh cut teeth
particle physicist correct yeah
initially mean actually degree
university manchester way
uk ive never left started
undergraduate degree
postgraduate call
professor particle
physic university manchester
yeah royal
society royal society
london yeah royal society professor
public engagement science yeah
kindred soul across atlantic
yeah okay never left
wanted badly
one else wanted yeah probably
latter started actually
um physic astrophysics degree
degree physic
astrophysics phd particle
physic although first year
working supernova neutrino
crossing astroparticle physic
would call got
particle physic went daisy
laboratory hamburg work
electron proton collision called
defc scattering ive seen daisy online
ive seen daisy simulation thing
simulate like colliding black hole
thing fascinating daisy dy
theut synchron yeah
public facing platform see didnt know
didnt know
accelerator longer operational
big huge lab
hamburg phd thats
particle physic moved fermilab
chicago cern
building large hadron
collider ive always
switzerland yes geneva remind
thats center european center
nuclear research research acony french
acronymed yeah founded
1950s time
part reconstruction
europe really war
lab founded think 1954
1953 um nuclear physic
time wasnt really
thing particle physic suppose
time far
world largest accelerator particle
physic lab yeah mean center
mass whole world left united
state stopped funding super
texas yeah ssc super conducting
supering super collider yeah would
called super duper collider
might kept funding
point uh yeah europe still lead
world nuclear particle
research
international lab mean
world cider um although
based switzerland france would
say world lab
okay thats diplomatic well
certainly mean u
tremendous presence example
youre saying
youre describing branch
life musician
briefly remind yes
uh 18 traditionally would go
university start physic
degree didnt
band rock band joined
im sure parent love
fact actually
loved could go college major
physic continue band oh
thing like gap
year call say well im
going take year study
go college university
id said id said im going
band im going
year ill go
physic h got record
deal uh big record deal aampm
record 1986 1987 long
time ago got big record deal
came los angeles recorded
album uh actually produced larry
kleene married joanie
mitchell time recorded
janie mitchell studio
los angeles toured
uh first professional gig
band jimmy page jimmy pagee
open jimmy page yeah
open jimmy pagee gary moore
whod also band thing lizzy
europe final countdown
know song final
countdown carri big h
u opened made
couple album basically
five year charted uh
actually big show
rock roll band
left band um went
straight back manchester went
start physic degree one yes
little gap joined
another band hit
record band called
early 90 didnt
record deal joined
got record deal well
university
band number one hit uk
australia song violates
second law thermodynamics
youll love call thing get
better clearly incorrect
certainly thing could get worse
globally universe exactly
yeah two
song helped remember
correctly political candidate
adopted theme song tony blair
ton blair yeah tony
blair
1997 associated election
yeah came back actually fashion
change
administration uk uh
song came came
got quite popular
glastonbury year band wait
thats huge place yeah big
festival yeah thats hu huge
scene musician uk
location well world mean
probably biggest festival
world would imagine would guess
huge festival brian
may two
way around though
got
extremely well yeah got extremely
famous finished phd
astrophysics yeah okay brian may good le
guitarist queen queen yes yeah
let pick physic
right la vega uh
world skeptic conference yeah yeah uh
skeptic mean
scientist skeptic problem
world weird thing who
going put check somebody
got show scene say
thats work law
physic prevent youve
youve uk right
there certain resonance
united state uk
people misthink thing
baptism world well actually
mean interested
research long time
postar part
career didnt want know
anything else research
thats um uh
cant remember
one regular funding crisis
youll know u
government support particular
research dipped got
involved trying fight
realize mean kind obvious
suppose realize one
reason talking government
cut research budget
didnt think anyone cared
thought simple thing demy
could
community reed learned
weve learned year
learned popular support
popular support uh
important support
come come understanding
could many reason
way uh talking people
science
scientist important one
course purely democratizing
knowledge tax payer fund
least part therefore
right know there
level level
think youre suggesting well um
science think
knowing fact
really knowing
universe 138 billion year old
example 138 billion year since
big bang could talk
later actually mean
bite origin time p anyway
put well get back
okay knowing
fact much
understanding something
process acquire reliable
knowledge world
science process
acquire reliable knowledge
think realiz well
yeah sense think
sense nature whether
job scientist
find work course
richard fan many others famously
said doesnt care
opinion popular
many vote got anything
much money youve got doesnt care
sense think unique
pursuit standard
opinion judged
external u nothing
humanity nature ultimate judge
jury executioner think
became involved initially
narrow idea wanted make
sure people understood
value
branch became bigger
bigger career branch
stein television live show
sort thing came
thats wasnt interested
communicating science
interested long
time certain duty
responsibility world well think
mean ive realized since
think uh actually fan
said brilliant essay
anyone download 1955 think
called value science
four page calex
archive think say
duty scientist
duty knowing great value
call defines science
satisfactory philosophy ignorance
beauti
merely satisfactory philosophy
ignorance start
knowing said said
great value satisfactory
philosophy ignorance great value
freedom thought proclaim
freedom try protect
coming generation essentially say
end like framing
duty scientist
well job find
thing nature
natural world uh
conference bestow upon
richard dawkins award science
reason bestow bestow yes richard
dawkins award something last
year uh called back
bestow upon
great honor
delight take place tonight
yeah look forward
idea science reason
something maybe sad
something need
rewarded one
award world functioned
right wouldnt need also
know although said fan said
sense duty
scientist also true
scientist want want
feel comfortable said
didnt want um initially
much enjoy think
important dont need
everybody
people thats thats important
right discussing big idea expert
physicist biologist
entertainer politician
favorite way critically explore
world around u spacexs
starship track ramp
launch elon musk turning visionary
idea real progress however since
cabinet appointment trump

let get back show let talk
physic take frontier
particle physic today whats going
cern pig boan
discovered nobel prize
granted uh well
close shop go home
mean particle physic
talking quantum
mechanic basically statistical
sense collide
collide proton together
high energy collide lot
proton together high energy proton
charge put
magnetic field accelerate
yeah high speed yeah
go lhc
kilometer 27 kilm thats
number yeah 60 mile something
like uh proton go
around ring uh 11000 time
second thats fast go thats
fast thats
99999999 speed light okay
youve granted energy
collide break
apart youre basically deconstructing
nature
see residue come
think anything else
going break right dont take
chair slam together still
chair pile
kindling okay ever thought
good idea smash nature
well um suppose er
rutherford initially um go back
manchester turn 20th century
rutherford using radioactive
decay um essentially produce
particle mean decay
decay atomic nucleus
naturally happens produce high energy
particle fired gold
foil bounced foil
discovered atomic
nucleus one way think
particle physic
collide thing together
youre really building
microscope one way think
higher energy
collision faster thing
traveling uh smaller
smaller object see
talking seeing first
time experiment atomic
nucleus move forward um
well ultimately 50
60 higher higher energy
collision start seeing
nucleus made proton neutron
start seeing 50
60 proton neutron
made smaller thing called quark
discover weve
discovered anything smaller
way dont
enough energy bust quark yes
well well resolve whats inside
let say build microscope
right inventory
fundamental particle includes quirk
yeah somebody saying thats
fundamental sound little like
greek saying atom fundamental
oh wont fundamental youre
absolutely right uh look
point like point view
energy generate today
thats one side particle
physic weve exploring
structure matter
historically know go back
rutherford suppose
confidence break matter
apart didnt break matter youre
deconstructing yeah youre
really think way think
think collision
let say collide
phd electron proton together
get electron beam proton
beam smash
whats actually happening whats
actually happening one way
collision happen
electron emit photon
particle light particle
light go hit ph
proton wavelength
light telling
small thing see
proportional energy thing
thats hard smashing
thing together
together yeah faster smash
together higher energy
smaller smaller thing
see thats way
thinking particle collision
really microscope sense
analogy work im thinking
proton wouldnt want
busted apart quirk would
nice day way
suppose like kind
like xray suppose isnt
youre right though hit hard
enough fall bit
would would
would try hit ex
bit fell one
considered
fundamental bit neil right
way think particle
physic think say
higs particle mentioned thats
proton youre youre
smashing thing together finding
higs particle buried
somewhere side really
think einstein famous equation
eal mc2 energy mass
interchangeable let put like
also say load
energy collision
make new particle extremely
massive much massive would
come spontaneously available
energy would otherwise
nothing collide
proton together energy
plenty energy make higs
particle example top quar
heavy particle well far
massive proton
thats suppose way think
trying manufacture higs particle
observe need enough
energy make youre
buing apart youre creating
opportunity view massive
particle would otherwise
available yeah
thing say get complete
picture massive thing
like higs particle um
short lifetime make
decay away lighter particle
fast dont see higs
particle see debris
decay higs particle
challenge particle
physic get detect bit
came basically way
also bit proton
got smashed well
big mess
hard
dont one proton collision
per send particle around
little bunch basically
get 10 20 30 collision time
one good day
interesting one
youve got sift
difficulty
professional challenge let say
particle physic reasoning
there always next energy level
havent visited yes
interesting physic reveal
get um
challenging moment
socalled standard model higs
particle
minute thing existence
thing predicted 1960s
peter higs others um
suggestion theory guess let say
time mathematically motivated almost
purely way mathematically
motivated thing get mass
universe fundamental level
quark
heavy thing called w z boson
thing got
um mathematical
construct predicted
simplest case one thing
higs bose could
complicated version knew
collided proton together
energy generate large
handron collider would either
discover higs bos prove
theory correct knew
wasnt would see something
else clear idea
experiment theory going
discover something machine
dont know turned
simplest thing
thing peter higs
dreamt year ago
astonishing way 50 year
prediction there there
great essay might know
eugene vigner called unreasonable
effectiveness mathematics physical
science think thats one
best example astonishing
achievement got right
discover higs bo put
precision winers point
paper math
vacuum pun intended make discovery
mathematical representation
physical idea yeah pursue
math applies universe
physical idea
captured reality
fundamental way although
think
mathematical framework became
standard model particle physic based
idea symmetry sort
beautiful idea really
mathematical foundation there
aesthetic sense think built
model would pure
mathematical see im know people
astrophysics enough
embarrassing historical example
chasing know elegance kepler kepler
im saying look kepler
think genius kepler
platonic solid idea right
he got pyramid cube
rejected based
data yes 16 first
thought universe beautiful
divine perfect solid
perfect planet universe
must connection spent 10
year looking yeah
rejected
law planetary motion
indicative beautiful thing
newton law gravitation
inverse square law
there beauty underlying
scrap beauty
presumed would thats
step lightly someone say
beautiful idea yeah okay
let hear true
think one great
mystery um
historically einstein theory general
relativity another example
quest simplicity beauty
elegance judgment right
human judgment led
precise model way nature
work given cern
large hyron collider
lhc discovered higs boson
discover particle presumably
keep sort upgrading
system lhc compared
ever
ever greater force bust
particle see whats lurking
cant increase energy lhc
easily even easily
cant really would
major change machine
socalled high
luminosity upgrade mean
collide proton together
thing um win
statistic partical physic
quantum mechanic thing
happen statistically know
one dont know number
one 10 billion collision youll
produce something like interesting
higs less um
giving
collision give
chance discover new particle
give particle like
higs boson explore get higs
particle however many collision
thats kind rare
collision youll get higs yeah
improve statistic hell
higs yeah want know
could reaction
thats even rarer manifest
higs sample wasnt large
enough would never go yes
wouldnt see made one
thing one particle know one
whatever higs prime whatever
made one
wouldnt see made one
superhero nemesis im higs prime
know ive come toy way
look thing zed prime
zos look z prime
signature extra
dimension universe way
look stuff point
something rare
wont really see
make one two need
make hundred thousand whatever
see yeah like
many people live city
stumble someone who
seven foot tall yeah thats statistic
statistically yeah need
possibly million yeah
upgrade upgrade
upgrade
detector camera use
well machine okay kept
hole ground yeah yeah
dont want dig another one
change magnet around
expensive hole
go one country
contain intland france
switzerland wow okay yeah
france actually oh didnt know
little bit switzerland okay
thats one thing
thing higs weve discovered
question still remains
simplest one standard
model higs called something
complicated behave
analogy planetary science
would yeah discovered moon
go great would like
know moon dont want
say weve discovered moon
dot thats fine said theyre
interest want characterize
whatever way need
lot observe
exciting
challenging think
first time probably true say
particle physic dont know
there anything else around
corner
bad know also good
suppose science mean
ultimately neither bad good
way nature thats thats
trigger whatever next round
physic complete yeah know
get pe get people show
say there nothing left physic
discover well show
every decad utterly wrong
theyre even
worth mean know there tremendous
progress exciting
time fundamental physic mhm
moment uh particle physic
particle physic said
gravitational
astronomy exploration
force gravity black hole quantum
information related quantum
computing also stuff
utterly fascinating there
really interesting read stuff
day dont fully understand
actually um progress
string theory interesting
decide linking seems
linking one great
mystery socalled
cosmological constant fact
observed universe
accelerating expansion nobel
prize given observation
understanding yes
friend mine way didnt
believe didnt believe
saw wasnt air
idea looking light
supernova super im im paper
briyan schmidt yeah im like
minor author uh scroll
like name super
noa yeah
analysis high red ship supern noi
yeah totally enjoyed work
obviously went made
entire sort yeah branch career
there remarkable idea
come
einstein theory idea
kind
energy universe let say
thing whatever dont
know something make
universe rate space
stretch increase uh
thats observed one
great mystery
think smallest number
physic something
like 10 minus 122 something
appropriate unit right
absolutely ridiculously
tiny tiny tiny tiny thing thats causing
rate expansion um
zero question becomes
tiny tiny
zero yeah yeah
even slightly bigger wouldnt
universe would
blown apart seems unusual
saw week day
actually there research
thats linking
framework string theory uh
theory uh matter
there kind idea
fix get prediction
um dark matter
turn extra
dimension graviton extra
dimension thing quite
quite interesting think
interesting
area string theory progress
made quite remarkably string
theorist need fuller better
inventory particle example
still looking gravit
still looking know every
shake stick there
physicist proposing hypothetical
particle explain dark matter
explain wouldnt cool dark
matter related graviton
field
heard day sounded
interesting show
go back
lhc um higs particle
said um expected would say
particle physicist expected would
particle discovered there
particular experiment yeah lc
there particular theory
motivated string theory long
time ago called super symmetry
property universe
around many decade
came initially
either string theory
got incorporated
cant remember historically way
came um
essentially predicts
double number particle
see fundamental particle
energy would
great candidate dark matter
way astrophysical
discovery say suppose
one one sentence description
dark matter see
universe there far much matter
universe see see
would put differently yeah would
say there far dark matter
dark gravity well say matter
dont know dont know
well true see
gravitational inter dark gravity
yeah dont see otherwise get
newspaper headline say oh uh must
abandon idea dark matter well
matter still okay
misnamed yes see mean
mean thats cool newspaper
way would headline like
go usually
football player im
board newspaper yeah im
saying dont know
business calling matter
thing say though dark
gravity best sound cool
build model build model
true best model fit
data way
gravit galaxy rotate
collide way
gravity galaxy kind lens light
thing also cosmic
microwave background radiation
oldest light universe
worked ripple
sound wave went early
universe put
together fit
light lsh particle
interact light interacts weakly
would another category
particle particle soup yeah
gravity doesnt interact
electromagnetically weakly
right
thats model though youre right
thats model kind would
said baseline model people
assume dont problem
anything happens
model get shown cant true
people oh dark matter
there still dark
measurement universe
misnamed yeah agree measurement
galaxy spin round fast
fast way
collide there quite
lot independent measurement
thing tell gra mean
real particle think
physicist would say quantum
mechanic requires base
base
theory think reason im careful
people would
say general relativity thing
space time real thing
think generally people
would say quantum mechanic
underlining would
interaction word
quantum physic foundational yeah
universe way even general
relativity would yeah
talk later idea
space time space time emerge
quantum theory fashionable
moment partly study
black hole could talk
given
say people
watching listening um
would picture electromagnetic
force particle physic know
put like charge together
repel whats
happening bring magnet
together right repel
everybody know north pole
together repel whats
happening particle physic term
picture exchange
photon particle light go
one particle
essentially carry force thats
thats particle physicist would
picture force force
successfully applied gravity
thats point
give resonant
strong suppose im trying find
right word think thats
said conviction almost
dont know physicist would
disagree cant fold
quantum world dont
really right start looking
graviton youre going say
graviton mediating particle
yes way photon
med particle thats um think
dont think youd find anyone
would disagree statement okay
although dont think would
although true say
gravity weak
thing say tremendously weak
compared three force
nature electrom magnetism
one tell people youve surely
done class say weak
gravity well pick something
floor wish earth
exactly yeah yeah whole earth
pulling ball pick
kick kick
youre using electromagnetism thats
whats happening muscle
thing
electromagnetic force completely
destroys said gravitational
force um gravity additive
add universe
dominant force cosmic
distance scale thats point
gravity here calculation havent
verified sounded legit uh
verifiable never lazy
uh take like space
shuttle glory day take
one remove electron one cubic
centimeter nose main tank
take electron put
base launchpad could
would able launch
attraction electron
base launch pad net
positive charge top right yeah
enough prevent launching yeah
thats cool idea could see
would yeah yeah actually would yeah
borrow whole probably yeah
realistic experiment get
sense force involved yeah
thats really nice okay gravity
weak somehow bail
problem well mean
cant dont experimental access
okay weak
agree whereas experimental
access photon yeah unless could
potentially access
extra dimension universe
configured right way
physicist always throwing extra
dimension whenever need know
interesting though
string theory work 10 dimension
10 dimension mathematically
thats um interesting observation
right dont dont dont
background authentic drink
theory skeptic know physicist
dont yeah think
mean depends think depends
mean string theory mean
go back know
decade talk brian green
example started working
area would he friend star
talk onest several time
would um great elegant
universe beautiful description
string theory think
idea initially hope
youd theory could write
theory everything
would predict universe see
go home done
think thats gone idea
basic idea
mean called string theory
particle point likee
string like little string
little loop idea
think still foundation
modern theoretical physic area
got much complicated
much harder think
initial idea could predict
everything one number maybe
gone away one simple equation one
line tremendous progress
made string theory
gone away become
complicated would say well thanks
catching
conference youre giving talk
black hole yeah
recent announcement biggest jet
black hole ever discovered ever yeah
ever uh asked
press simply said there always
biggest jet universe
one a380 okay airb a380
fantastic sell
significance huge jet
biggest one unless there
interesting physic thats coming
area share phd
student who working area
theoretical
quantum information way
information behaves inside outside
black hole happens thing
fall um term
astrophysical work go back
know long ago didnt really
observation uh thing
behave vicinity black hole
would put box weve
got several observation weve got
radio telescope observation
event horizon collaboration
shown u magnetic field work
example around black
hole milky way weve got
jet giving access
magnetic structure presumably way
thank putting
context understand
broadens astrophysical data set yeah
sharpen hypothesis whats
going yeah theyre hard
thing observe course
cant observe interior
inside thing called event
horizon
observe way material
behaves vicinity
remarkable thing weve
able last year
watch collide see
ripple fabric universe
come detect ripple
thing allowing u
probe object worth
remembering present
described um nonspinning one
described fully work carl
swell
1916 month einstein
published theory general
relativity didnt know time
mathematical descrip
description found describes
space time distorted
presence star nonspinning star
kind important um
fully describe black hole isnt
spinning remember correctly uh would
die first world war dont think
made war died
1916 shortly action
action okay think died
dis disease
russian front okay yeah war
related think would
argue war related uh yeah weve got
know century
mathematical foundation yeah
go forward data
data
take another 50 year way
someone work look like
spinning one roy kerr
famous ker solution two
solution theyre einstein
theory sense um
describe black ho um observing
something havent
able till recently
multiwave length well yeah
radio observation
gravitational wave observation ill
ill little kinder well
way thing
said right start science
yes idea building theory
really
fundamentally testing
theory yeah talk
theoretical object jack black
hole really rich
theoretically ultimately youve got
make observation thats
jet seeing material
behaves give access
magnetic field thing
spinning thats
important hey star talk fan dont
know know audio
version podcast actually post
week advance video version
get spotify apple
podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk let talk
work public said
earlier
share commitment binan
declared duty bring science
public dont talk
talk walk walk
spillage everywhere know get
given tour public tour
australia across europe uh
remember correctly youre coming back
united state next spring give
tour across country yeah yeah
tour um thats going
quite long time wasnt meant
really weve ended
playing 400000 people across
world tour wait wait wait
youre musician say playing
get vocabulary im look im rock
roll basically always
five truck two tour
bus brilliant im reliving
life see version
came city yeah
early
yeah screen
interlock whole stage
yeah early iteration
changed lot
laid rest tour develop
another one wanted bring back
form
radically different
celebrating universe
public also
morphed there version
symphony orchestra
great fun sydney offer
house actually initially um last year
big orchestra 90
piece symphony orchestra
music chose
reason way slight digression
part tour classical
music big part tour
start caluss fifth symphony third
movement
conductor friend mine called daniel
harding said
stanley cubric used 2001
joke like used
immediately said seus fifth symphony
written 19 uh 15
year general relativity
published basis almost
every science fiction theme youve ever
heard hear beautiful uh
idea
ive always strongly believed
came mind
tour talking
deeper philosophical question
raised cosmology say
right start mean
live finite fragile life
infinite eternal universe right
say course
dont know answer
uplift people depress well
know moment
contemplate scale universe
say dont know whether
infinite dont know whether
eternal right could well
infinite eternal purpose
kind right human human
scale yeah immediately
contemplate size scale
universe ask question
place quite vividly
mean live little finite fragile
life think try approach
question realize
realize light
shine problem science
necessary bright vivid light
cast well delineated shadow
given u obviously
framework within operate
light
realize mara example use
mara classical concert mara
thought lot mean
live finite fragile life gave
eloquent answer many eloquent
answer symphony
asked way uh
trying say whats
answer said well could
say would wouldnt written
music good answer music
love music
composer chose part
tour
going ne coming year ne next
april 2025 um theyre music
composer chosen
explored question gave
eloquent answer
add think
philosophical exploration
question raised sign
whats name tour called
horizon horizon thats easy enough
remember okay cool there
lot black hole well
say exploration
idea find black horizon
horizon yes
also life universe
origin evolution life speculation
could talk speculation
many civilization might
guest well thing life
universe youve done many many uh tv
series
recently one solar
system yeah search life
main theme well yeah saw
speak last week europa clipper
spacecraft launched yes way
europa entire show devoted
visited jet
propulsion lab saw felt
excitement everyone great
isnt first spacecraft ive
seen major spacecraft built
saw clipper thing
scale thing
largest spacecraft isnt thats ever
sent well add
massive here may
there another important fact solar
panel gotten efficient
day back going explore
beyond asteroid belt couldnt
use solar panel intensity
sun wasnt high enough one
deployable large solar panel
thatll help along without
rely entirely nuclear
decay pl
yeah huge spacecraft
point europa jupiter moon
prime candidate habitable
world know almost
certainly im always people
know work mission say dont say
know almost sure there
saltwater ocean surface
think pretty indisputable
pretty sure yeah whatever
skepticism would
glal ocean yeah
difficult thats
many measurement made amonia mean
there know water molecule
rare yeah look like salt water
yeah lot
comparative planetology
arctic freeze
chunk ice break
refreeze readjust
compare image youd think
looking frozen arctic yeah
yeah look there
water ocean
ocean earth
combined geologically active
question ice crack
move surface
fascinating mission thats europa
mar course probably
spoken many time podcast
um enceladus another one saturn
moon even even pluto even
one see plume geyser
guess yeah yeah right sun
angle see took
picture must must right
right right yeah also there
measurement cassini
particle jet water
consistent hydrothermal vent
activity floor hydrothermal
vent one plausible
candidate origin life
earth yes seem everything
one thing think europa got
arguably nowhere else look
like ocean many
billion year thats
baseline scenario evolve life
less time earth yeah
yeah present 38 billion year ago
38 yeah yeah four
half billion year old right yes
look like habitat
thats stable think
cant cl fact know
taught took half
billion year earth get life going
able revise number
early earth
period heavy bombardment
fair start clock
still getting slammed know still
accreting leftover rock solar
system temperature surface
earth high enough prevent
complex molecule give u chance
please period bombardment
subside earth surface cool start
clock 100 100
million year yeah yeah thats like
yeah one reason
think think speak many
biologist would say might
suggest given right condition
whatever origin life
there reasonable probability given
right condition happened
quickly right
thats thats definitive
sense certainly tempting go
find
interesting though ask
okay life get complex
single cell youre youre
dont think there evidence
fossil record back beyond 600
million year ago took yeah
single cell creature three
billion year yeah plus seems
think people think
problem honest
search life planet
really looking single cell
organism well would would
remarkable see anything complex
well remarkable see single
cell
know especially biologically
different really show
got different origin
worth saying mar material
exchanged earth mar
obvious yeah could
make point series
right people
find series streaming
presume yeah yeah weve got new one
moment actually thats
im saying solar system
appear apple suppose
point place yeah mean
moment bbc um
streaming bbc
head around world one
coolest thing think europa
habitat
potential habitat requires jupiter
heating liquid
theing around big
also seems require well requires
moon iio ganim keep
orbital resonance keep
feeding energy
gravitational field family affair
also might need
material volcano io
surface europa might
provide call
oxidant right life
youre saying io
badly stressed one big volcano
one big volcano th spews
volcanic substance yeah faster
escape velocity apparently
go land eur
go pathway intersect
moon europa included
billion year
chemistry get iradi help
chemistry yeah one
theory ive spoken
people clip emission said
thats part battery life
chemistry life cant remember
said said life someone
said life electron looking
place land thats life
one way see life
electron moving around mean
need chemistry
electron looking
place land well thats thats whatt
id rather dust wind whatever
find
wonderful youve got
habitat system
said comparative planetology
mentioned earlier also true
earth isnt cant understand
earth without understanding system
solar system need understand
moon stabilizes spin
axis need understand
course sun way interacts
earth im year
senior dont know would
remember defitely era
one thinking caring
moon yeah solar system
know dead moon
orbiting u oddly large fine let
go look planet yeah every
mission planet
looked shoulder found
moon way geologic
diversity anything finding
planet know found
interesting mean
school pre
voyage well voyage im pre voyager
voyager turned moon world
yeah thats happened yeah yeah
idea habitable zone
solar system zone
within rocky planet
orbiting everythings right
atmosphere right could
condition support life
surface liquid water let say
turn needlessly
limiting well exactly
say well mar earth venus solar
system thats find reh
habitable zone around gas giant
said great
discovery vo voyager would say yeah
began voyager really sure yeah
19 early 1980s right im
im delighted even particle
physicist get also platform
solar system
name recognition always thats
said started astrophysics
really wanted astronomer
ive always ive ive got
telescope confess safe
space ended particle
physic almost
astrophysics thats
thought want astronomer
university manchester jodell
bank radio telescope example
one big radio telescope
world still wasnt one
discovered first pulsar
uh cambridge cd cd j discovered
something else mean george bank
one first
pine one pioneering
lot work work camp
pulsar uh uh
thought id astronomer
telescope thats
sit accept
club even though drifted
particle physic space expiration
thats
university got interested
mathematics didnt think
good mathematics school uh
found bit practice
enjoyed ended really
getting theoretical physic
went way thats
ended partical physic really
course ive every every
opportunity get seem drift back
universe cool know
dont want brag universe
black hole actually
intersect absolutely particle
physic general
relativity astronomy big bang
course yeah yeah yeah yeah
particle physic hat
neutrino thought
theyre sort fully understood
solved nutrino problem sun
nobel prize given uh
anything left discover
elusive particle belongs
say tree life
particle tree life yeah mean
neutrino fascinating thing
theyre theyre
almost massless quite
matter ring bell know
like thats thing
science isnt go
unusually light maybe isnt maybe
thing unusually heavy
telling u something
neutrino hard
interact give
belief set
particle might exist dont
interact neutrino
specie well interact
weak force interact thats
u thats little world right
symmetric particle
force mediate
correct would um
sort extension standard model
particle physic
force change thing
thing different force
far know far zoo
discovered described
three force um strong
nuclear force weak nuclear force
electromagnetism hanging
weve discussed gravity
really different framework
moment coral steve ber elevator
one day
uh know physicist im telling
im telling audience particle
physicist one great yeah
went high school let allow
add one wi nobel laurates
high school
said live
night given many particle
come there like lost count
mean
universe said
many particle
many law
describe yeah
yeah thought damn good
answer yeah he remember steven weber
good answer think im right
quoting saying almost
wish black hole didnt exist
theyre perplexing would
easier kind joking
course physicist love mystery
almost like
difficult bizarre maybe nature
doesnt make oh got see see
he he invoking human limitation
capacity kind joke
saying thing baffling
weird way id rather
werent know say
old age
getting tired solving universe
joking still trying
explore neutrino understand
there new nutrino experiment
came online mean
several mean mean
fundamental question seem
reason interested
interested
theyre three 12 fundamental
particle right made
basically three particle thats u
electron proton neutron uh well
proton neutron made
quark oh okay quark let let
start made atom
start made atom
at greek mean indivisible yeah
thats word mean yeah
remarkable way say
greek 2000 year ago uh
discovered structure
atom 20th century ad
existed well yeah debate
turn 20th century one
debate science
thing atom yeah incredible
incredible yeah yeah yeah einstein
indeed 1905 one famous paper
brownie motion one
three famous paper year one
one special relativity
one got nobel
prize photo electric effect
third one einstein
retroactively give like dozen
nobel prize astonishing didnt
get nobel prize relativity
got basically foundation
quantum mechanic yeah discovered
matter made atom
quickly discover
atom electron initially
almost solar system like model
nucleus dense nucleus
electron going around
discover nucleus made
proton neutron thats 1930s
way orbit model still
symbol atom yeah know yeah
atomic classic know
thats adam look nothing like
quantum mechanic
come tell cant
charged particle moving around
vicinity charged
particle radiate energy away
wouldnt stable known
course um find
nucleus made prot neutron
said neutron 1930s
discovery long ago im
amazed much know
centennial decade discovery
quantum physic back
1920s whole 1920s done
discovered new
thats crazy yeah almost
living living memory
people okay let get
back fundamental particle
discovered proton
neutron made quark quark
far tell point
like object theyre fundamental
wont far tell
experimentally photon
electron well let matter
particle
quark make proton neutron
proton two ups
neutron two down got
two quark per energy
stratum correct well
discovered
nice thing
electron said
quark thing called
electron
neutrino talked
neos four fundamental
particle anything know care
four yep thats
construct
particle
recip four
thats there four
mediate
interaction right okay
also think carried
particle said photon
partic electromagnetic force
w z boson weak
nuclear force gluon
strong nuclear force stick
quark name gluon gl okay
thats seems except
two copy identical
except theyre massive
there there str charm
strange quark muon
neutrino thats another family thats
nothing thats next level
energy theyre massive massive
okay okay charm
strange muan muno
another one yeah
bottom top sometimes called
beauty truth depending
want quark
toa neutrino thats
far tell
4812 fundamental particle
antimatter counterpart yeah
antimatter counterpart
dont know
three experimentally
proven really small
caveat three generation
three family thing
reason
three could five 10 dont
know must something
underlying look like periodic
table remember go back men
mendal periodic table
understand pattern
chemical property
element understand
know everythings made atom
yeah mean chemist arranged
didnt understanding
quantum physic well well need
know structure need know
there nucleus there know
hydrogen got one electron helium
got two carbon get
far yeah understand
chemistry understand pattern
understand building block
okay dont know pattern
clearly telling u
building block
underlying theory dont know
one great mystery
thats zoo
particle know there
higs clear
attacked steven weinberg elevator
uh particle identity
referencing different combination
different quirk yeah come together
yeah like said
f50s people discovering
thing theyre different
combination ups down
strange charm bottom
know exist
universe theyre made
fundamental basically
thing proton neutron
theyre kind analogous atom
way theyre thing theyre quite
big thing particle physic
internal structure
one yeah one thing
involved back
hamburg year ago
mapping structure proton
saying
proton work maing
interior structure proton
need needed lhc
need collide proton
together detailed
map like call structure
function theyre map
proton well
thank pleasure joining
always love talking
like kindred spirit
world wish great success
spring tour go beyond
united state world tour
world tour weve dont
know 20 30 country said
probably approaching half
million people whove come okay
thats
end really one
wanted bring back
changed much could started
state actually proto
form ive loved
much wanted
bring like idea
science talk given
truck unload
staging pro proper rock
roll got ries ive got everything
tor tshirt
yeah oh yeah right
brought one one shirt oh
god oh weve got everything weve
done many many show many
150 200 dont fit one
tshirt got different tshirts
different region world
physic take world uh good
brian thanks show
exclusive conversation
good friend brian cox
uk who coming
stateside tour going
look solar system
rand yeah bbc many
many episode five five episode
well look forward right
star talk im host neil
degrass tyson always keep looking
music
