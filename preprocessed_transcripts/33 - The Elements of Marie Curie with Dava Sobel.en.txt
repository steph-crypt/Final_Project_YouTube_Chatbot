know read title
subtitle book say aint
buying who going care
didnt think anybody would buy yeah
give buy subtitle
true story lone genius solved
greatest scientific problem
time oh im buying book wa wait
wait kidding thats thats
like scientific tel nolla well know
titled longitude longitude
thats im saying might
lost thats im saying
people still ask whats
really hilarious wouldnt
utter man name one
heard uh harrison john

thank
thank uh weve got
yet another
book setting straight okay
let uh marie curri oh okay
everyone wait wait okay im
going read subtitle
want compliment yet
another subtitle go give
u marie cirrus glow radium
lit path woman science oh see
youre showing youre
showing glow radium glow
radium thats pretty wild yeah yeah
like see
cuz right didnt discover
radium right discovered radium
get whole sry get whole
thing im trying remember oh
remember ponum oh
god actually first one yeah
cant name know right
curium right didnt name
curium came
later yeah first radioactive
element radium well uranium
first one oh sure sure one
worked discovered
first one ponum many element
discover two ponum
radium okay right later
would name element honor
curium cuum gotcha
marie curri land lap uh
almost religious experience
course writing glass
universe story
woman
kept finding surprised
done finally
admit
embarrassingly low
expectation
even though im woman
mother scientist
reason true um reason
respectful picked
negative attitude woman
air man bias
definitely stunned
several astronomer
fact check book one
alyssa goodman
harvard
apologized right away said im
really focusing description
astrophysics im
gobsmacked woman
harvard know name
always thought something cute
quaint never realized
science kind misogyny
low opinion woman science
widespread
insidious made want tell
story woman science
editor immediately suggested marie
cury said everybody
know dont
anything new say
wouldnt want regurgitate fact
asked review book
called woman element
woman chemist 30
reading profile
woman six seven direct
connection marie cury
interesting like little
network got touch cury
museum paris record
45 woman worked
wow something knew
nobody knew madam fury
like harpo studio
science
oprah gave access
record um
actually book published uh
little little sketch woman
alphabetical order
biographical
detail reference paper
written
stable woman working mar
laboratory right 45 woman 45 man thats
phenomenal mean
even get number

french right
madame course go paris
go university
warsaw born woman
allowed attend university wow yeah
yeah
talking talking late
1800s yeah yeah first woman ever

really
phenomenon magnet woman
scientist oh course oh cool yeah
woman poland werent
allowed go school
like headed paris
study marie norway didnt want
undervalue value
visibility yes ambition
others oh gosh whereas think woman
always interested science
found way participate science
first one really
charge laboratory

multiple way
ingest cosmic star talk
okay
today people ask name famous
female scientist scientist
name marie curri sad
truth okay youre helping
matter published book
marie c guilty
char maybe rest woman
story
highlighted among yes oh well yes
thats also part
book book oh
woman
legacy go yeah uh
lifetime came
collaborated
published taught
course inspiring student
class even taught
university taught
teacher training school woman
taught physic wow
field shared nobel
prize physic pierre
1903 1903
19011 awarded nobel
committee awarded nobel prize
chemistry wow alone
didnt share anyone right yeah
nobel prize shared thank thank
goodness
mean hate cynical
share nobel prize husband
husband also share name
name people going
automatically uh fall bias
well clearly assistant
work happened even
though second nobel prize even
though really rough woman
let tell thats thats
glad second one erase
stigma might attached
second one right yes
know still still got said
assistant oh man
reason took work
dissertation project got
really interesting pierre quit
work yeah
like man okay didnt say im
saying good friend uh
british physicist hertha aerton
also married physicist
intentionally worked different thing
one could say hera
husband assistant assistant
wow uh highlight science
came lab
brilliance well
radioactivity word
new phenomenon thats got
interested xrays
discovered
1895 huge
interest thousand paper xrays got
got first nobel prize
physic willin 1900 discovery
xrays unfortunate name
bham bilham r fact
one call xrays everybody else
call r right didnt know
im sorry got
rankin
back appears wrist
fractured yeah thats doesnt
work know got xrays
dont know sound great
wilham call called
xrays next year beckel
france beel
know thats good name
multicultural thats good one
curious xrays
wanted
see uh maybe effect
fluorescence phosphorescence
noticed experimenting
uranium
crystal something else coming
uranium
xrays
um got interested
called uranic
ray everybody else
interested
xrays nobody picked
uranic ray madame cury looking
thesis topic thought thats
thatll good
interesting husband
inventor instrument scientific
instrument scientific instrument
way measure strength
uranic
ray instrument could
pick seemed perfect
soon started
testing element see
anything else emitted uran uranic
ray found thorium also
name know uh god
bifrost thor thor yeah huge
fun history culture mythology
people embedded periodic
table go thorium
testing uranium ore got
reading far higher either
uranium thorium oh
concluded unknown
element
yet undiscovered element
could discover basis
radioactivity word
say earlier whatever
ingredient found
uranium yeah thats pretty wild
inferred existence exactly
pure uranium wouldnt
already tested knew
strength much much
higher first retested everything
make sure sure didnt make
mistake said
new element wow
part excitement period
periodic table work
progress still
gap point moreap
still increasing high end uh
making bigger fatter element
there hypothesized place
element highly unstable
there hypothesized place based
equation atomic nucleus
stability called think
there island stability
element make
element theyre theyll permanent
theyre wont decay like
element
there hunt island
stability yeah still
still working table everything
youre talking filling gap
filling gap right
oh yeah right lot
gap
course breaking
ore isolate new element
realized two different one
first one identified
polonium named poland
right
yes yeah
fiercely polish yeah uh yeah mhm
originally intended get
educated paris go back
poland teach uplift
country people right uh
fell love colleague thought
might helpful
work fell love neither
expected
line im wrote one
family member
grief grief
remain forever ever par
deeply love wow today would
emoji lost ability
communicate want say could
really write scientific paper
clear yeah marvel
clarity way wife would
leave plane ticket
paris
music
right much less secret know im
saying plane ticket shes like
listen man im sorry didnt
work good
exactly im im im delighted take
much granted modern time
chart box front
chemistry class complete yeah
forever like like
endowed universe
there hard work make
happen tell one
understands time
radioactivity harm healthy tissue
give backstory
well youd think would figured
right away burn
hand carried
vial stuff pocket got
burn body immediately
drew attention medical doctor
saw material treatment
cancer several decade radium
cure cancer tumor
would would attack cell
tumor exactly radiating
cell tumor exactly wow would
would drop radi radium
tumor would
changed time first two
patient two woman breast cancer
actually brought cu
laboratory wow somebody
thought even
consider right harm
associated obviously
much good
interesting find
radioactivity also cause
cancer well think real big moment
1920s um dial
painter young woman
painting number glowinthedark
watch instrument using paint
actually contained radium right
told put paintbrush
lip get nice point
tip yes destroyed jaw
died good teeth fell
yeah horrible thats terrible
horrible course madame curri
never advocated paint full radium
yeah think
think amazing
there something thats glowing
yeah must
stupify yeah appealed
marie pierre beginning
would try break
ore theyd different
dish didnt
know first night
would glow isnt
really radium right even
paint radium shoot alpha
particle excites
ingredient paint thats
thats
render
visible pivotal moment
history science absolutely physic
chemistry yeah absolutely
moment
physic chemistry really meet meet
meet society fundamental way would
say concept
radioactivity value dating
thing age began
marie c fair credit give
yes wasnt work
people lab oh including
woman okay something
radioactive certain amount
substance sample
radioactive changing identity
becoming another element right right
alchemical isnt look
look big
problem first changing one element
another even possible right
cuz wed already given alchemy
exactly right know rate
changing know
much started youll know
old sample right long
yeah oh gosh
useful especially
geologist yeah yes age earth
determined wake
discovery cool much older
anybody older 6000000
year think think thats
funny yeah tell second
nobel prize cited
morning chemistry specifically
discovery new element
isolation radium
recently managed
element existed tiny quantity
ton ore would get
fraction gram know big
much gram weighs um big
cracker
dont know much grand
hardly anything
130th 1 oun 130th ounce yeah

earth always keep looking tell
daughter oh whats dad
two daughter
older girl much like father
marie always dreamed would
become scientist
also nobel prize chemistry wow
dam talk bloodline right
yeah
daughter nobel prize 1935
husband found
way create oh oh husband
there another husband
repeated story
married lab partner worked together
wow made tremendous
discovery shared nobel prize
look become
mother
discover discovered way make
artificial radio element
big advantage natural radioactive
element would decay
something non radioactive immediately
could make
safer wow important medicine
medicine exactly exactly cu dont
really want using radium treat
cancer thats fascinating w yeah
element created equal oh
decay faster others right yeah
lethality harm
factor drop exponentially yeah
needed peak
right yeah there fact
depending long need
treatment pull one
shelf right radioactive
profile absolutely right right shes
creating idea foundation
whatever medical instrument would
later built wow service
human health people got
nobel prize discovery
basically would call go
youre
welcome science build
yeah yes yes thats want talk
love affair time
second nobel prize husband
gone he deceased yes five five
year gone understand
highly written medium affair
married man
remembering correctly yes okay
today dont know important
would anybody late
s okay early
1910s information received
differently shes celebrity
everyone going care sex
life okay right thats
thats go
matter nobel committee
mattered everyone
vilified called home wer
foreigner married man
child word got
got wake highly
important physic meeting
top physicist world invited
attend
woman room come
albert einstein ernest
rutherford people youve heard
ruford discovered nucleus
atom heavy
hitter heavy big time shes vilified
cheating husband vilified
right right victim oh he victim
oh uh harlot
scientist course know shes
foreigner shes recently
tried gain election academy
science people get
jingoistic shes foreigner right shes
shes home wer man married kid
right he victim happened
meeting happened
commit meeting
already einstein wrote
outraged pinpointed
way
said he sorry rabble
concerning thought
highly yeah sound see

think didnt
want med circ whole
right circus would unfold
right wouldnt asking
would would change
mood ceremony ceremony
offered first
come told one
belief lie
changed mind asked
come
said fail see connection

cury yes thereve play
movie yeah said
different story well see happens
yeah yeah yeah okay remember
mural course
huge mosaic front entrance
bronx high school science
walk every single day
biblical scale
posturing character
every single character
mathematician scientist engineer
one marie curri
prominently featured shes
woman yeah shes looking
test tube something chemical
got like galileo figure newton
motep architect ancient egypt uh
folk walk every
day say
yeah one day im gonna mirror
cool thats thats thats
fantastic seems everything
marie curri touched around
lab might still radioactive today yes
true im sure okay
note clothing
effect yeah radium halflife
1600 year oh well
thats yeah 1600 year remind
people halflife whatever
much radium today 1600 year
half much right
1600 year half half
3200 year 14
whats sitting front right
clearly thats dead
die died plastic
anemia body could longer
create red blood cell partly
radioactivity exposure also xray
exposure world war
outfitted van xray equipment
drove front going
first time battle wound
could xrayed created
mobile xray unit wow
instantly obvious value
xrays discovered
even argue
doctor never seen
still relatively new okay
created car
equipment people
quickly convinced willing
something permanent wherever
field hospital set
course created six week course
xray electricity human anatomy
trained 150 french woman
work wow every exray technician owes
yes debt created
job yes well
coming
medical rank feeling
crisis lot
woman want help
woman front tell
yeah tell need
know go
amazing learn uh maria
cury like say radio
activity say um short
list short list theyre like
radioactivity nobel prize woman
scientist moving know like
thats mean im absolutely
gob smacked accomplishment
woman shes responsible
started book
pandemic happened didnt get go
paris discovered
everything madam cury
digitized personal notebook
touching grief
journal kept year
husband death spoke
read whole thing online
access digital record
didnt expose
might residual radium well
couldnt even grief going
paris know
um settle
fascinated wealth
material read weekly
publication academy science
back century easy yeah
get notebook yes okay
h sold free
free get
french reading thing oh
french oh okay yeah
course yeah yeah unless
english really bad french accent
im
screwed frenchman bad accent
really well bet bet always
give cigarette thats
cigarette okay french law
want
arrested soon forget perhaps
never knew worse yet suppressed
contribution many people many
scientist
engineer seeker cosmic truth
laboratory sky anywhere
number people represented
population
huge yet ever read
somehow u prone think
information knowledge discovery
somehow handed u high
tablet sky hard
work scientist committed
done often without reward
reward act discovery
knowledge universe
knowable frontier
moving frontier contributed
base knowledge call
science marie curri among others
woman lab
lab yet hear
davis soel hasnt written
yet know many
lab lurk ignorance u get
full appreciation foundation
take granted modern
science cosmic perspective
dava first ever start talk guest
want come back every book
write want write another
one
moment need incentive back
start write another damn book got
okay got thanks
show chuck good man always
pleasure right star
talk inaugural guest returning
coming back u 600th
episode started episode
number one dava soel wow thanks
coming back wow neil tyson
