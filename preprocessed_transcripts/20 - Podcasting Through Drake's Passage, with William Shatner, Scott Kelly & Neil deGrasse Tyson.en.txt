loved combine
everybody love like pot
perie uh oh didnt know yeah
nasa done
think say na done
thats get space
shuttle amalgam idea stapled

got wing jet nozzle
back seems wherever
ought able choose let
go someplace new fact thats
film
armageddon yes real life
start approach okay
got land thats thats one
reason
armageddon violated known law
physic per minute film
ever made uh tell
space shuttle meant
job fun versatile looked
job get orbit
thats wasnt job oh
please space shuttle one
uh diverse
spacecraft weve ever built probably
lifetime
one serious limitation heavy
doesnt carry enough fuel get
low earth orbit launch
people la launch cargo build
thing built international space
station science
laboratory space walk
cargo bay huge far
tell launched
deployed hubble space telescope
favorite favorite size analog
hubble telescope
size greyhound bus mean
could lower greyhound bus
payload shuttle yeah something
weighed 50000 pound whereas
soy use use
counter example russian russian
soyou spacecraft really designed
launch three people small
amount cargo thats
well doesnt much
youve
craft twice
twice yeah maybe
soos complex
shuttle orbiter
solid rocket booster soy
best safety record
space rocket theyve two fatal
inlight accident like space
shuttle less people okay uh similar
