essentially last couple year
since mua mua weve discovered
seven object within solar system
wouldnt conundrum
object never detected
yes class object weve
never seen yes wouldnt filled
thing dont make sense
dont make sense maybe
object solar
system thing
never noticed
detect comet
see commentary tale hence
dark comet yes
get
star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist got
chuck nice chuck whats neil
right man hear youre working
standup special yes trying
sell right youre
done done youre amazon
netflix hi
okay well good luck yeah
thanks good luck know
going talk today whats
dark comet
oo sound like
marvel movie im dark comet dark comet
dark comet ive seen term
dont know define okay
cuz specialty like galaxy
cosmology like going
solar small comet yeah
cant bothered comet
dark com world expert
subject daryl seligman daryl
welcome star talk hey thank
yeah
assistant professor michigan state
university yeah well starting next year
ill assistant professor right
im nsf fellow oh thats
phd first uh 10e track job
yes exactly he brand new wow look
birth national
science foundation birth look
national science foundation
whats called postdoctoral
fellowship get phd
okay uh money whatever
hell want like freedom
wouldnt otherwise
immediately went right academia
dar title thesis
remember barely
remember title thesis
there lot word subtitle
comment well
actually interstellar object
interstellar object okay well let
start longest
presumed stuff flying
star thats right nobody ever
saw one occasionally youd
expect pay u visit yeah
least pas pas
thats mean could come
go weve looking
century yeah main topic
study something doesnt exist
yet oh well pretty lucky
third year
graduate student pure
fluid dynamic astrophysics
thirdyear graduate student amua
mua discovered clear
fluid astrophysicist
gas gas exactly okay
liquid gas fluid
physicist right right okay
mua mua anything
fluid dynamic well doesnt
much fluid dynamic
honest exciting
opportunity
kind dropped everything
else yes dropped everything
else started
working dont know
closely following back 2017
one exciting
time astronomy basically
thing got discovered
also moving super fast
observable couple week
groundbased telescope upwards
three four week would expect
moving fast coming
interstellar space yes would
expect moving fast
would faster anything else
planet moving
direction around sun amua
come coming totally
different direction look
like moving really fast compared
motion going
opposite direction okay
got got uh mua mua found
thing yes called mu
sound hawaiian think
discovered telescope hawaii
picked pan star
telescope hawaii funded
department defense theyre
looking near earth object okay
small kilometer scale object
k scale small knock
as exactly object
potentially hazardous
important find ample
time something uh theyre
going hit u exactly time kiss
as
good need enough time get
way seems
say pan star
expectation finding interstellar
object ability
regardless fair statement well
true think
originally designed pan star hoping
find interstellar object
last couple decade mean
know solar system ejected good
amount material interstellar
object much stretch
imagine planetary system
would also ejecting material
would see difference
see small body
come across night sky look
hyperbolic fact hadnt
seen trying put limit
number galaxy based
seeing hope
pan star would find one right
dont see certain amount
time say cant
number otherwise would
seen statistically yes exactly
said hyperbolic tell
mean cuz people
hyperbolic know mean different sense
word hyperbolic yes oh
flavor flave comic comic
knew knew hyperbolic
like yeah
boy came solar system
left never coming back
hyperbolic mean orbit
bound sun got everybody
else orbit bound
sun thats right either like
circle ellipse yes right exactly
comment see every
like haly right thats
bound sun thats see
every cuz theyre going
around coming back thats exactly h
comet like 1776 year
seen got
life aint living 152 cut
brother break
152 year old know
hypertension
damn saying yeah hyperbolic
would best evidence
member solar system
comic coming far
away time thats right
isnt asteroid
know comet kind
continuum comet asteroid
uh oh okay get
word
issue word
definition yeah thing
formed large distance sun
ice hasnt
evaporated away exactly year
eon yeah exactly comet
get close sun ice heat
sublimate producing dust tail
produce bright beautiful
commentary tale cant say evaporate
yeah cant right itates got use real
word course yes regular fol
evaporating yeah exactly
sublimate remind u sublimate
mean ice well
comet ice
transition straight gas form
straight straight away without melting
yeah call dry
ice oh okay smoke away
right youve never seen liquid dry ice
havent right go
right lady
gentleman coming stage go
right straight ice smoke
smoke yeah fact ice
tray freezer okay long
vacation come back ice cube
little yeah ever check
seen yeah see
shrink inside actual tr yeah
actually sublimating oh okay
keep going interrupted
distinguishing com
continuum asteroid comet go
right expected interstellar
object get ejected
planetary system likely
would formed large distance
lot ice wed
expect comet
form large distance theyre
strongly held gravity
host star yeah
knocked thats exactly right okay
form far distance
havent close enough
host star yeah get
double force going may ask
theyre forming large
distance host star
happens get kicked
theyre slingshot
hey im see im way yeah
thats great question
good question also dont know
answer stop asking guest question
cant answer chck likely
thing basically something
like deep space maneuver
spacecraft slingshot
planet something
big jupiter mean version
jupiter yeah version
jupiter something jupiter mass
around five astronomical unit
get small body get close
planet could get slungshot
jupiter like proxy sun
jupiter type act like like would
sun well mess oh
mess orbit thing
yeah like
get close jupiter start feeling
gravitational influence much
sun change
gotcha okay get get
get jupiter intervenes
intervenes right also presumably
given enough time star
system may get tugged star
happen wander close yes
thats exactly right yeah also
happen okay
thinking comet instead
asteroid mua mua every way
expected acted exact opposite
biggest thing cometary
tail whatsoever call
comet well initially
called comet uh made
mistake actually minor planet center
changed say
asteroid looked inactive
mean doesnt look like
comet doesnt look like
tail doesnt reveal fl thats
exactly right realized
trying get followup
observation hubble space
telescope spitzer space
telescope object
nongravitational acceleration
spitzer specializes infrared
remember correctly ex good good
want want combine different
tool toolkit observational
astronomer see many way
okay spitzer really great
like looking infed really
great comet science
reason use thing like
exoplanets see
typical cometary gas like co2 co
wouldnt able see
ground spitzer named lyman
spitzer oh okay former chair
astrophysics group princeton
university ah one
book show going say
sound like know
way keep interrupting okay
keep going go essentially
nongravitational acceleration
apparent dust coma important
point nongravitational
acceleration see first
mean object
look time position
sky figure
orbit realize
orbit could explained
sun gravitational influence
must additional force acting
measure mean
nongravitational thats mean
nongravitational measure
comet time mh
many comet nonra might
even slip call non
gravs non graph
measured thats happening
ice sublimate produce like
rocket type recoil effect okay every
jet little bitty jetty thing come
force operating
trajectory yes thats exactly right
alone unusual uncommon
alone uncommon thats didnt
fuzz thats right exactly
want fuzz youre
going nongravitational thats
right youre conundrum yes
another kind important point
also see
asteroid accelerating nong
gravitationally
nongravitational
acceleration example
caused solar pressure radiation
pressure theyre much much weaker
mu mu nongravitational acceleration
weird thing one
one dust coma
much stronger
could operating asteroid cuz
think asteroid many
dark would absorb sunlight
yes youre absorbing
momentum photon like solar
cil point oh yeah well
theem either case light
pressure acting great okay
nice conundrum way im
big reader history science
yeah wouldnt conundrum
object never
detected yes class object
weve never seen yes wouldnt
filled thing dont
make sense dont make sense well
basically made think like really
grateful mu mua feel
like mua mua look back
last couple decade
intensely studied small body
short period time
something like 700 something
observation span couple
week one object thats
evidence unusual right
point spitzer hubble
get trajectory really
really accurate noticed
nongravitational acceleration
made think maybe
object solar system
thing
never noticed
detect comet see
cometary tale right dont see
nongravitational acceleration
actually dark comet yes get
go mhm okay
consensus cuz eight year
right know
something would say
well would like say
jenny bergners recent theory
mua mua consensus
unfortunately lot
theory einstein theory
hypothesis hypothesis say
neil get touching
theory
hypothesis okay fair enough respect
office hate
planetar museum natural history
youre going say right youre let
youre good company
way people like
hypothesis okay go ahead jenny
bergner recent
hypothesis collaborator
collaborator mine who professor
berkeley mh essentially mua mua
similar dark comet
acceleration driven
outgassing volatile like ice like
material little
dust cone thats didnt see
dust coma okay
would explain yes would explain
little bit fact
better predicted
thing would exist right youre
forced sort clude answer
sound plausible yeah
others followed behind there
lot argument type
volatile driving explain
people volatile
normal person think somethings
volatile mean itll burst right
right geologist whole
separate usage term catch u
yeah
type ice could driving
acceleration volatile thing
volatile thing something ice
oh thought
say volatile mean ice
basically put
space sublimate okay
thought anything turn gas
volatile true
technically true water space
volatile yes water ice
phase mean volatile okay
wouldnt find swimming pool
liquid water anyway got
okay practice start ice
ice ice sublimate
volatile ice kind
water ice like ammonia ice
guess give co2 ice co2
dry water ice nitrogen nitrogen ice okay
yeah pluto
nitrogen ice pluto back
essentially solar system
comet primary driver
activity main thing see
water ice also see co2
co carbon dioxide carbon
monoxide typical one
mua mua spitzer reason
looked would
identify co2 co
spectral signature infrared
spit especially capable
detecting way hubble would
able thats right another issue
without getting much
detail essentially water could
providing acceleration
enough energy sun
sublimate water yeah thats right
sublimate enough water provide enough
push get acceleration much
better accelerant hydrogen
hypothesis
theory thought like
im gna say cuz im
okay hypothesis
water water mua mua
travel interstellar
medium exposed high
energy particle called cosmic ray
break water trap
hydrogen ice
heat mua mua come
solar system gently release
trapped hydrogen
greater
impulse accelerate object
thats right evaporating water
would thats right fact
hydrogen lot lighter
water also take much less energy
sublimate hydrogen water wow
okay right said there
nearly thousand paper object
youre saying
colleague hypothesis right
lone wolf
essentially come
hypothesis explain
mysterious property another thing
could acceleration driven
radiation pressure
work would ultra thin
ultra low density amaya moa martin
space telescope idea
ultra low density fractal
aggregate basically mean
large snowflake large
low density thats right right
there lot push
thats right push yeah yeah
thats right solar photon
subtly push asteroid could
suddenly push push lot like right
lot harder doesnt
orbital companion there way
know mass thing
make assumption yes
thats totally right yes
detail intentionally swept
rug yes rug
clean right
betting person explanation way
test another one
object seem remember
yeah
another one another interstellar object
two borisov
detected 2019
clearly comet big dust
tail okay exciting thing
r ruin observatory lsst
ill probably refer coming
online next year far ruin another
astrophysicist died year back
uh discovered dark matter galaxy
yeah back 70 named whole
observatory
observatory unlike
important way right coming
online right beginning
next year would 2025 2025 right
whats observatory going
going observe entire
southern hemisphere almost every night
itll like pan star
northern hemisphere itll
look almost every night see anything
moving sky go almost
five order magnitude sensitive
panars five power 10 yeah
well finding many moving
object solar system
finding many interstellar object
like dont appreciate
go telescope get image
bring home dont know
anything moving image right
know got get period
time theyre basically snapshot
need exactly kind data right
see something go bump night
thats right ruben telescope
blow open whole field yes
absolutely gotcha wow thats pretty cool
pretty exciting right
okay explanation
alien come guy trying
act like going talk
elephant room thats
easiest explanation got
right like ever ancient
astronaut something know
whatever exctly feel little
jealous amua mua got kicked
solar system star
system star system red
blooded star system ought
amua muas ive
kicked better star system
yeah essentially last couple
year since amua mua weve discovered
seven object within solar
system near earth object
actually amua mua
initially uh thought ao
thought neo thats right youre
picking uh abbreviation also
thought near earth
object near earth object
bound solar system
unlike mua mua elliptical
orbit hyperbolic orbit thats
correct discovered significant
nongravitational acceleration
seven object also
inactive mean dont
comet like tail oh okay
therefore cant credit normal
comet nongravitational
outgassing thats right
acceleration found dark
comet mean dark comet
name made hope think people like
object essentially
nongravitational acceleration
strong explained similar
mua mua acceleration see
asteroid
hypothesis thats awesome thats awesome
hypothesis
object like comet
icy material even though
close sun
long time theyre
whatever reason producing large
dust coma could layer
something ice encases
ice within oh yeah prevents
full exposure sun energy yeah
absolutely actually
idea idea wrote
paper could mua mua
like interstellar medium cosmic
ray basically could produced
insulating shell around could
prevented guessing
knew
nongravitational acceleration
right repeat think
said object thats icy
volatile ice cosmic ray basically
turn outermost layer ice
insulating crust yeah right
thats right water molecule
get broken yes longer
frozen water hydrogen
oxygen happens oxygen
essentially well depends
like like idea jenny bergner
hydrogen oxygen would
entrapped within ice separately
yes separately
like
create kind tar like material
kind like asphal almost
thats happened oh
get carbon oh would
originally okay
get co2 co carbon
rare universe cool
hows rereleased
well insulated
one thing going say
though certainly
happened mua mua cuz wrote
took like discovered
october may
acceleration published wrote
paper acceleration
published explained like
thats certainly wrong
saying
uh many branch
say wrong yeah well listen
thats thats make science
great like right today
tomorrow right tomorrow
werent today right
say sounded good
clear dont always say wrong
thing objectively
shown true right say oh e
equal act actually equal mc cubed
didnt knew noal mc squ
good right youre
mid hypothesis tested
come go youre first
box idea right thats
highly susceptible later data
show nothing better
correct making adjustment
correction somebody else coming
along going yeah guess man
youre dumbass c way
work official science term thats
super cool man well guess one thing
nongravitational
acceleration like asking
hadnt seen solar
system theyre difficult
detect dark comet
known
there one ive known
20 year people
monitoring 20 plus
year trying get po trying
measure position finally
noticed david far noia nasa jpl
basically figure
trajectory body
solar system included fit
nongravitational acceleration
there kind people
world monitoring object
know seeing could
potentially use term
fit mean think
pure gravitational there
formula forever predict
future trajectory youre
fitting future trajectory
fit way mathematically
right add term
think understand yeah
also mean numer like
numerically supercomputer
basically try different
type acceleration numerically mean
cant analytically right every
step computation
give position trajectory
whereas analytic
run formula itll get
whole way yeah effective
one admits dont
fully know physic going
fit model yeah fit
model yeah hydrogen
oxygen comet
affect anybodys sense
water earth came right
yeah also kind based
student who working
who starting started
last year got graduate
school got student already good
man love man thats
aster taylor paper published
discussed possibility
water dark comet could brought
water earth
comet right
well there people used think
comet delivered water earth
still dont know
earth ocean came part
reason sure comet
delivered water weve
spacecraft measure spacecraft
measurement water comet like
rosette emission went 67p
isotope thing
water comet
match weve measured
earth ocean would dyum
guess right yes thats one
duum hydrogen ratio
hydrogen one proton
nucleus proton define
label element
throwing neutron okay still
hydrogen like little
heavier right cant got
hydrogen something something
got got need something right
call dyum stable dyum well
stable
important thing amount
dyum compared hydrogen isnt going
change processing depends
critically temperature
formation change chemically right
comet doesnt match
ocean cant credit comet
delivering thats correct dont
know sure aster careful
say press release
news article paper
cant say sure dark comet
could contributed contributed water
earth new entirely
new population small body
new source potential source
theyre vicinity earth
potentially vitals would
need followup observation figure
match hayabusa 2
mission jaxa space agency mission
jaxa japanese exploration agency yeah
basically japanese nasa h
mission whats jackon nasa
jackson im sorry sound
racist nasa came first dude true
america okay listen dont
problem hayabusa 2 mission
extended mission
happens going dark comet cool
2031 going thatll blow
open might well least
going rond well
enough sensitivity measure thing
like outgassing dust
least worst case
scenario going answer
2031 literally comet
dark even dont
satisfy definition right right
think white thing moving
space material
dirty level reflective
comet well difficult say
dont always see
time dont even detect nucleus
rocky part comet
see tail asteroid example
like asteroid typically albo
word use science thats
reflective albo
something like 004 01
like 10ish per thats black yes
thats black okay yeah albo zero
one one like mirror
right remember uh moon
7 albino okay pluto
part pluto like there
glacier nitrogen nitrogen ice
actually albo upwards
like 90 oh wow reflective
bright spot look oh
know read article
talking another reason pluto
planet reflects
much make look much bigger
actually well initially
think would thrown
measurement right got
close person yeah well yeah
weve weve
done whats
future youre
reuben observatory exciting
thing finding know
upwards ten per year interstellar
object yeah would
serendipitous cant say go look
object look discover
object youre waiting data
come also
ruben better characterize
orbit known small body
solar system find bunch
much smaller one given
kind hit tip iceberg
term finding dark comet
would bet going find many
many dark comet subtle
nongravitational
acceleration right could kind
revolutionize think even
comet asteroid right cool wow look
cool whats especially delightful
learn entering
field right important telescope
feed field coming
online yes yeah dont
much data yeah oh yeah fact tell
much data coming ruben
telescope yeah huge amount
like quantitative
please tell chuck much
huge dont want say wrong
oh yes knowing
dont know knowing dont
think know something dont
last checked 20 terabyte
data day thats crazy day thats
lot yeah uh youre right though
huge
yeah huge huge yeah mean big worry
inar object mean mu mua
actually moving pretty slow
theyre moving much faster might
even link figure
computer algorithm data
could find fast moving interstar
object potentially l
theyve gone far one image
next yes exact
bias prevent u connecting
dot literally computational
algorithm connect algorithm
doesnt find another thing
asked cant discover something
algorithm doesnt even look look
right dark comet
mean ua mua revealed
nongravitational acceleration
werent looking strong acceleration
thing cometary tail
something way stronger
nongravitational acceleration even
mua mua would never link
basically make
exciting thing right
intercell object come leave
theyre never coming back
follow find
real time there huge amount
effort right working
trying make sure find
anything exciting get
followup make sense cuz
miss missed yes exactly perod
gone well like idea
entire new class object solar
system eluded algorithm
telescope thats cuz theyre
alien daryl delightful
enlightening thanks catching
thanks super cool stuff
thank let see wrap
right bow intrigue
science general especially
field
recognize admit confess
know universe
method tool tactic
telescope reveal u time
ever think
thought
five
sens one could imagine
anything would could exist
outside five sens
microscope telescope invented
around time broadened sense
understanding actually
exists universe continues
day every new bit technology
every creative
thought associated new
technology
brings new object new phenomenon
portfolio make
universe
contributes
majesty universe
universe become u
continue
explore cosmic perspective
daryl good man thank look
forward many fruitful discovery
get good data ruben
come back talk
right neil degrass tyson youre
personal astrophysicist keep looking
music
