got word assemblids yes
sound like somebody made
figure make
brain region putting
together essentially unleashing like
new force selforganization
really brain mean
brain build end
day often
experiment dish better know
like instruction provide
right time dont start
building new house really
clear plan tool
biology actually know cell come
instruction thats
call process selforganization
around frankenstein
day frankenstein would could
regular joe yeah street
like hey whats going
music
star talk neil degrasse tyson
personal astrophysicist today
going special edition
mean got gary oreilly gary neil
right man yeah always good
pleasure mine good
chucky baby hey babe right
good guess okay okay
good
gary always good
chuck yeah
got word assemblids yes
sound like somebody made
assembled yeah
assembloids well show
assemblids tell u
right long ago
show synthetic biological
intelligence prefer organoid
intelligence organoid yes remember
right remember
like 3d culture build brainlike
structure bio computing right
thats used
future overlord
right putting biology
onto technology something
different however based around
organo intellig
becomes organoids assembling together
oh selforganizing
organizing organoid guest
today right well okay
getting baby
could go wrong
let question yet
ill save end okay go
guest today great idea
trying get organoids work
together coined phrase
assemblid assembloids
guest work assemblids
help u uncover biological mystery
mind mhm
clump cell big petri dish
call life yes think sometimes
speak sometimes
feel like um let find
guest say petri dish
life yes beautiful
youre welcome im reading
um
let let see mystery
sold mystery still
guest uh drop
guest yes please
sergio pasca sergio welcome star
talk great thank
much yeah
youre neuroscientist star talk
special edition love neuroscientist
there serious future
opening right eye yes
plain plain sight fresh
frontier fresh frontier uh stem cell
biologist stem cell pretty
much news past
couple decade professor
psychiatry behavioral science uh
stanford think
however think psychiatrist
behavioral scientist theyre
putting someone couch observing
behavior sound way
invasive youre
sound puppeteerish
exactly also teding
thats good dig
ted archive correct yeah
excellent 2023
made knight order merit
romania oo right let get
back basic put u
page organoid
organoid clump cell
cultured dish
threedimensional structure name
actually organoid organike
supposed suggest resembles
organ similar function
course replica
organ supposed model feature
organ
scaffold organ well guess
like part organ like part
function organ
instance brain really
brain miniature
entire organ miniature would
like part aspect brain uh
modeled way
asteroid show star
photo theyre tiny
right theyre star
theyre asteroid little star exactly
organike guess let say
like starlike mhm oh wait oh
organoids yes right
organize
way selforganize give
instruction follow
well guess work
honest like started ability
actually even grow stem cell dish
like step back think
like came together
know stem cell know generally
derived know embryo
right uh certainly
like difficult uh study
certainly politically
fraught issue related
ethic using human human embryo
big issue guy
figured people figured
create stem cell without regular
cell regular cell
happened 20 year ago almost 20
year ago 19 year ago uh
japanese scientist shina yamanaka made
like breakthrough discovery
actually showed could
actually turn cell
body already differentiated
like back time look like
embryionic stem cell almost like
know sort like cellular alchemy
speak right like
always thought oneway treat
uh development oneway street
never sort like go back
page stem cell
always news reminder
nonbiologist kind
cell right condition
turn cell
human body correct exactly
yeah nerve cell muscle cell yeah
thats theyre prevalent
embryo embryo
manufacturing cell
right okay got stem cell
two property turn
cell renew
stay stem
cell long time
course multiple level stem
cell first one one
powerful turn
everything progress
development become
restricted
one real beginning uh
know one would
like ultimately
guide become different
cell tissue body wait
put time machine
box thats sitting behind
say
possible able take
brain cell youve cultured dial
back stem cell bring
whichever area need bring
really brilliant idea
uh build work done
uh essentially experiment
like simply done
looked main gene
expressed stem cell
said let see one really
important took put
actually skin cell
took skin cell starting putting
various combination gene
strongly present stem
cell
combinatorial know experiment
found four put
time know pretty much know
confuse cell speak
cell becomes reprogrammed thats
call cell reprogramming
cell really reprogrammed
state turn
property embryionic
stem cell make
anybody noninvasive way
course store ship
others really
breakthrough field
opened possibility first
time could get stem cell
anybody patient start
study uh addition
finishing clinical training around
time really large extent
like dropped everything uh
expertise im physician training
expertise actually autism spectrum
disorder neurodedevelopmental
condition like incredibly
frustrated lack model
study disease know
animal model know
animal model autism right mean
like challenging aspect
cant really access human brain
right mean sort like
know curse unbearable
inaccessibility human brain
mean behind skull unlike
organ cant like go
get biopsy study
sort like blocked speak
locked state couldnt
really make progress uh yeah
know 16 17 year ago
came stanford meme like
potential uh stem cell
make called induced plur
potent stem cell
started thinking could
actually turn neuron
patient study whatever defect
characteristic disease
outside human body thats
really enabled uh know
initially blew open
whole field point well exactly
open whole field know
beginning make clear
know mean got grant
fellowship rejected
time absolutely insane
know like actually like make
neuron dish even expect
find something disease
mysterious right think mean
autism complex disease social
behavior going see
actually dish
mean well get back probably
conversation actually
key u focus disease
actually like knew expect
sort like calibrate sort
like started uh know
entire journey beginning
experiment simple
know would take stem cell
patient uh derive
dish kind like spike various
molecule dish uh like guide
try become neuron
differentiation experiment like uh
easy 10 year ago
became clear going need
threedimensional aspect
development really capture even
complex feature brain
thats 3d culture
known organoids appear
first neuron
selforganizing know
theyre selforganizing
know go organized
thats good question
know mean selforganization
remarkable force nature biology
right often
experiment dish honest
long time like
thinking like engineer sense
oh want build something
dish let say circuit know
better like know blueprint
better know like instruction
provide right time
dont start building new house
really clear plan
tool realize
time biology actually
know cell come instruction
know make specific
cell actually come instruction
connecting let say
another cell reveals another set
instruction right another one
another one thats call
process selforganization
really formation order
structured know relatively
homogeneous element
way like talking physic
chemistry known 19th
century mean classic
experiment show know
molecule organize quite beautifully
know riot bernard convection
guess classic example biology
brings next level
organizes cell pretty much
youre youre
bringing together culture
3d culture message
direction already resonant inside
cell put
together group basically
going anyway
exactly okay uh one
detail make
part right dont
right part course wont
know actually
spend lot time generally
making part let think
human brain mean reason
human brain remarkable
part
different know unlike let say
liver liver relatively
homogeneous right cell type kind
like part like look
brain thousand
cell type mean recent
estimate know said
probably 2000 cell type
human brain right scattered
nucleus region
remarkable ability brain really
result cell interacting
early day like
know 15 year ago making
cell like spinal cord neuron
cell maybe cortical neuron
weve never really leveraged
ability cell connect
thats
essentially assemblids came
figure make
cell type brain region
putting together essentially
know unleashing like new force
selforganization really
brain mean brain build
end day know
think right
reorganizes like
damage part brain
reorganize function
might taken someplace else
least early development yes early
development
progress know
less less
happens right leave
cultured brain cell dish 9
month year happens
take care business
fade away
something crawl petri dish
go smartest dish
world itll chase
corridor get fork away
something actually
know really fascinating discovered
like know almost 10 year ago
one point know lab
still like early day
one point know realized
well mean expensive
experiment keep feeding
cell running money
lab told everybody
lab said better go
incubator like make sure
youre maintaining culture
dont need need focus need
save money somebody
lab come say oh also
like remove one like 300
day old like mean
like 300 day old like yeah
mean know know knew
keeping long
period time idea
could keep long
period time turn
make cluster cell
know sort like wish could
show wish
lab could show maybe
try look something like
right see theyre lot theyre
still like fixed see theyre
like relatively large clump cell
theyre floating medium
incubator keep going change
medium one point realized
keep long period
time fact maintain
longest culture ever
reported like keep
year question
stuck development
progressing development
series paper discover something
really fascinating like
actually keep track time really well
well actually arrive
9 month keeping
dish actually transition term
gene expression
property cell postnatal
brain almost like know
birth happen wow there
almost like think
sort internal clock keep track
time brain clock
ive read yeah brain
clock exactly im fascinated
cell ability
understand basically calendar mean
theyre theyre
observing sun going across
sky day night yeah whats
whats whats tech
mean may think
know surprising think
surprising
mean every time make human
youll always make like 280 day
here interesting thing
take mouse stem cell okay
like chimp stem cell
differentiate way
dish theyll finish development
time
time period reflects
gestation period chimp
mouse like three week
rat like know
whatever mean
evolution actually selected know
well like period
development theyre intrinsic
cell think
surprising u happens
also outside body right
outside uterus course
say aspect
development recapitulated mean
kind thing
coming right kind information
coming shaping
development know
invest human brain development
environment important
like sensory information right like
cognitive development think motor
behavior afterwards especially
early stage development everything
quite well regimented go
according calendar nobody know
clock nobody know
molecular mechanism
somewhere cell
something counting somehow time
thats great time
neuroscience
like people like come
cell derive energy
know talk clock
there battery back
powering cuz theyre outside
theyre outside body theyve
got whole human system back
feed sort like
know soup chemical
made sort like lab like
provide glucose right mean
need glucose amino
acid give lipid right
need fat
like call cell culture
medium measure
expressing
prescribed function cuz neuron
specific function absolutely
know
actually expressing function
kind thing like first
look see often know
cell mean often time
cell signature know
express certain combination gene
generally first question
think youve made cortical
neuron let say neuron outer
layer brain know
cortical neuron well first
kind like look gene
express compare
know neuron actual
brain look look
theyre often neuron cortex
sort like pyramidal shape call
parameal neuron look
look pyramidal pyramal mean
like pyramid yeah exactly
pyramidal okay parameal yeah
guess really look like tiny
pyramid yeah inverted pyramid like
thats sit cortex
look like shape
cell body thing
sometimes move specific
way thats actually first
assemblids actually looking
cell moving here
interesting fact know may
think know
cell type brain right
theyre made know
build brain theyre made sort
like place sit
actually know
rule rather exception
cell reside place
theyre born brain
lot movement think
cortex okay like outer
layer brain neuron
exciting neuron
neuron inhibiting
neuron good
balance two
much excitation get epilepsy
right know think
here interesting thing
excitatory neuron born
cortex neuron
inhibitory built deep part
brain literally brain
development start moving crawling
inch many many month
arrive cortex
kind like establish
balance order build
cortex enough make
excitatory cell make
inhibitory cell
question come together
assemble thats
name assemblid came
essentially vision like almost
know 12 year ago let make
two part brain one
make excitatory neuron
one make inhibitor neuron
put close
hopefully cell know
certainly dont
know guide um move
turn exactly
put together
gabbergic cell immediately start like
process cellar
process start like smelling
cortex literally
start jumping know see
cell literally spend 3 hour
look direction
make jump 40 micron wait
another 3 hour kind like smell
cortex make another jump
process never really
seen human happens
third trimester life
whats going every developing
human youre describing
professor youre saying
basically uh bunch cell
uh field theyre
looking recognize one another
start running
slow motion well pretty much
pretty much really come
instruction
think thats happens
development thats build
brain mean brain may little
bit different
grand scheme thing theyre quite
right mean
structure like know
phalamus spinal cord
right pretty much
position order
know brain build
way remarkable force
bring cell together
every time build
human brain wow okay
last thing im sorry know got
move next subject here
like percolating brain
right kind
perfect technology would
able introduce cell
go let say
instance repair part brain
kind make stupid dont
believe climate change something
well sort like self assembly
actually work really well early
development sense
cell open like connecting
others turn
progress development
cell become less less permissive
dont cell moving brain
right okay know
adaptive challenge
start add cell
adult like circuit already
formed easy got
know um dumbass circuitry
dumbass circuitry fully formed
strong right however
youre able prenatal identify brain
disorder disorder child
might able gestation
process go make uh
change exactly thats exactly
actually even early
birth human brain develops
like year even born
thats amazing professor
thats amazing right
professor work
research cell said
work autism patient like
there something called timothy
syndrome autism epilepsy
seems terrible combination
terrible timothy damn yeah
afflicted cell
timothy syndrome correct yeah
reverse engineered
could find way work
basically said take away
right could mean
explaining well
probably could better
would mean go back
like know previous point
talking stem cell
like discovered
potential question
really want model disease know
want model complex disease
autism uh epilepsy know
actually start mean
psychiatric disorder mysterious
disorder still dont know like
know thought complex
social behavior arises brain
actually thought would start
genetics one thing
know many
neurodedevelopmental disorder
theyre caused mutation theyre
caused severe mutation right
there rare rare syndrome mean
literally found 30
40 patient english speaking
world today
mutation patient protein
actually channel calcium
cell every time neuron communicates
another neuron open
channel let calcium
essentially translates electrical
information chemical information
inside cell turn
patient one single letter
mutation entire genome one
single letter make channel
open little bit longer thats
time open
know slightly longer
idea model
disease could make neuron
patient look
actually monitor calcium inside
cell see
calcium mean started
modeling disease thats exactly
wanted really
ascertain really studying
disease process relevant
know actual letter
youre talking youre
talking dna sequencing
know actual letter
something like crisper go
snip letter well sadly
would change everywhere
brain probably go
know doable
today okay patient
severely affected mean theyll
epilepsy theyll autism spectrum
disorder heart problem
many would die
heart problem thats thats
sort like started
cell patient
model ive told
past 15 year kept building
model complex try
understand disease first
understood calcium get
cell saw cell
moving right theyre connecting
properly three year ago
know one
interesting know time sort
like academic life one
point accumulated enough
information disease
essentially therapeutic became
selfevident speak like
look would say oh oh
make sense need
dont want go
detail weve
gene
processed inside cell weve done
screen essentially identify tiny
piece nucleic acid add
cell go right change
channel essentially restores
almost every single defect weve
discovered past 15 year damn
like within know couple
day insane know thats
youre talking
sherlock holmes real detective
work work exactly
whats necessary mean said
obvious obviously wasnt
otherwise someone would seen
long time ago around
frankenstein day frankenstein would
could regular joe
street yeah would walked
instead like would like
hey whats going guy
feeling
mapping sort ai
technology mean chriss one tool
others
empirical evidence experiment
large largely empirical mean
weve know accumulated
enough information biology
one point became clear
quite interesting think
could
first psychiatric disease
exclusively understood human
stem cell model meaning studying
studying human brain cell outside
body patient right
course question like
actually know know would
work know generally
use animal model disease
right um animal model
mouse mutation
well turn
mutation mouse doesnt really
recapitulate aspect disease
doesnt work well
also go straight
patient want make sure
sort like work sort
like invivo setting thats
one thing weve done
past year actually also
develop transplantation method meaning
organ assembly
weve building rather
complex still dont receive
sensory input dont mature
level started
actually transplanting meaning
essentially take organoid weve
made dish put
brain rat
early development rat
actually grow third
hemisphere made human
cell literally see
mri may think well
know would even
experiment well reason
actually human tissue
patient living organism
test drug
took drug tested vitro
dish injected rat
way would patient
looked effect human
cell making sure doesnt kill
human cell right doesnt
something else like one way
allows u actually test
therapeutic way like safe
essentially thing want
solve issue complex brain
disorder youre going need
complex assemblids mhm youve
taken assemblid notch
um daisy chained four organoids
together gone path
sensory could sort expand
u think
absolutely fascinating youre telling
feeling
youre telling let professor
explain know mean turn
think like
brain disorder know
sort like hardware defect
right mean part missing
think stroke right like
know lose like part
cortex disorder
consider today psychiatric autism
schizophrenia think
like disorder software
communication cell
becomes really clear really
want capture process outside
human body sort like need
reconstruct circuit outside
started like know maybe
five six year ago thought could
actually build circuit
actually output know really
easy measure decided
reconstruct cortical spinal pathway
mean know
really well everybody know
like biology textbook information
neuron cortex
generally go way spinal
cord make connection syninnapse
spinal cord neuron
spinal cord neuron go muscle
essentially three neuron two
connection stimulate cortical
neuron information go
spinal cord muscle muscle
contract right know easy
like text biology thought
could actually reconstruct
may think easy
dont know cell find
development way
idea rule
made organoid resembles
cortex one resembles
spinal cord made ball
human muscle biopsy get
biopsy muscle build ball
put three together
turn
specialized neuron cortex
every cortical neuron one
really go spinal cord start
leave cortex find motor
neuron motor neuron leave
find muscle three
preparation start contract wow
would threepart
assemblid right told
u even know odds
probability cell
find low
yet work beautifully
actually stimulate cortex
get beautiful muscle contraction
weve using uh know really
last year identify
instance polio virus nonp
polio virus actually affect spinal
cord cause paralysis
difficult uh study otherwise
important like preparation
add polio virus
cause paralysis circuit uh
dish work yet published
tell like useful
preparation like uh
beyond useful mean im im
trying figure figure envision
time weve mapped like
everything right
layout would time
youre saying well
able go identify child
developing womb
uh identify mutation take
assemblides put child
mutation corrected
child born deal
perhaps even easier scenario
mutation know
patient serious
mutation build assembly
model disease patient
without using patient brain like
avatar want right mean
thats assembly think
right avatar
circuit simplified dish test
drug screen drug maybe
want screen quickly drug
right use
patient
every single patient dont
actually uh process
particular patient
developed drug mutation
boom boom boom every
single person mutation get
drug delivered thats
wow thats amazing get
need get better
understanding cuz see
quite wait
understand cell
theyre already know
news scientist
thats right cuz he look look
neil neils looking like
dare he scientist dare
dont accept
understand go please
actually think like richard feman
famously said im sure know
cannot create
understand know
think little bit right
cannot recreate circuit outside
going difficult u
understand dont understand
biology breakthrough
medicine came last decade
think cancer child right
60 90 lethal today less 10
lethal entire revolution
molecular biology right
tissue interest accessible
get blood patient
leukemia tumor bring
lab deploy power
molecular biology psychiatry
neurology really last one
cannot access brain
belief gain access
brain method
others noninvasively going
able deploy power molecular
biology make breakthrough
molecular know psychiatry
neurology weve done know
uh cardiology branch
medicine thats thats sort like
see may wrong
havent got assemblid thats
like said four stage assemblid
youve worked sensory
feel understanding pain
becomes hyper
sensitivity point people
feel pain oh oh okay
thought meant like theyre going
little vial screaming
middle night
give pain one
youre youre right one
thing trying actually
came mean made
first assemblid like 2017 took u
three year make go
twopart assemblids threepart
assemblids one motor
explaining took u
another five year get four part
assembly technically
complicated
pathway sens know sends
information think
know want sense anything
even painful stimulus finger
nerve terminal coming
neuron sit close
spinal cord receptor
sense send
information spinal cord
spinal cord shoot information
phalamus middle
brain phalamus sends
cortex sense something
happened know thats work
essentially tried
reconstruct part
made neuron
receptor including receptor pain
know receptor pain
actually respond capsain know red
hot chili pepper thats like
hot specialized
receptor add capsain
beautifully respond like
electrically never
witnessed mean
put entire circuit together
never really done
biology witness
first ever time well
beautiful part honest
made part took u
year know four part
circuit put together
take 100 day make
way another 100 day
cell connect
one point started like
looking seeing like whats
going weve discovered something
know really remarkable cell
circuit become synchronized
mhm initially
sparkling know
noncoordinated way one
point activity seems
starting one side go
know one
unidirectional circuit almost
know there stimulus
way know almost like
know also brain development
brain prepares even
receives sensory input
come almost like
practicing practicing add
know stimulus
relevance pain
interesting maybe youve heard
neurologist discovered
know past 20 year
patient mutation
make either completely insensitive
pain literally feel pain
really caused mutation
channel sodium channel
opposite channel
hyper sensitive theyre hyper
sensitive pain
obviously
used crisper cuz talking
crisper genetically
modified cell dish
mutation present patient
put together four
started watching see happens
patient hyper
sensitivity pain theyre
sensitive pain see
information going really really fast
cell super active
sense one
pain like there activity
actually found
there lack coordination right
cell essentially like lost
coordination thats
important part
really end day know
brain sum
part obviously clearly order
understand disorder
going need
part put together get
emergent new property feeling pain
well thats new thats novacane
movie isnt yeah know
mean see certain people
okay remember
tv show neil crazy thing
could stick hand water ice
water im im saying
right take bunch ice add water
actually becomes colder
freezing okay yes right
put hand burn
hand experiment
stuck hand stuck hand
literally hand started burning
normal person would
hand burn able leave
hand god awful amount
time point
squealing time well yes
burned cool
literally burned cuz cold
hot right literally burned
felt like burning okay
reason
know chocked got
lot fat hand get
seriously matter
sensitivity pain absolutely
didnt say
didnt feel pain
could deal yeah oh
well change oh
okay explain mind
matter aspect yeah thats
great point actually cuz see
pathway pain turn
least two pathway
brain one allows
tell painful stimulus
know sense finger
hand water foot
right thats one tell
second pathway
actually leverage brain
region amygdala singlet
cortex tell really
bad give unpleasant
feeling emotional component
pain know theyre interesting
patient dissociate
two patient
let say stroke tumor
insula singulate
cortex youll patient
theyll tell know know
youre uh know youre hurting like
finger tell
finger doesnt feel unpleasant
pathway
dissociated brain
work weve done weve
reconstructed basic pathway
process pain stimulus
emotional component wouldnt say
theyre feeling pain way
right make clear cuz
imagine kind
ethical issue arising
like work
obviously know want
model closer human brain
think many
psychiatric disorder uniquely human
yet closer
human brain uncomfortable
feel right think like
mitigating risk moving forward
think important
experience
sense sensor aspect reverse
engineer way get drug
alleviate hyper sensitivity pain
sure mean many way
like think
god guide well everybody
everybody everybodys got thing
opioids must must
mechanism opioids use
sort tag get
addictive part exactly think
like sad
best best treatment
like pain come like poppy seed
discovered thousand year
ago chance right mean essentially
piggyback circuit come
deep understanding circuit
circuit dont make
opium poppy seed yes okay
want clarify yeah
think idea
circuit dish add
opioids way see
modulate see okay
opioids circuit let
try thing different
way right right one sort like
know driven biology behind
think thats beauty
beauty way uh
professor ever get place
please email right make
public would like
first
investor painfree opiate
nonaddictive mean
thats thats end game
right clear
chuck cuz hand
want like get back hand
bucket yeah okay long ago right
began wrestling high school
going bring
think athlete
athlete deal pain
time exactly judge
looking situation pain
something cause irreparable
damage simply pain okay
im looking hand
bucket ice yeah hurt
care care im going
get frostbite okay see
gary im sure cuz
gary ton surgery he
played pl pain sat ice
game right see
played none ive done none
thats
whimped time need
pain work okay
way pain work experience
brain body
everything soul go jesus
please lord oh thats
youre saying youre
building avatar detective
work come finding
clue answer
finding clue got sit
scratch head hopefully
come answer really
empowering sort psychiatric
research youre interested
know way look know
psychiatric disorder
mystery like doubt mean
complex behavior hallucination arises
brain mesmerizing u
long time almost like
think
almost like seeing uh know
egyptian writing first time
right look know
even start mean theyre
beautiful drawing know could
classify based like animal
cant make sense
meaning see thats
know think like
historically discovery
rosetta stone right like tiny piece
tablet first time
euroglyphs one side greek writing
one right know
french scientist came
napoleon find start looking
becomes essentially
know enabling tool suddenly could
actually see word
know cool thing rosetta stone
like shopping list something
like deep like
bread egg
dont know exactly shopping
list something completely
mundane well something really
trivial absolutely yet like
writing know
side think
question need somehow translate
one point like mental
process complex
deal really
molecular biology thats
control molecular biology
control think know
large extent ive ive seen like
mission know lab
general like think
community broadly really try
translate complex
phenomenon brain simple
process calcium neuron know
two neuron connecting
hopefully
finding way reversing
also reverse least improve well
dont know know
know yet done uh
know well see whether
clinical trial actually
successful mean preparing
clinical trial tim syndrome right
still like last stage
preparation found
patient uh world building
special unit stanford
going hopefully bringing
next year
clinical trial well see
know first
disease mean uh look
timothy syndrome like really
first first half dozen
condition weve
studying various angle really
mean see going
golden uh age human neuroscience
im delighted learn youre
putting much effort
disease rare yeah mean
think rarity least
people benefit
attention given rather
someone making costbenefit
analysis saying
anything going
going road right
saying
assemblid research work going
key understanding
hidden brain biology soon
think maybe really able
tick timothy
syndrome take horrific
disease oh already working
others uh mean know least
half dozen weve studying like
associated epilepsy
intellectual disability
form schizophrenia weve
deploying like systematically
another thing weve done
honest sort like
spirit stanford
uh know lead center
beginning know
published
first method everybody like oh
know come lab learn
like want
brought people initially
one point know couldnt
train enough people actually
started literally course
bring student world
various lab week
almost like cooking show
think right know
experiment done
show critical step
need weve
helping 300 lab around
world um know implement
method breakthrough
going come lab
therapeutically speaking thats fine
probably come
somebody else somewhere like know
corner europe know south
america experiment rare form
disease finding therapeutic
would fine think
there much know one
four individual suffers
psychiatric disease today right right
huge burden going come
across situation going
youll faced building
assemblid creating assemblid
complex
limit assemble
absolutely limit
assemble know like
many feature assembllet
really fascinating surprising
know still lot
limitation know mean theyre
vascularized dont receive blood uh
supply may able stimulate
like capsain something else
theyre receiving rich
sensory information important
know think know uh
kitten
know cover one eye cover
eye week uh cat never
see eye adult
cat week problem whatsoever
early development
circuit receive right input
wont develop properly know
model relatively
complex already lack lot
complexity know
george uh box famously said
model wrong useful
know model make
goal make perfect model
brain like make good
enough model part brain
circuit give u
breakthrough therapeutically wouldnt
harsh term model
would say model almost
construct incomplete right
wouldnt make wrong necessarily
theyre theyre whole
story thats theyre model
thats theyre model otherwise
would exact thing
wouldnt need wouldnt need
model could replicate exact
thing would thing
right okay yeah love
assemblids sound like cartoon network
show like assembly weekday 3
right transformer know
