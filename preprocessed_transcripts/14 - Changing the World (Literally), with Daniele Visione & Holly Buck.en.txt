say geoeng engineering
mean would first time
consciously decide globally affect
climate benefit engineering
purpose right youre talking
radiation thats coming
greenhouse gas trapped literally
becomes kind bounce board
called science yeah cool
isnt pretty cool
music
star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist
special edition going
talking
music
geoengineering gary cooked
yes cohost gary
man im good right youre
looking good shape um breathing
weve discussed breathing
breathing im
yes welcome back cohost
pleasure right gary
say right annual isaac
azimoff memorial debate take place
hayden planetarium year
2025 geoengineering pro
con um seen many
controversial approach
solving solving global warming
others see potential
effective number
different option
consideration uh come
scientific issue ethical
consideration well predebate
kidnapped two panelist
sorry weve dragged locked
office going
debate cuz couldnt wait
evening uh
come willingly help course
he still box
danielle vision danielle welcome
star talk thank neil thank
yeah let get little bit
bio assistant professor
department earth atmospheric
science cornell thanks coming
state join u still
snowing cornell snow
time yes yes
yeah get uh
youre climate scientist specializing
cottage industry people
care stratospheric aerosol
behavior oo whether
misbehave behave intend
thats thats whole let find
youre also specialist
theyre calling climate intervention
method impact would
climate ecosystem even
culture society
mean damn thats
high responsibility
yeah word dont mess
yeah lining every lapel
say dont mess know
idea thing
would work people discussing
decade would say people
point edward teller actually
first one discussing teller
hbomb fame indeed infamy um right
people discussion could
fundamentally deliberately alter climate
long time right long
understood climate weather
machine one day rule world
yeah yeah indeed
way one could say nothing new
except problem global
warming climate change became
preminent
scientist started thinking
maybe bit deeply wasnt
fringe idea fringe idea
sense lot people
initially longer fringe many
would still consider fringe
least would like talk
much thats different okay okay
fringe sense would
say scientific basis well
established climate
science issue
sort ethical societal
dimension bring topic
different light understood
bit reading
prior awareness understanding
problem solution
volcano mhm pump
manner nastiness yeah nastiness
atmosphere nasty nastiness
atmosphere get
study thats nature
found history
volcano yeah interesting
thing benjamin franklin
one first everybody love ben
yeah great scientist
first person point
potentially weirdness
climate people seen
early 19th century due
tambbora eruption volcano
indonesia exploding 1815
okay he around course
time remind think indonesia
also crakatoa mean there
shortage volcanic there plenty
volcano tropical band yes
yes close equator sometimes
go explode yeah
get see way ejector
go like go west east right
following prevailing air current
people get study
clever enough connect dot
odd weather odd
atmospheric phenomenon volcano okay
foundational
background go forward
yes 20th century
least three different
volcanic eruption big
tambora still big enough last
one pinatubo 1991 know
observing
telescope pinatubo went
changed optical property
atmosphere redo
data pissed
favorite volcano assume cuz
telescope stuff came
right went took
took
scientist taking cue mother
nature dont mean
sarcastically fact
great yes putting sulfate
aerosol tell
aerosol okay aerosol u climate
scientist define every kind
solid liquid particle suspended
air suspended part make
aerosol yes suspended part yes
yes okay fact
suspended make
aerosol matter like sars
kv2 mhm see thats
interesting thing
lot discussion
constituted aerosol came
discussion around covid
different definition
climate scientist consider
aerosol tiny particle
submicron scale float around
long whileic droplet millionth
meter small small
gravity doesnt really much
turbulence actually keep afloat
large droplet like one
like spit medical practitioner
consider aerosol aerosol right
lot
confusion beginning around around
airborne two slightly different usage
term like term
term term get reducing mean
temperature earth science
aerosol perform
mean temperature mean average mean
temperature make fun
lower temperature theyre mean
temperature theyre pissed
temperature go okay go
aerosol think
submicron scale thats end
size wavelength
visible light get oh
specific size
really interact lot incoming
sunlight thats wild
photochemical actual like
geometric physical block
there also chemistry mainly
aerosol around
size reflect interact
solar radiation scattering uh
various scattering process
scattering mie scattering
thats simple scattering
wavelength light match
particle redirects
go like
scattering different kind
scatter give u blue sky
blue sky thats much whole
episode thats light yes
great way make much
sense whats youre talking
radiation thats coming
greenhouse gas primarily carbon
trapped carbon dioxide sorry
trapped ground radiates
heat atmosphere thats
trapping different wavelength
correct completely right infrared
infrared right thats wild
literally becomes kind
bounce board called science yeah
cool isnt pretty
cool im saying
still call wild
end day science
process successful
level would want
successful much aerosol
put stratosphere
long mean get
argue put
matter seasonality
learned volcano
go right remember
correctly think late 80
talk
nuclear winter total nuclear
exchange would burn forest put guess
aerosol atmosphere blocking
sunlight plunging earth
darkness cold would
bad effect youre
trying make good effect mhm
let great question
also
connected right aerosol
already aerosol around u
right pollution haze
see new york city thats
pollution aerosol right
make lovely sunset let
real make lovely sunset
super bad health
burn fossil fuel burn coal
produce aerosol
super bad health
never worse beautiful
sunset wait want hear
need im trying
think come come
mostly burn close
live stay air
cloud whenever
there rain get washed
away right actually currently
clear raindrop form
particle absorbs much
sulfate sulfate actually
well good cloud nucleus
kind particle
aerosol particle say
something thing rain
typically mean droplet formed
particle also mean
droplet falling absorbs
tinier particle thats called
wet deposition wash whats
real term uh wet
deposition wash love yeah
normally emit human
pollution 100red million ton
sulfur dioxide precursor
sulfate aerosol uh per year 100
million ton lot
fall close live right
acid rain people alive
80 people alive
80 remember acid rain never
wait get chemistry
remember chemistry sulfur dioxide
acid combine
hydrogen get hydro
h2so4 sulfuric acid
would acid range so2 get
oxidized radical
present everywhere atmosphere
eventually result another
three reaction result so3
h2so4 got h2so4
vapor form sulfuric acid tends
nucleate sulfuric acid particle
liquid aerosol droplet acid rain yep
rained back 80
u emitting way sulfur
global emission
160 million 150 million ton
getting u going
europe well china
india going
general still around 100 million
ton aerosol particle
cooling effect know ipcc
intergovernmental panel climate
change known
cover small fraction
warming produced greenhouse
gas youre saying effort
clean air taken
particle
thereby increased effect global
warming unmasked unmasked
unmasked thats word
normally used unmasked part
global warming
sort hidden
part observation right
need masking close
surface need hundred
million ton aerosol
stay couple day mhm okay
idea behind something like
stratospheric aerosol injection
could put tiny fraction
aerosol would stay though
100 time longer
surface falling right
month year essentially
would get bang buck
right smaller fraction
would get amount cooling
far away people live
breathe could get
effect pushing pull
whats make stratosphere
special long something would
last
making cloud right there
cloud there water vapor
stratosphere dry there
rain also troposphere
called troposphere
turbulent right
turbulent live right
airplane
troposphere there stratosphere
called like
stratified thing there turbulence
thing move slowly
never thought
turbulence turbulence
youre
turbulence stratified thats
call stratosphere good
thank put italian
stratosphera knew would cool
word stratosphere well thats
come right yes yes
original
latinop latin root yeah
put something especially tropical
stratosphere thats
large scale call breer doson
circulation essentially large
scale stratospheric circulation
push thing push thing close
tropic push pole wward
eventually air
stratosphere go back close
pole take year year
half parcel air
originates material
stratosphere go way get
removed stratosphere got
get good spreading
effect right
thing
latitude even importantly
longitudinal way put
another one thing make
stratospheric aerosol injection complex
political point view
cant put aerosol top
u theyre going stay
theyre going spread
throughout definitely whole
latitudinal band china
latitude u europe
theyre aerosol going
week longitudinally wind
fast week two
there complete spread see
volcano time small
volcanic plume spread couple
week throughout whole thats
know cuz chilean andes
pinatubo east u
came due west messed mess
mess mess
explosion iceland brought
civil aviation ground test
see pronounce name
volcano name
volcano iceland everybody call
uh lot volcan
volcanologist call got
answer deserved thats
answer deserve stopped air
traffic heathrow
everywhere europe yeah
sulfate
potential issue say
going sit area
commercial airflight
descend two thing volcano
explode time
explode main thing
shortterm larger effect ash
right right thats thing
dangerous aviation
ash interacts
aircraft everything right
glassify real
danger volcano say
glassify think im sure
whether thats actual scientific term
let pretend love
ash getting heated
engine right turning glass
glass wasnt already heated
volcano right cool
pretty quickly ash
actually form way
sort undergo ash pretty
okay people get buried ash
like pompei uh
pompei ash eolano ash
okay pompei magma
yeah lava magma flow
actually mud flow really oh
thats right thats everything
preserved preserved right thats
right thats right mud flow
yeah hadnt fully appreciated
ash
worst yeah ash
first thing thing actually see
dont really see sulfate right
thing dangerous
one two day time scale week
right also ash also
tiny breathe
dangerous
dangerous aviation volcanic
eruption also climate
scientist lot sulfate
volcanic eruption also launch sulfate
atmosphere instance hunga
tonga happened 2022 huge
volcanic eruption almost
sulfate water vapor pushed
ocean
almost sulfate hunga tonga
something like 300000 ton sulfate
pinatubo 17 million ton sulfate
couple hour much
kuna matata
um would go back check
number dont know good question
putting aerosol
stratosphere weve got
natural cycle mhm wind
system discus
sovereign nation say
well dont want flying
territory owns territory
particular country
find counterpart every country
speak
government come agreement
thats definitely
scientist yes constantly talk
work climate scientist
world um sure
question though would say nobody
know stratosphere belongs
stratosphere place
actually one least regulated uh
know air airspace
troposphere know
who who liable thing
happen troposphere
there space treaty
regulating nobody really
regulate stratosphere long
time treaty exists
montreal protocol substance
affect stratospheric ozone
protects u damaging ultraviolet
light whole protocol
ozone ozone
ozone couple
year ago increase one
ozone depleting substance
predicted expected
took country year figure
country depleting
substance increasing depleting
substance coming even
hanging country
well country asia okay
okay uh even see interesting thing
agency u scientific
agency found
uh product coming couldnt
point finger say coming
right could say think
increase coming
region world
enforcement mechanism even
mon protocol uh could say oh
stop mean country
voluntarily agreed stop right
lot international treaty
dont really enforcement mechanism
montreal protocol
matter country agreeing
ozone important
protected think country signed
treaty ever
successful climate
environmental protection treaty
world yeah every country signed
every country realized
important ozone year
yeah chuck missed yeah
okay cosmic phenomenon
affect mostly white people
acted
surprisingly correct
yeah
take motivate
powerful country world yeah
say get tan tan
risk youre going lose
beach yeah
could stress aerosol
achieve first clear
aerosol cannot solve climate
change climate change whole
problem come greenhouse
gas bandaid
say bandaid stop gap
call however want
something know people
dismissively say well like taking
aspirin cancer
treating underlying cause even
cancer youre right
dignified life suffer
pain right way
bandaid sense yes could
help temperature going right
could prevent warming
way could reduce risk
come warming know
going come warming
already observing coming
warming see couple
question fast one mhm climate seems
even astrophysicist
immensely complex problem solve given
variable given turbulence
atmosphere gas different
gas specie interaction
atmosphere ocean land
ai helping
definitely exploring lot way
ai could help reading huge
amount data already
instance satellite observation
thing like plume coming
volcano nobody could look
right thats ai good
pattern recognition finding stuff
human would hard time
really emerging field
there lot interesting thing
starting ai
okay here risk
learned want know
authentic worst thing
worry temperature
start rising say need
aerosol got two
competing force get tamp
there terrorist attack
people putting aerosol
aerosol fall mhm
catastrophic shock system
greenhouse gas going
thought masking
long asking long
instantly catastrophic
exposure greenhouse warming much
think contingency
mhm thats great question would
say something worry
except would say would
instantaneous stopped putting
since aerosol stay long
stop putting day
week month nothing really change
aerosol stay long
time stop year two
year thats unmask
worm right
give time
cushion yeah find terrorist
find terrorist kick as
rebuild rebuild course
would think
valid concern come um
strpheric carousel also one
point fact
essentially would need plan
carefully contingency plan
could rely one actor
right worldwide
thing could someone go put
something sure maybe could
stopped thats
would achieve anything achieve
anything would need carefully
planned thing contingency plan
happens need stop
instance ive done research
would happen volcanic eruption
happened youre
would well turn
know would ramp
maybe shift youre putting
aerosol try manage true
geoengineering understand
planet interact way
benefit yeah key difference
really word deliberate
say geoengineering mean
lot people ask well havent
geoengineering planet already
uh greenhouse gas maybe
way point gineering
say deliberate would
first time consciously decide
globally affect climate
benefit yeah unintended
consequence something
something else happen
anticipate
seen thats way polite
uh go horribly wrong
go perfectly fair
question thing look
know could go wrong
thing dont know go wrong
something catastrophic earth
atmosphere confidence
come confidence come
lot different observation main
one upper bound
wrong thing go thats
pinatubo volcano dump 17
20 million ton sulfate
stratosphere
stratosphere thing happened
right temperature cooled
change atmospheric chemistry
fundamentally thats
really catastrophic get
weve able understand
happened right top
sulfate came
yes much
talk sulfate reason
understand
environmental impact theyre good
sure understand
could thinking try
engineer perfect compound put
stratosphere instead sulfate
something work better
toxic could people
thinking thats legit
case thats something
understand interacts
environment long term well sulfate
something understand well
would say devil know
right devil know
understand upper bound wrong
mean experience
youve seen happen
clear rain come
acidify acidify region
could harmful wildlife
plant life um
opposed
pollution aerosol would mix
well actually would
fall aerosol would
fall ocean really
sulfate something affect
ocean acidification much
thats mostly carbon driven right
thats clear tradeoff would
increase pollution little bit right
10 many location
would spread evenly still
come affect fact
yes thats one thats
one thing definitely
looking looking
actually quantifying
understanding tradeoff
thing could go wrong could
well thing
could go wrong dont know
yet maybe havent thought
always welcome
climate scientist starting look
field suddenly
found found roadblock something
hadnt thought nobody thought
last 30
would make look really
cant dangerous
reason okay least know right
point research
least say nope weve thought
here reason
cant analogy
physic large hadron
collider theyre creating energy
risk might
create black hole
small risk small black hole yeah
yeah would consume earth
moved
proceed even thats small
risk thats small risk
catastrophic planet
turn nature gave u example
mhm theyre cosmic ray come
deep space like center
galaxy extremely high energy
higher energy anything making
inside accelerator collide
molecule atmosphere
making black hole weve
5 billion year
thats thats thats cosmic
peanut pinatibu pinatuba punatuba
thats cosmic peanut butter
nature calibrate expectation
yeah simulation
therefore testing
sit talking shop
decade sound like
im part team obviously right
surely testing go
must something pushing back
case
sound good true even
bandaid think well take
bandaid right yeah think thats
part issue right would
say work lot social scientist
well uh come
topic one time talking one
colleague really asked
question like well
sound good arent
kind set think
societal perspective right
good scientist want
look angle even angle
opposite youre trying go
right yeah clear
lot worry right
um talk people
theyre like wow sound crazy
thats perfectly good reaction
question
people stop reaction
ever happen going
take people suggest
people going experience
effect climate change
thats going change mind
desperation youre saying
dont think think
make plan desperation okay
hand people saying well
point
secure enough assessment
convince people right
think thats kind angle
try work think
main way going
meaningful discussion
move forward maybe start even
outdoor testing weve put
whole scientific community way
behind assessing robustly
know understand something like
trosphicol injection point
there yeah honestly handful
scientist compared whole climate
science endeavor amount
people looking
getting bigger bigger think
pretty close broader
international assessment around
topic mean
eventually maybe talk policy
maker people country
dont want know result
study climate model run
want know whats agreement yeah
right thats kind
important talk
international need need
geopolitical scientific consensus
consensus imagine thought
something like ipcc
really needed
might better position
get 10 people discussion
end 12 opinion course
always case trying get
nation sit around table well
bothering youre
putting sky oh yeah
theyre backyard far
making something like
implemented would absolutely
way predict would say
honest think instance
look climate change right say
honestly first assessment report
ipcc 1994
early 90 weve advanced greatly
fundamentally conclusion havent really
changed 1994 add
greenhouse gas thats bad
increase warming thats going
make thing worse true
want take case
optimistic view saying know
many advance come
climate change mitigation policy
enough definitely
right
paris agreement
united state america
paris agreement yes
stay long dont know
know solar wind kind
unstoppable there lot youre
right theyre going yeah europe
much um renewable china
even europe united
state spite carbon
footprint growing sector
still making great advance yes
understand see
economic issue dont even
care right look
necessity economy unlike
unfortunately supposed greatest
economy world
sense guess scientist im
going one making decision
whether
shouldnt sc
know im sorry neil well
weve met enough scientist
shouldnt one making kind
decision come well
laugh maniacally youre
thats get done
yeah thats youre
provide still think
overall strongest merit science
providing information
let people make good decision
make good decision time
human dont
thats good reason
provide information could
allow people make decision
let land plane saying
every stratospheric plane hey let
say every disaster movie begin
people charge ignoring advice
scientist
saying hear thats
danielle vit
love say oh love
thinking say thanks
joining u oh gosh weve loved
expertise put mix
stir see come
side year progress
dont know valuation
land know stop come guy
america 2025
america right america
thank joining u thank
next holly jean buck associate
professor environment
sustainability university
buffalo thats sunni sunni buffalo
yeah aint
growing one would imagined
department title environment
sustainability thats
mess right
nobody envisioned needing
need needing yeah also
radcliffe salata climate justice
fellow harvard oh sound like
superhero sound badass right
cape everything
interdisciplinary environmental social
scientist uh special attention
people engage emerging
climate control technology yeah
thats thing thats like whole
sociological thing
got favorite
title uh author book
2019 geoengineering
climate tragedy repair
restoration wow sound much like
movie day yeah
whats movie uh uh uh
snowpiercer snowpiercer
yeah thats climate
people messed yeah exactly welcome
star talk holly thanks much
great call
holly jean holly either one
great either one great holly jean
kind called holly jean holly
jean sound like uh country western
star know hi jean hi jean uh
weve come conversation
looking pro con aerosol
injection atmosphere could
give u option
achieve effect banding
today effect solar
geoengineering yeah mean
got got noble goal sort
protect earth
misdeed regarding climate
dont going
offer u um direct
question oh im sorry cuz
answer
well there plan shall go
plan please yes whole bunch
country including u
minute ago state well new york
state signed net zero
target right idea net
zero carbon dioxide greenhouse gas
general yeah mean theyre little
bit different target yeah
main idea dont put
remove oh need
happen midcentury actually
yesterday really soon
could happened yesterday
weve need happen yesterday yeah
still got issue
would happened yesterday
go ahead basically remaking
whole energy system right built
environment big transformation
thats thats people talking
yeah geoengineering right
get aerosol
atmosphere solution sound
bonvillain sound sexy
doesnt know sound like
movie right
take carbon dioxide
atmosphere dont
worry well sound
like mother know need
need sitcom dont
sitcom
word yeah thats go ahead
need
there limit much
mean think think
effort took take
ground right pipe
refining distribution
infrastructure talking
building basically
put back underground
limited place
actually store co2 yeah
interesting sort macro way see
yeah thats really
interesting way look
never really consider much
infrastructure involved oil
extraction refinery
let alone everything else involved
get know everything
put dont bury
example white cliff
thats limestone cliff thats
repository carbon
environment theyre buried
making im
didnt involve pipe put
back ground yeah people
talk closed system open system
carbon removal closed system
would injection well youd
injecting rock formation
deep underground less know
youre
talking open system
approach putting ocean
putting field
make rock weather faster thats bit
trickier harder measure
whats going transporting
youve got certain
industry produce awful lot
co2 dont somewhere
right doorstep screw
away ill call
pipe one transporting
way barge rail truck
oil
exactly two truck go opposite
direction highway took
two
thats
soft point thats funny
spending many billion carbon
capture plant right say
actually
real thing spent billion
trying start well see
still still nent yeah much
nent okay better tree
capturing good thats good
question love yeah mean
tree great whole bunch
reason thing landbased
approach need
providing habitat million reason
cant expect nature
work took
ground yes right limited land
tree unfortunately
want land growing food
basically stop eating
thats really answer stop eating
heating eating heating let
go get many land solution
ocean solution
co2 getting absorbed
water surely
creature would value
uptake co2 youre talking
whale concept one might
scale level need
youre talking plankton
hand seems
promising really early stage
research though theory
seems really positive
work whats procedure
basically concept ocean iron
fertilization would add nutrient
ocean create big plankton
bloom plankton fall
bottom ocean plankton
bloom anything co2
photosynthetic plankton
yeah yeah oh like tree yeah yeah
like plant would
right yeah exactly oh okay
light bulb went yeah thank
thank led light bulb
would expect nothing thank
youre growing plankton presence
co2 differently would
grow tree presence co2
except ocean huge happens
plankton die fall
bottom mean ideally
co2 would stay bottom
issue
category approach
science really early science
expensive right need
ocean chartered vehicle going
experiment havent
really begun process
laboratory potential
sink die phytolankton
capturing massive amount co2
surely toxicity
ecosystem yeah
oxygen right exactly there little
creature
matter care
little microscopic creature
put oxygen air
oh yeah cyanobacteria cyanobacteria
right yeah consequence
happen kind
stuff yeah would absorb co2
release oxygen whats
bad mean ocean life
oxygen
kind kind person
remember im sociologist okay
get
lack joined
thinking thats got u situation
first place surely weve got
look effect every living
thing environment go
problem need explore
need research doesnt
look there desire possibly
finance wrong
short whats needed
really get question
right youre
sociologist plankton youd
sociologist people
effect effort land
differently ac around world either
economically geographically well
rest world ripping u
thats first thing time
u make sure
dominance kind dominance
come drill baby drill thank
sure
chew nose mean there
couple issue one
unless people grasp climate change
energy transition situation
talking
idea probably going land
well dont know
know would try first
place right
country nowhere near
resource participate
would passive observer
possibly even victim effort
folly oddly enough
country far amendable
solution need enact order
solve problem would think
said would
one would skeptical
theyre freaking problem
right yeah yeah actually
research colleague
mine done several different
country trying learn people
perception find
support country global
south country facing lot
climate impact right
would caution people
havent heard anything
approach somebody hears
survey initially going
shaped people say
messenger friend family
start discus
people think
year yale report still
somewhere around upwards 53 people
say rarely never talk
climate change friend family
thats year report
even discussing
la right right
little group outlier
think
social consequence ethical
issue line
handle mean think first
step involve people
conversation okay
done lot way hardly ever
happens need agency
organization thatll yeah
need actually dedicated staff work
big challenge who
important voice need
heard regard voice
voice lean microphone
voice go asmr
voice yes holly jean
speaking powerful rich
western nation global
south african nation
demographic group well
everybody stake everybody
need something climate
energy right nobody sit
yeah nobody nobody getting
one
option youve seen horse
would bet effective
also humane may think
need triple nuclear capacity
goal
hope keep need
abundant clean energy people um
lot people dont
access energy turn table
antinuke movement
strong decade hope
weve seen public sentiment
shift pretty quickly actually thats
show katherine huff
small modular reactor right
nuclear reactor
scaled built
anywhere need right dont
think theyre point
commercially
put although weve nuclear
reactor submarine oh yeah
time must way
scale make uh oh yeah
practical oh yeah completely
completely plus there much
spoken dependent france
nuclear power decade
even thing right theyll protest
anything time day except
smoking give give true
example france nuclear program
new say new killer stop
giving france cancer every every
time youre imitating french person
put put nuclear power plant
northwest coast france closer
london paris thats
much french love brit
okay going mistake
make attempt
right thing likely
going get wrong mean see
lot um problem considering
dismantling capacity even
monitor whats going term
know attack science government
yeah there ton risk
although people concerned
share concern okay give u
something positive please tell u
tell u hopeful well
think public um thinking
shift question
one timing thats talking
geoengineering yeah
would know better others would
help make shift kind
force need play change
attitude perspective
something history youre
familiar public sea
change opinion happened
better thats kind shift
need least
america example
people point civil right
movement okay gay marriage um
social thing think little bit
trickier youre talking
reconfiguring built environment
mindset happen first
get ahead story
seems fair bit misinformation
regarding climate global warming
disinformation well thats exactly
there disinformation
get ahead narrative
start put real solid strong
take 53 make much much
bigger mean asked
technology said nuclear
also shift framing
investing social infrastructure
investing people think
administration
thats backing away thats
crashing social infrastructure
people going recognize value
relationship agency
functioning government well build
capacity
political build new
technology well social
match put word
mouth saying
dismantling social structure
social
institution
may awaken people need way
previously taken
granted yeah problem even
trump passed
money u climate energy
project couldnt get spent
fast enough didnt
enough people agency spend
review even hear
grant people ground didnt
know people realizing
need people
investing tech
going say take money
actually take money spend money
take money educate people
combat side
dis
disinformation fossil fuel company
socalled outlet
foundation right spent 900
million tracked last year 900
million disinformation got
come know
mean thats serious thing
got like land plane real
quick presumably ask
wouldnt say disinformation
would say information
really
empower listener know
difference sociological
perspective yeah
dont go people say youre
misinformed like
youre saying well youre dumb
didnt know right information
thats problem ive idiot
jesus
give information thats
grounded science say theyre
really hard tradeoff um
choice important dont
make people feel like stuff
going take away freedom
thats theyre worried
saying good job start
calling electricity liberty juice
liberty juice liberty juice need
focus group want save america
got get car
run liberty juice
right thought experiment
pretty good chuck think thats
answer yeah say say
fall technology
practical cost effective give take
get
preindustrial zero level
think well doesnt matter
burn fossil fuel want
control okay
thats thats big
argument yeah man
likely happen u weve
seen weve driven become
good yeah drill baby
drill care think burning
rock kind archaic like
think better mean
whatever think come
something outco competes
also economically
economics drive
specie thing anyway
tie shoelace together find
way shoot oursel foot
speak dude
good uh well think
danger many people see
anything thats viable
geoengineering scale
nowhere near way
fossil fuel company
use cudgel say keep
burning fuel know lot
people like thats concern
yeah lot people like
foresee presumably yeah wrote
wrote book called ending fossil fuel
challenge
end fossil fuel geopolitics
really tough
country really depend
revenue legitimacy
could see saying well let keep
keep going country like
venezuela qatar russia yeah
yeah country yeah
whole thing
saying stop burning fossil fuel
youll bankrupt country yeah
built whole economy unless
willing make massive transfer
finance apparently arent
yeah well becomes
problem sociologist
ill take problem fix
lot work love well
professor buck thank
star talk yes delighted
azimov panel
guy kidnapped star
talk good job thank
thanks much
uh know deeply
respect profession father
sociologist uh actually
received sociology award congress
think appreciated
much always tried think
impact science people
moved wish
well thank maybe luck
might need based stuff
go yeah human
interaction function thats
yeah screwed thank chuck
