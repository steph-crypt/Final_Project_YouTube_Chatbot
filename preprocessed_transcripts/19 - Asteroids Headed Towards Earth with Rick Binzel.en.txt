rick memory serf torino scale
there going number
consequence versus probability zero
really good 10 really bad day
dinosaur recently uh 2024
yr4 news green
yellow orange red want stay
red zone 8 n 10
level
certain impact yr4 uh
misbehaves uh would go way
eight trino scale
would
maximum star talk neil degrass
tyson personal astrophysicist got
chuck kn chuck baby hey whats
happening right cohost comedian yes
know im going talk
today oh gosh go ahead hazardous
asteroid pluto planet 9
saying pluto planet 9
deoa hazardous asteroid cuz
know planet knocked
know humiliated
completely youre
still havent gotten
like okay youre
dwarf planet like oh least get
planet youre like
know
asteroid well
expertise space dont
expertise want show okay
went back uhoh one peep
okay okay one people right
got one people invented
international scale measure
hazardous asteroid life
earth okay hell like
quality resume im
business card know tell
whether as fried thats
amazing let introduce u yeah
rick benzel hey professor richard
binzel rick man hey neil
great see chuck nice see
nice see yes retired
professor planetary science
mit stand um
massachusetts uh institute technology
thank took long well
know going say something
smart as saw bridling
yes bridle bridle
uh center
hazardous scale uh hazard scale
torino scale well get
moment okay ive got first question
already right youre coinvestigator
osiris rex uh remind rick
mission
one touch go yes osiris
rex touch go
successfully returned asteroid sample
earth back earth thats
badass thats badass g
find bug um
course boy asteroid
named 2873 binzel
password account okay
sorry tell thats
password he also staunch pluto lover
oh really weve dust
ups day could imagine oh
put thumb
dude old friend went
graduate school together oh wow
class graduate school
pretty uh pretty cool thats pretty
cool previous millennium
oh yeah way back okay since
school time
advanced technological equipment
disposal
school cuz give people
really got one ready
time able visit someone
house dial set number forward
phone number phone number
someone calling
home could still reach
dinner party oh wow
get phone number follow
telling thats amazing yeah
like good
phone number follow correct
call could youre forwarding
call correct rick
opinion
could connect home
could connect computer campus
dialing literally dialing phone
sticking box two ear
muff connect phone receiver
handset phone yeah handset
phone called
acoustic coupler could talk
computer campus
home amazing amazing h
amazing 300 bod 300 bit per second
yeah oh god thats
awful streaming video back
thats amazing published
paper age 15 forgot
paper
asteroid neil oh okay go back yeah
experience camp
run columbia professor named joe
patterson uh uh reached
high school kid gave
fantastic uh experience
formative career uh many
student became professor
professional
astrophysicist um anyway uh
super opportunity uh havent
stopped since research
project camp thats right thats
right okay attended
camp time
time didnt know
time get graduate school
find two u plus
another person class camp
attended camp
astronomy camp called camp
uraniborg camp uraniborg know
uraniborg historically believe
borg ship borg
youre youre borg
ship youre borg youre
youre borg youre borg
ship okay thats good one thats good
thats good uh
observatory tu bra oh tu br tu bro
thats buddy thats man like
got data planet
camp lived
nocturnally slept day
night totally
geeked 14 15 right
yeah exactly rick one thing
time graduate school
betrays affection pluto
rick made correct got
wrong made first
measurement light dimming
pluto moon going front
behind pluto sharon transiting pluto
correct best evidence
available time moon even
existed amazing isnt isnt
allowed people calculate
true mass pluto size
thats right neil uh
body space unless
something orbiting around um know
use kepler third law
calculate mass primary
mass system whats cap third
law please dude
explain
know oh people want
people know im
saying people might wondering
kepler third law right
kepler thirdd law relationship
orbital period um
object compared mass mass
primary mass system
measure size
orbit orbital period
calculate mass system got
mass pluto way ler
people wanted confess
right show
mass pluto mass
pluto
let tell something rick
great congress
court put pluto radar
jump street right
surprised
turned staunch pluto lover
whole life birthed
pluto mass yeah birthing
pluto mass also birth
demise go ahead neil looked
pluto five year year actually
spent 10 15 year total working
pluto system started
looking see could detect
moon around pluto um 1980 um
know fiveyear search uh
looking transit
didnt show 1985
continuing 1985 1990
uh technique use
looking planet around
star course transit exoplanets
planetary transit
kind
popular rick reminded
something fuzzy photo
pluto little bump
edge circular outline
uh fuzzy little bump
hint believe photo
emulsion back
authentic photograph right right
believe meant maybe
moon reminded
transit go exactly
front thing want
transit right angle wrong
youre going see see
thats looking
didnt see four year
sight line wasnt properly
oriented yet know
time yeah neil thats
right mean didnt know
didnt know angle
inclination orbit
didnt know earth
motion around um case
earth motion around sun um
simply didnt know
inclination sherons orbit
thats call moon today
didnt know inclination sherons
orbit didnt know would
become edge earth um
know going back bump
1978 glass
plate thats telescope didnt
ccds didnt
electronic detector yet back
day back day climb
uphill snow way get
telescope thats
thats telescope here
put head
hood damn old old man hour
okay anyway bump
fuzzy image would move around
moved around 64 day period
knew rotation period
pluto made sense know
really didnt know make sure
wasnt funny photographic effect
got transit 1985
first transit along
top edge pluto along pole
pluto uh beginning
long series transit
actually used make first map
pluto well say
dims brightens sharon move across
get blunt understanding
reflectivity exactly exactly
go across dark spot light
doesnt change much suddenly
edge moon go across pluto
get big light drop
know there really high albo spot
underneath cool high albo alo
love word yes almost
albo albo made
creepy made
creepy one fun word
give indication
mean thats true right yeah would
never know tell tell u
alido rick albo fancy name
reflectivity know something
low albo doesnt reflect much
light something high albo
reflects lot light ice
high albo lump coal near zero
albo percent yeah percent
mirror coat
white paint near 100 albo
right starting sound
racist hey star talk fan dont know
know audio version
podcast actually post week
advance video version
get spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk let ask
long time ago read
article mean long ago
talked cuz said
reflectivity albo talked
uh pluto reflective way
able determine
thats mostly ice
mean lot smaller
actually thought
seeing reflection
actual body dont know
anything cosmic object orbiting
sun youll make assumption
albo might based
albos made measured
correct thats right thats right uh
make first discover
something make best guess
albo reflectivity um
maybe someday get actual
measurement refine
first presumption
alido pluto uh probably around 20 20
okay okay given brightness
would say bright
reflecting 20 light
must side okay given
icy reflective
surface previously albo jumped
20 30 maybe
40 okay oh w yeah factor two almost
yeah thats big deal thats
work right right way
youre pluto book mention uh
dont know remember
believe actual word take
rick
let go back asteroid uh big part
career studied asteroid
cool conference
torino
italy proposed way track
hazardous asteroid might
came known torino
scale problem uh
understand there uh
2873 benzel okay thats asteroid
named yeah well wouldnt
benzel scale since youre
guy came
humble man gota got take
get okay grab
gusto glory like know
live time trump man got
know mean best
scale biggest beautiful
scale wonderful like know
measure everything measure
everything asteroid used
plumber used carpenter
best like call
torino scale benzel
scale well wonderful
best love whoa yeah ill say
tro scale talk
asteroid something
internationally fact
adopted conference
torino uh know gave
international flavor
people scientist youre
scientist always sharing
sharing
glory sharing wealth
one another collaborating
one another dont say like
bad thing know know
world live im
saying thats fantastic thats im
im im happy thats great
last read
forgive misremember
scale
multiple factor operating
simultaneously right one
risk hit earth two
much damage create
combined one
scale correct consequence
versus probability uh basis
scale rick memory serf
torino scale there going
number remind
put first trainer
scale 10point scale 0 10
right z really good 10
really bad day dinosaur yeah
way way calculate uh
object fall torino
scale depends size
consequence object would
struck earth uh versus
probability currently current
best estimate probability
could impact earth
two dimension consequence impact
probability scale point
specific asteroid
generalization uh
body thats might come way well
could apply anything really
matter object asteroid
orbit come close
earth um youre main belt
mar jupiter know
youre going bother earth
youre zero youre zero scale
yeah theyre zero theyre zero oh
asteroid name
whats hazard scale oh man
zero zero im afraid im happy say
yeah going say
would uh dont want asteroid binzel
come take eight like
okay whole thing rigged
created scale act he
one thats going take u tak
u
thats lex luor move right exactly
yeah yeah know lowest level
know thing green
green level mean oh
normal uh going find lot
um currently next
level yellow say
um merit attention astronomer
thats level three merit
attention astronomer uh
probability get worse would go
orange mean there possible
threat want stay
red zone 8 n 10
mean uh 100 probability
hitting earth
matter would consequence
quences consequence depend
object land uh
yellow zone wed ra wed rather
green um go completely zero
thats uh thats colorless thats
blank zero expect
object odds greatly
favor well get zero
keep watching
refining track uh get
information need drive
zero green yellow orange red
four color mhm correct corre simple
zero hazard doesnt
even get color recently 2024
r4 uh two letter
numeral news way
one think ten thousand
earth crossing asteroid one
happened one talk
today okay saw
13 chance hitting u
mean number given
discover asteroid um know youre
seeing tiny piece orbit um
uh moving space
know wed like project forward
uh extrapolate position um know
decade century
future make sure
going intersect earth
every asteroid thats
discovered didnt say slam earth
kill u
intersect right
dispassionate word without doubt yeah
go every asteroid
know every time discover
asteroid wed like make sure
know one good list
naughty list um know
case know asteroid
year 2032 fact every four year
come somewhere near earth
uh find
2032 um going come uh close
earth probably close
moon closer simply dont
enough precision um term well
know asteroid precisely
going 2032 decade
future know sure
going miss earth
know cant say
certain going miss get
probability uh intersecting
earth thats simply
really probability
number really measure know
dont know
measure know dont
know simply havent able
track thing long here
something might new chuck
able get prediscovery
image asteroid discover
asteroid future uh
chance intersecting earth uh
one trick go back
see shown uh uh
image weve taken asteroid
search know many year
find like
someone accidentally saw four
year ago didnt measure um
give u another four year
orbital length use
calculate forward
called prediscovery image uh know
people searching record
prediscovery image get longer
track asteroid havent
shown uh asteroid 2024 yr4
simply pretty small object
probably 5050 meter across
something like u tunguska siberia
uh experience
1908 know longest time
never capability even
seeing object space
great distance simply
capability gotten good
starting see really small
object far away know
start make extrapolation
forward um uh know
first probably many case
come um capability exceed
uh know precision computation
well well lot
case think coming along posted
short video series
called whats thats
producer say neil
news tell u
spent 5 10 minute
commented
uncertainty asteroid risk
hitting earth time move
uncertainty go one two number
go 100 zero
tighter tighter knowledge
orbital path
recently jumped
13 2 3 way towards
100 rick whats going protect u
need ben
affle bruce willis yeah know
disaster movie yes dude well ben
affleck movie yes
wasnt hero yeah like ben
affleck okay fine batman dont
confuse well batman
wouldnt call save
asteroid sure thats
superman job ever ever right right
way 100
yeah neil said
ultimately get final answer
well know either 0 100
either hit miss
odds greatly favor
50 one right
going miss like odds
turn asteroid uh
region uncertainty um like
long spaghetti string stretch um
beyond moon basically
way across moon
orbit um happens part
string happens lie top
earth spaghetti string
use italian pasta
torino scale spaghetti string um
shrink get data
improv track
asteroid orbit spaghetti
string shrink doesnt
earth underneath piece um
see probability number bounce
bounce around there really
surprise um ill say
ultimately well get final
answer uncertainty shrink
size grain basically tiny
grain chance
shrink uncertainty region
spaghetti string
single grain um single grain could
moon could
somewhere earth moon
chance grain
earth percent okay
earth grain could
top hackin sack new jersey
hoboken live hoboken hoboken
um thank destroying
live often think
uncertainty think circle
likely hit middle
circle less likely toward
edge youre saying given
orbit orientation circle
elongated maybe ellipse
severe ellipse
elliptical spaghetti strand
thats youre telling thats
right call uncertainty
ellipse really sort flattened
long string like
take pasta keep stretching
stretching uh
uncertainty region stretched
long spaghetti string yeah
linguini fetuccini
thought linguini start
getting thinly stretched
definitely spaghetti um dont
think quite angel hair past pasta
yet definitely spaghetti okay
torino strike yes
sauce need know need
know sauce putting
meal thats personal choice okay
okay right 50 meter
across tusa scale way
didnt telescope monitoring
killer asteroid 1908
hit atmosphere exploded
impact air given fast
going right without telescope
hit u would another
surprise air blast right
wise astronomer today question
hit earth easy
rule thumb big crater 50
meter asteroid would make yeah
10 20 one object uh say
one kilometer across would make crater
10 20 time size
fortunately 2024 y4 50
meter across thats right
size limit atmosphere
likely protect u ever
reaching ground depends
entry angle atmosphere um
know uh much resistance
atmosphere put
likelihood uh thing break
apart uh atmosphere pressure
wave still hit ground
thats cause damage
kind shock wave
looking know like
slap atmosphere would kind
result ill say
metropolis way tunguska
incinerated 10000 square kilometer
forest oh
blast wave
pulse
energy showed photon
light nice right remembering
correctly rick um mostly
wasnt much heat uh mostly
pressure wave call
pressure um would knocked
tree really flattened
forest hundred square
mile remembering fire maybe
right center fairly
localized damage
tree knocked hundred
square mile im going say thats um
pretty impressive term
disaster pressure wave
uh take many kilometer
tree mean yeah well 200 square
mile hundred square mile thats
insane thats insane guy
wait youre youre c
thats small compared
surface area earth oh yeah
small compared northeast
philadelphia one plane crash
took like three block people
remember yeah
couple little ago im
saying like youre talking mile
mile tree knocked oh
hard flat hard flatten tree
difficult thats small
thing well remember
earth surface water could
uh likelihood came
pas would overwater um
theyre poor coupling
pressure wave water wouldnt
want ship underneath
would prettyy pretty
easy evacuate chuck im pretty
sure right good fellow yes
spaghetti uncertainty
shrink dot going
hit earth well know exactly
earth going hit correct recently
capability become good enough
know small object size
compact car uh discovered
day hour know
terminal approach know
prediction get well find
basically tell people go
hold cell phone camera see
streak sky meteorite
hunter descend
area try pick piece uh
get know precise orbit uh
specific
thing going arrive thats
scientist talking say
know going arrive get
camera ready rather get
as leave get
going run know
sort thing run towards
know want get data man want
pick piece sence free stuff
free stuff space free stuff
space thats great mana heaven
right go rick 2024
r4 trino scale 2024 yr4
rank three torino scale
mean um strike earth
would localized event
think important thing three
tro scale like
emphasize likely get
data um well able reduce
zero three also sort
alert astronomer say let pay
attention object
worried one panicked
let get data make
sure going miss maybe
fund deflection program
say dont want uh
point scale
something mean whats
number like hey guy uh
go got get fix
eight nine 10 number
dont want tro scale
level
certain impact yr4 uh
misbehaves uh would go way
eight trino scale
would maximum oh
massive enough render anybody extinct
scale sound like
logarithmic something right
exponential higher number
much higher damage would right
thats correct true thats
true earthquake scale r
scale exactly ever wanted one

apus uh isnt osiris rex
visiting apus yes apus tie
current asteroid story back
2004 kind thing
apus got way four
trino scale uh case
able find earlier image
asteroid refine orbit rather
quickly um go zero uh
apus winner
term highest ever recorded value
trino scale mean
found pinned
orbit apus april 13th
2029 asteroid apus going come
close earth going
safely pas earth um
safe passage earth
distance closer
orbiting satellite one
g geosynchronous distance um
stadium siiz asteroid hopus
going make close approach
friday april 13 2029 friday mean
nature sense humor um ive
uh leading lot effort try
figure scientifically
study asterid hopus
earth gravity tide
earth exhibit moon going
tug asteroid
see responds way
earth tug well able
understand asteroid put
together thats terra incognita
weve never uh able discern
inside asteroid put
together giant net
like butterfly net go
want go
past want go past um yeah
well let go past simply
want get science
knowledge object
know know someday knowledge
thing put together could
important important
knowledge weve ever uh know
extracted uh space program
uh want
want get smart monitor
tital force would serve
break apart right stay
together spite title force
tell one thing lot
solid start breaking apart
didnt much matrix hold
together crumbly collection
cookie crumbles cookie crumbles thats
right doesnt care
umus around probably
thousand maybe million year
occasionally whizzing past earth um
probably come closer
previous millennium uh know
may say oh rodeo
really tough rodeo uh
may pas apus may
care uh much still naming
guy still naming earth crossing
asteroid newly discovered
god
uh impart death destruction
world apus egyptian
god death darkness right
still habit tradition uh
there lot different mythical
tradition know apus kind
show astronomer sense
humor okay yeah plan
name one
trump trump probably plan name
one trump exactly osiris rex went
trajectory sample return
intersect apus correct thats
right nasa approved uh
next mission osirus
spacecraft renamed osiris
apex apex pu explorer wow
uh repurposing spacecraft
go visit apus um law orbital
mechanic much propulsion
spacecraft dont allow u
get apus gone
earth going kind get
sort aftershot apus um
earth whatever might
uh asteroid youre going
touch go one right
well leave alone um except maybe
end
oh might crash yeah well
made sure going
go long period time may uh
kind touch let thruster
blast surface kind create
little crater look
um wont physically touch
asteroid um want say
know there really
fantastic cooperation european
space agency theyre working
mission called ramsis um would go
au get asteroid
reach earth could
european space agency uh giving u
look nasa spacecraft
ayus apex give u look
there still year
sample come back
asteroid benu yes
reveal reason went benu
looked like dark low
albo carbon rich asteroid
interested carbon stuff
made know carbon
carbon based unit
chance go back look
original carbon chemistry made
planet ultimately made life
found um primitive
carbon chemistry even basic
amino acid make
structure protein know
essential life really
found sort holy grail ingredient
um uh origin chemistry
make life part even
expected though right yes mean
thats wanted find um
important thing bringing
sample collected space
stored vacuum
capsule know un retrieved
pristine laboratory condition
knew everything uh organic
measuring sample intrinsic
asteroid space material
something introduced
know asteroid
meteorite landed pond mud
pick pick mud
get lab thing like
compare sample
space turn
um kind early carbon
chemistry extremely rare
meteorite earth
strong
material earth atmosphere
break apart incinerates
way hard
collect kind sample
free sample space meteorite
thats going get
getting kind sample really
scientific breakthrough implicit
said want make
explicit
asteroid hearken beginning
solar system undisturbed weather
erosion contamination theyre
perfectly preserved perfectly preserved
fair way say rick yeah
like call asteroid building
block planet uh
leftover rubble theyre leftover piece
material went make
planet make earth like
ikea like ikea furniture thats
stuff thats left building
block furniture
building block
furniture bit disassembled
time clash crash
million
million year fundamental
piece still
particular handedness
molecule life earth
molecule mirror
perfectly legitimate molecule
dont use version right
space there something
preselect handedness molecule
might expect 5050 mean
somebody got answer
there something
filtering something
something right somethings
something thatd fun see thats
pretty cool future
go yeah right rick take u
planet 9 hell planet 9
place im
fine cloud n thats cloud n okay
pluto ninth planet dwarf
planet planet got
got im fine im
fine know um something else
thing thats
called planet n9 um uh
indication data may
something even
solar system thats tugging
asteroid
there region called
kyper belt uh there lot
asteroid beyond pluto um
irregularity distribution
object suggest
there something tugging
um little speculative
could right could wrong uh
know idea go
search see youre
right wrong know would make
better data whats
object
right mean youre youre
saying youre seeing object
gravit supposed
gravitational field would
influenced youre triangulating back
object must maybe
much mass one
spotted object yet
real right think indication
something far away
little difficult detect uh
know jury set definitely
uh know get idea
put forward forward hypothesis
go test thats
science work interest getting
click im going say massive
alien
ship he going agree
im sure thats zero im afraid
okay
rick think done go
really im amazed
havent done uh show
quite time yeah uh
demand oh way dont know
anybody know get call cnn
right something solar
system call rick say rick
know enough
know bring
conversation super cool he goto
planet man love cuz galaxy guy
speed dial
laughter
cuz im im galaxy guy large scale
universe guy planet like
whole thats different specie
astrop know make
different get go nice
right dont v know
going black hole center
galaxy anything right get oh
wonder object send
probe like thats thats thats
damn near experimental science nice yeah
planetary science scientist
really put line
hypothesis
idea send probe
find wrong um
thats pretty exciting youre wrong
actually relearn
youve gained really great insight
thing uh dont prove
uh might expected
love challenge able
study thing go
uh find youre right
wrong today cosmic perspective
clear among interesting
point knowledge wisdom insight
weve also learned scientist
discovering universe isnt
valuable researcher
discovering universe
also work youre looking
music
job cosmic perspective
rick thanks show man
pleasure great love
family uh chuck yeah always good
man always pleasure
right right star talk
hazardous asteroid edition neil
degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist keep looking
music
