call prime number
value universal think meet
alien specie come earth
dont know language theyre
mean word prime
start tapping like two tap three
tap five tap theyll
like got got got
theyre tapping glip sorion
sequence wow exactly exactly every
field there little bit
doubt thing really
separate math thing
doubt
truly rigorous proof
star talk neil degrass tyson
youre personal astrophysicist got
chuck nice chuck
man oh man im feeling great neil
professional comedian cohost
thats correct
order sometimes sometimes order
chuck think gonna part
going cosmic query
yes lot cover
going full cosmic query
going
let slip
subject math language
universe learn math kid
language universe lang want
talk universe learn math
learn math there one
funnest expert okay
subject name grant
sanderson grant welcome star talk
lovely thanks
yeah studied math
college came worked
uh con academy oh gosh
youve never seen academy know
youve never like logged kh academy
go learn
everything everything
care learn dont
slap textbook
completely different experience
would call even joyous learning
practically every subject
learn
fail learn look
head clinching fist
going real opportunity st trek
reference
geek enough catch right
grant multiple math platform
like podcast uh blog youtube
brilliant posting
million view
trivial math youre like
real say real mean
kind math people would walk
say dont need know
dont want know got nothing
yet somehow turn
table ask
first question chuck want ask ask
first question yeah here
first question uh grant um
may sound bit glip im
serious hell math okay
hell ser
hell math hell hell
math okay here ask
youll get bit context okay
one started saying hey
language universe hear
time think
im like right
symbol weve attached value
symbol value
concept surrounding value
symbol came another
galaxy wouldnt know freaking
math universe universal
language well okay reminds
little question came um
another form wedding
recently person meeting
knew online math stuff
said sincerely like geometry
math different question
youre asking sort get
like even mean
math initially
answered saying something
know precisely one
oldest text math ukids element
one thing
start laying axiom saying
assume thing true assume
line thing assume point
thing assume point
thats line possible
draw line thats parallel
sort thing five
assumption prof
rigorously prof thing
true beyond doubt every
field there little bit doubt
every field youve got little
thing back mind
asks experimental error um asks
maybe didnt observe
thing really
separate math thing
assuming agree axiom
everything else doubt
truly rigorous proof
alien might use different symbol
ultimately thinking math
uh grabbed whoever
capacity logical thought
raise question like
axiom like start mean
sort different
math like youre
undergrad math major um take
course like group theory
topology whatnot always
start saying here here
definition im like here
definition group yada yada
set added stuff look
like gobleg proceed forward
prove stuff think
reasonable question student
could always like
object starting
could construct sort
object move forward
inter play relates
world whether math
youre developing useful
think take like
purely logical standpoint
develop whole bunch useless math
fact may know could ask
math developed
like maybe never useful um
history strange trajectory
thing seeming seem
useless coming back useful
real deep question
there mathematician math
theyre pretty sure
never useful well yeah mean
rather famous
mathematician hardy um
around time world war ii
writing u book called
mathematician lament sorry
mathematician apology cah hardy one
teacher ramanan remember
cor yeah one um
answered ramanujans letter like
brought great
mathematician played uh who
actor film jeremy iron think
jeremy iron fact uh
love archive dig
jeremy iron interview oh talk
film played party
mathematician uh get
reflection whole
story meant im sorry pluging
ar one favorite actor
combined one favorite people
history like oh
bait cant believe
havent listened mean
hardy wrote sort
delighting fact math
never certain kind math
highlighting know theory
prime number relativity never
used instrument war um
irony looking back um
know prime number lot
cryptography relativity
everything know gps
everything
idiot didnt fact
delighted little strange
right something would
expect academic maybe
like even even theyre
trying make useful right even
one trying seems
kind come back
question chuck know
math said
thing know sure
doesnt really feel satisfying
somehow doesnt tie
bizarre fact also describes
world would add film
contact book film
alien first communicated u
using pulse yeah
prime number lot special
sequence thats probably simplest
special sequence
another use prime number dont
know anything prime number thats
going say let let say
instance um call prime number
uh value universal
think meet alien specie
come earth um say like
know prime number dont know
language theyre mean
word prime start tapping
like two tap three tap five tap
specie done like
thinking theyll like got
got got
natural sequence like soon
counting number
start ask curious question
intelligent entity going stumble
like prime thing
clear assumed count
base 10 okay doesnt doesnt
yes
youre tap twice
number write number
yeah call number got
okay would write one three
maybe different base 10
13 tap
17 tap right keep
prime like know ai alien
going
agreement like one important
theyre tapping glip sorion
sequence wow exactly exactly yeah trck
know prime number
run alien
right hate ask
question dont like
question ask uh ill
tell dont like minute
uh math invented
discovered well okay forgive
asking question
super common question let let
let example rather like
philosophizing okay one first
substantive theorem student learn
school pythagorean theorem
point whether weve
forgotten since many u
come across
right triangle label two
shorter side b
longer side c matter right
triangle squ plus b square
equal c cool fact um
obvious true
useful let make sort
measurement first one
meet doesnt like fall
definition interesting
ask like
fact invented discovered
initially feel like well
discovered sure go
world see right triangle kind
measure waiting
see notice
waiting see
get little math
start ask question like
space know threedimensional
space twodimensional space thing
like one way
mathematically youre defining
twodimensional space rather
saying oh preexisting thing
put coordinate system
lot math start
coordinate saying
pair real number rather
saying like oh there plane
inexistence put like
ax say x
coordinate ycoordinate
get point space say rather
tricky philosophical
question plane
whatnot say plane pair
real number thats
math forward
like make proof whatnot
say whats distance
two point assign
call metric space way
telling distance sort make
pythagorean true theorem true writ
define metric
make true there choice
metric could put
start become kind
sticky like wait minute
discovered anymore
math
say know plane pair
number thats mathematically
dont
like oh waiting
discovered wait grant different
described knowing
there variety space
pythagorean theorem appli learned
curve
space triangle different right
triangle angle sum
180 degree traditional
triangle especially right triangle
come exactly 180 would
different metric
space yeah mean idea
put different metric sort
superpower
mathematician right youre
constrained non ukian
geometry discovered
well say used physic
youre thing sphere
thats fine
relativity stuff really made
come course right
back forth
something one moment feel
discovered like kind
inspiring truth another moment
feel like baked
definition longwinded
way answering simple question
asked math invented
discovered like like think
specifically think go
discover stuff based
existing either world
existing math use discovery
inform definition next
step make discovery
next step use
discovery inform definition
basically youre
saying math discovered way
columbus discovered
america thats
basically define
west indie

deeply respect um
part way many educator
dont necessarily prioriti dont
want put word mouth
correct misrepresent
dont dont put priority
learn math relevant
life right thats typical
way math teacher would approach
worried teach math
relevant people like
ignore get bored go sleep
two question one
probably agree math
subject people say
hardest
subject get around
making relevant people
life first um think anytime
there discussion education
pair idea
explanation different education
idea like making youtube
video making explainer
different task educator
classroom eliciting something
student youre playing
different game relevant
answer think
relevance table within
know one hour able
explain piece math like
actually touch someone life amazing
run thats inspiring
thing someone see useful
sort friend
hated math um lived bay
area lot programmer
came love math
programming
computer science saw hey
graphic project guess really
need understand matricies also
stud computer science well
college yes lot like
social circle fear
thats story ive seen many
time here bit
usefulness made someone
finally like thats great think
often utility
table given piece math
soon want teach high
schooler quadratic formula
say ever going use
honest answer student never
n time 10 never never like
might never never ever
okay
made mistake uh giving
talk pixar use
example like quadratic formula
youll never use like
motivate way
afterwards graphic
programmer come theyre like use
every day theyre like used
approximately trillion time
produce movie coco im like okay
okay fine like yes yeah yeah
careful say pixar people
there there mathematically
scientifically literate folk
working pixar yes um yeah
given people never theyre
never going use say like
learn could say
simply worth learning right know
spend time learning thing
there there something
mental exercise rigorous thinking
pure mathematical
setting really flex
muscle going useful
elsewhere mathematician go
okay yeah self serving
like think better analogy
want tell student
learn like go
football player theyre gym
theyre squat
say youre never going
field like know 400 pound
shoulder youre like lifting
particular way like
building muscle um think
lot math school
motivation youre
saying youre going use
like particular thing
way field youre
going like literal squat
muscle built like
really make powerful later
also math think often
taught art simply
available like
get someone bought beauty
inspiring
utility often done right
table utility
given constraint say like 20
minute online explainer
clear ive seen ugly math day
put ive seen ugly
painting right
doesnt mean
cant tell would count
information theory mathematics 100
yeah make
well part im saying
something describe exactly
oh thats started
conversation prision calculation
value used information
theory ive told help people
worble yeah hows even like
work well first
dont know saying
information
theory everyone else chck yeah mean
know people
listening right like
mean information
theory um answer question
chuck way talking
project neil referenced back
think 2022 whenever wordle became
incredibly viral like english
speaking internet one time
got sucked programming
project say like would write
like bot play wordle
clearly something
bot could play fun
programming exercise
thought actually
really nice motivating example
explain information theory
general public youve got
game lot people like um
first thought
go involved idea
information theory like oh
help motivate answer question
chuck um often situ
like youre playing wordle let say
want know better play
first word um nature
game get letter
letter part true word
youre like secret word youre
trying get theyll show yellow
theyre wrong spot
show green theyre
right spot game like
using previous guess get
information true word
might there word
information uh worst
worst starting example um
could use word kayak k
k um like exact sense
worst starting guess yeah
im already seeing right
thats suck as word youre
youre described
rule described
like worst word like
odds there
word like likely
odds k word
likely youre hitting many
vowel sense
youre learning much
word way valuation scrap
letter track much yeah
rare letter higher
value okay okay go ahead think use
word information heris
sense idea like learn
lot something versus dont
learn lot made
actually rigorous um clever
guy named claude shanon working
bell lab around 1930s
1940s know youve got
game try send information across
telephone line like youre talking
someone sometimes noisy um
might ask oh like
boost signal add line
like think
systematically well
communicate wrote
paper um thats like seminal paper
whats known information
theory first one use
word bit paper um
first time bit concept
ever came basic idea
like let say there
something there two way
might go flip coin might
head might tail soon
see result youve learned
something like path
universe took two
possibility know said
youve learned unit
information one bit let
say like hundred
possibility learn specific
one somehow feel like
youve gained information
came formula quantifying
used formula
like relative try describe
much signal send across um
something certain amount
noise made
theoretical limit
could say
much information could try get
across clever clever coding
scheme could try reach limit
context worldle
mean put number
basically good starting guest
based um word like
shannon entropy like fancy
word basically average
much information expect get
kayak terrible shannon
entropy context um word like
slate actually good got
e got l
common letter even going
show end still
common letter um basically
know made video giving
walkthr using information theory type
concept trying motivate
concept way
like pursuing little hobbyist game
writing bot bot play wordle
here one dont really hear
much important
would central limit theorem
central limit theor actually
important like overused
like perceived useful
utility um
there lot thing world
seem distributed according
certain normal curve here
mean dont seem
right mean seem
well actually
good fod discussion let take
height human height um think
little bit dispute
go measure whole bunch
people height measure height
height thousand people
million people create
plot know uh bucket
maybe inch something
everyone who 5 foot n 5
foot 10 fall one bucket everyone
know 5 foot 10 51 another
bucket people
demographic let say well
separate men woman well country
um notice there shape
kind bulge middle
taper either side
sort statistic
see shape seems
bulge middle taper either
side know
there lot shape could kind
bulge middle taper
either side there precise
function use seems
describes really quite well
even different situation
got funny formula look like e
negative x constant
thrown idea thats
formula make
exact prediction like saying hey
many people percentage people
think would taller 64
percentage male would
know shorter 52
sort question limit theorem
explains curve
curve like curve come
importantly explains
actually going come
opposed maybe
um false cousin seem kind
look like way
itll happen lot
different event youre kind
adding together way
pristine platonic example uh
um normal distribution would
something like let say
stand outside going play
game flip coin
head take step forward
tail take step back
play flip coin maybe take step
forward flip coin take another step
play game
10000 friend
youre flipping coin
time half take step
forward half take step back
roughly flip dont know 15
time youre stepping
got lucky took 15 step
forward typical person know
maybe took like seven step forward
eight step back
look everyone
follow normal distribution
perfectly um really really closely um
idea
took certain kind
random event flipping coin
adding result many different
time critically event
independent coin flip didnt
influence next one whenever
bunch independent thing
youre adding together
obvious always
tend towards
universal shape didnt
coin flip could
random process little
internal distribution always
get idea adding bunch
random thing independent
land
universal shape reason
saying like seems
waffling little bit
think there lot time
statistic people assume
somethings normal actually
normally distrib yeah yeah like
assume ch normal
question youre one
thats
say assume something
would follow normal distribution
yeah especially come
longtail event yeah got ask
real quick go forward
im thinking picturing
almost kind make sense uh
distribution youre
tooking coin fp coin flip
said random let take 10
white marble put bag
one black marble put bag
people play exact
game number pick
youre telling
distribution going represented
way
5050 um yeah good
precise let say pick
often youre picking white
marble one 11 time youre picking
black marble play game
make 20 pick theyre
independent
still see normal distribution
different mean
different everyone taken
many step forward back
theyre definitely going shifted
road clear everyone
he mathematician used word
mean may mean average okay
average yeah yeah average position
different mathematician
house uh standard deviation
stern distribution like get
take step im mean
distribution take step damn youre
loser actually sful
question insightful question
get thing
didnt mention like okay
literally distribution
theyre point space
theyll shifted road
might like spread little bit
however curvy shape
draw top
specific function thats e
negative x2 thats arbitrary
function couple parameter
tweak tell like
center much spread
two different parameter um itll
itll still itll still match
thats real surprise like
course thing going
change like wheres center course
spread going change
surprise like thats thing
somehow every everything else thats
interesting specific know
ball bag example get
washed away way
fluctuation cosmic microwave
background early universe
hot cold around average
exactly distribution give u
information happened way back
earlier big bang quum
fluctuation would led
powerful uh mean al average
number prime factor take
giant number ask like many
prime factor
average bunch giant
number normally distributed
show different
spooky spooky much yeah yeah
spooky yeah also think there
regression mean thing
two smart people theyre
smart combination
whatever happened life
baby likely
smart baby
smart therell
regression back mean everybody
else work way
biology im saying
trying trying uh create
depiction im baby
whats
happening one thing go
qampa uh let let dont give
shout fractal tell
aandal bro set h love good man
br set one
one image really capture
leave home without one let
say um year star talk
geekiest thing ever
said right love
mandleur wrong
oh man depends much detail
want one version
simply tell people go youtube
search like mand br set deep zoom
simply look gawk shape
think way lot
people engage really
really intricate shape matter
far zoom there always
detail found um thats
thats cool right whats cool
mathematician perspective
really really simple rule
used describe even though
producing mindbogglingly
complicated shape rule basic
stop boring like
much detail uh heavy
lift start
talking complex number
one term like sound
complicated
literally use word complex
way number usually
think number line
there really natural way
number live two dimension
choose point two dimensional
space there number associated
thing like multiply
add number
normal normal mass operation normal math
normal math start
point basically say right
im uh im going call point c
like constant c im going
play game start zero
im always going take square
add c example
start 0 squar zero add c
get c youre like great im
going im going
square number c squared
c one would one squar
add c
like two play simple game
almost like youre youre
calculator youre pressing
button enter
done something like happens
repeat operation sometimes
process blow infinity sometimes
seems stay bounded bounce
around color point
plane based two thing
happens color black doesnt
ever run infinity kind
bounce around whole bunch
color color go
infinity maybe even give hue
based quickly run infinity
simple rule
write like three line
programming language simple
set rule produce
mindbogglingly intricate shape
show complexity doesnt
emerge complex rule possible
complex phenomenon emerge
simple rule think
thats thats thats powerful idea
way manab br modern person
right born
died born 20th century
mind yeah 20th century think man
like like 70 think yeah
yeah worked ibm think um mean
first name ben beno benwa mandel
found mandal brock
lived born 1924 died 2010 wow yes man
time yes indeed cool
zoom see new
detail informed previous
detail saw smaller
small well thats
thats classic famous depiction
fractal yes
celebrity fractal know
know alist actor fractal
everyone want call
thinking fractal since
defined simply complexity
look like term
information theory little
information associated
remember active
space briefly people wondered
use fractal represent tree
image space going model
forest versus land know uh
nonarable land
abandoned
nature actually
detail fractal fractal
like lazy way look like make
look like detail
people computer
graphic theyll use fractal
fractal idea give something make
look like nature without
use lot computer actually
okay hear
mandle br joke okay tell joke
okay probably know okay
benoir mounder brro middle name
heard one right go
ahead benmar mandel bro course
okay heard course
heard thats good thats
thats good correct im gonna
guy oh correct correct
misr go go well thats
version know think
hold little better middle initial
b everyone refers beno b
mandel brro youre answering
like hey b stand
well stand beno b mandel
brro oh got youre
constantly feeling
b okay got thats f
thank shortened
memory didnt hold full joke im uh
going let know um uh
resident lay person uh
comedian uh funny okay
uh im joking joking hey star talk
fan dont know know
audio version podcast
actually post week advance
video version get
spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic st talk chuck got
question patreon
supporter absolutely exclusive
access question flow
guest today
way might first
mathematician guest im im almost
embarrassed say feel
little bit um hesitation
word mathematician dont im
research mathematician um often
like hold certain high esteem
okay okay ill word
respect concern oversell
okay might first
person weve truly love
math okay yeah know brian green
going upset
statement oh thats true okay yeah man
yeah im going call
physicist yeah physicist
matter okay okay right
let go way
patreon patron thank much
yes thank let go
um hello dr tyson mr sanderson lord nice
hugo dart rio de janeiro
brazil sixyearold daughter
olivia huge fan star
talk uh mr sanderson new
possibility evolution ai
present visual representation
mathematical concept
revolution area taking place
take place know
thank ai touching math
basically question yeah
pretty interesting way
couple different avenue one
using ai sus conjecture thing
look bunch data
something mathematical lot time
um human come
conjecture guess
might true yet
prove use instinct
say seems like might true
maybe try prove
work deep mind um
essentially
computer try generate whats
interesting math deep mind google
correct thats google yeah yes yeah
thats one avenue there
avenue math lends
exactness like wed
describing way also lends
computer well
phenomenon emerging really kind
last decade notion proof
cheing software write
theem rather writing english
write actual programming
language check sure
thing true example
get lot like real
mathematician get email
people claiming proven
famous unsolved problem normal
thing email
ignore uh like
normal way like real proof
would would get surfaced proof
checking software would mean
basically say hey
actual proof write software
well run software check
know worth looking
interface ai
interesting way want
teach ai math um
generate whole bunch proof
automatically whatever write
special software whenever
compiles whenever software check
know valid
ai kind reinforcement
learn one
kind like play chess
play game
get better
trillion trillion
iteration math
way cant field
there thing called
international math olympiad um
went year great fun
every country sends six high school age
student basically went
contestant high school
student say old little old
math olymp
giving lecture student
yeah
uh uh one first
year um company bot
try answer question
quite hard question theyre
written proof theyre theyre
like inter number kind thing um
ai deep mind
developed got score thats
equivalent getting silver medal
um international math olympiad
thats like people didnt think
would possible um like
considered like
requires creative thinking
wrote mechanic um seeing
level creativity reason
possible could
game letting computer play
sense using
sort proof checking software
short answer um friend
rio deano like yeah there there
lot interesting interface
ai math corey say hello dr
tyson mr sanderson sorry chuck
dont like im mentioning
put
didnt
mention cory san bruno
california use base 10 still
leaf u lot irrational
number number system
would make irrational number pi
rational first uh used
live san bruno hello cory oh
really um one answer
question whether number
rational irrational nothing
represent kind
alien discussion earlier
matter language using
base system using idea
make number rational irrational
intrinsic number
property
description number
um maybe slip
help
uh pi irrational
transcendental base
pi would 10 one z whats
irrational one z word rational
mean represent
fraction whole number
counting number 1 2 3 4
represent something fraction
base pi counting
number pretty natural object
youre counting rock
world would wild
description take whole bunch
different wouldnt call digit
itll force everything else weird
weird state also clearly
well find mean base pi
um like symbol
use base 10 10 symbol
youre using represent base
four four symbol youre
using base pi like
entirely clear nonhole number
one symbol one symbol
go
laughter
forever okay youre right
made piie nice even looking number
everything else relative
die
give give smooth life
make pie look smooth make rep
yeah thing thats
irrational could say
relationship pi number
one kind like whichever one
make look natural
youre sort
fact
relationship two um
property number yeah
answer answer
know basically youre
going able make pi rational
without making everything else know
kind weird
representation rational go ahead
yeah tendency blather
definitely stop go deep
aside talking base
talk represent
irrational number
used writing
decimal like pi
31415 effectively youre saying
three plus 1110th plus 41
100 plus one 1000th youre kind
adding like power 100
there way could try
use number represent irration like
use whole number counting number
represent irrational value one
want throw ether
like curious listener go
like land wikipedia page
want um idea continued
fraction another way
use like sequence number
counting number describe
irrational thing ive nightmare
continued fraction oh
know maybe turn
nightmare dream seeing
certain value like um golden ratio
um e look continued
fraction rather whole
bunch arbitrary seeming gobbledygook
digit see really
really natural sequence somehow
want different language
describe number like continued
fraction offer another language
expose regularity certain
irrational constant even fact
theyre irrational something
cant see kind kind
strike uh talked
beginning conversation
useless
math gave nightmare write
cant write whole thing
fraction spill
page true um
decimal value like cant write pi
31415 still pi 314159 youre
saying im okay
okay continued fraction dont
know mean theyre award like
layout use vertical
space kind like right right
grows keep going yeah
think need representation
irrational number uh number
dont believe earth round
okay sure
yeah right time
question right go
alysa feld ho rocket city
huntsville
say black hole math
may missing see end
result beyond event
horizon like let let
let flesh even
limit theory
universe general relativity
limit known advance
cannot describe singularity
black hole singularity big
bang gravitational
singularity said god
divide zero youre
supposed strength
theorist march rescue except
havent rescued anything yet
point say grant
missing
physic new physic help u
point might
say come guy give u another branch
mathematics save u
ignorance fair
retelling question think
might like retelling im g
im gonna throw flag feel
like one little pay
grade term um like know lot
specific insight around um
understanding happens event
horizon know
one fruitful area
seeing relationship quantum
mechanic general relativity um
specific im im going
pretend mind fully wrapped
around say like ah here here
insight get u
one step maybe neil
provide little bit um
intuition think broadly
idea alternate alternate
mathematical tool understand like
specific part universe feel
like ripe area um
progress happen lot new
physic happens boundary
uh observe
observed know singularity give
something thats quite literally
boundary think history
new type math come
describe new physic
even old math thats describing new
physic right like quantum
mechanic founded people started
using bunch matrix algebra
like matrix hadnt
existed utility
hadnt known
deal imaginary number quantum
mechanic existed
utility found similar
thing might happen whatever
step one want make
might existing math um
hasnt yet found utility
try use get back work
help u yeah yeah exactly
chuck got time one
question one right
frosty tennessee dont
know speaks whats dont
know he got accent uh
dont im frosty
tennessee guess name like
frosty he got coming thats yeah
man frostys cool he never mind anyway
uh say uh many mathematician speak
beauty mathematics would
explain beauty someone
might view math purely functional
plain difficult
id like add
insight many people
find math difficult almost
like civilization
people like math thats 1
everybody 99 people
hate math worth subject
never never well
never intuitive
educator space taken
think lot whats happening
thing school
pretty distinct mathematician
find beautiful theyre referencing
theyre
looking thing one type
person find beautiful
99 dont looking different
thing school often
youre implementing like
procedure learn procedure
adding twodigit number youre
like elementary school learn
procedure solving x learn
procedure taking derivative
time along thing
people find beautiful
different level
elementary know
usually calculus like highest one
high school might teach
still procedural thats
there nothing wrong like
thats necessary part
thats thats youre
squat gym right building
muscle thing
beautiful unexpected connection
seeing like hey saw bit
math show corner
bit math showed
completely different spot um mean
pi really good example
pi show sort place
wouldnt expect
throw one quick example um
something maybe anyone
understand least surprising
even maybe dont see see beauty
right away take one minus
third end somewhere
