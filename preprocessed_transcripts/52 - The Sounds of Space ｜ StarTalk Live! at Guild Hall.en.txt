tell wavelength
frequency whats going
light kind like byproduct
hurly burly frisky puppy kind
energy matter right might
look chair youre sitting
think solid motionless
youre peering atomic level
youre actually able see
movement atom im looking
chuck he maybe 2t away dont see
see
two billionth second ago
believe im chang man
data sonification
different element
mapped color instead
looking visual going
hear mapped
sound please welcome
stage personal astrophysicist
host star talk neil degrass tyson
applause
welcome thanks warm welcome
tonight topic dont know know
advance titled window
universe everything ever thought
didnt know window
universe youre going hear tonight
clear going talk
james web space telescope
xray telescope even going
see extract
sound data space
going see happens
one world
expert evening
bring let introduce
cohost chuck
nice good man every bud
right go thank thank
going introduce
official expert guest evening uh
shes author expert ast
visualization bet didnt know
word
beyond astrov visualization
dimension called data
sonification welcome stage dr
kimberly aran kimberly welcome thank
hello hi right youre
visualization scientist thats thing
thing
accident field astrophysics
make way page book
headline front page
article
think cool content cool image
youve taken even new height
call emerging
technology lead yes thats thing
thing chandra telescope
center astrophysics
cambridge uh ch telescope
specializes xrays instead
taking infrared image like james
web chander look xray light
super high energy light thats
universe okay well get
back lay stage
principal investigator
nasa universe sound data
sonification project yes okay
yeah okay right
author yes
stunning book light visible spectrum
beyond uh
expensively produced look
expensively produced book
congratulation effort
coauthor megan
watsky megan watsky who megan waty
science bestie writes
press material chander
observatory shes awesome okay
uh might wonder till
met kim data
ification dont sort
give taste well dig
deeper moment check
music
real data real data real
data basically calm act
universe yes know funny weve
actually people approach u asking
like meditative version
use apps yeah
alien wanted human
okay human hum alien
xiety problem maybe yeah right
get let lay
groundwork
page speaking language
right brief intro
telescope
electromagnetic energy live
space look beautiful
image universe
fundamental thing front
able tell u
know example
object far away im
looking chuck he maybe 2 foot away
dont see see
two billionth second ago
believe im changed man
letting know two billion
second ago two billion second
ago im telling awful
thats like much time go
universe course time
delay much much greater
factor saying
think happening
versus whatever happen also
seeing
universe telescope
eyeball would receive receive
information eyeball
sensitive call visible light
yeah visible light love
visible light visible light
compare rest
electromagnetic spectrum
tiny portion like youre
piano play middle sea
couple key either side thats
visible light rest
88 key thats everything else
missing world
eye suck
yeah awful eye best
best didnt know
discovered band light
outside spectrum yep there
there fun story
discovery infrared right
outside red william
herel mhm newton laid
spectrum red orange yellow green
blue violet asked question
separate great
mind like everybody else
wondered color different
temperature took thermometer
put prism light
coming there like
rainbow table put
thermometer color
need control thermometer right cuz
dont dont know whats
happening thermometer also
happening ambient air
put thermometer side
spectrum light
red there nothing
put thermometer
go check compare
discovers hottest thermometer
one light
coming 100 thermometer later
mistake
concluded sun
sunlight coming prism
must emitting light quote unfit
vision first
description discovery
infrared infrared light infrared
later cant see infrared light
cant atmosphere
trans par visible light mm whats
best evidence
think think uh fact uh uh
see sun yes yes good going
limb guy good one chuck yeah
broad daylight see sun
yeah exactly see visible light right
come come
atmosphere atmosphere
good band
challenge
overcome right like earth
super protective layer thankfully u
right right mean xray light
cant get mean uh
ultraviolet radiation get
right there
thing
launch telescope space earth
atmosphere atmosphere
absorbing layer yep okay
band dont make
visible light make
sensitive visible light
nice matchup evolved
star sun atmosphere
earth exactly would cruel
sensitive like microwave
something nothing came mic
blind reason
eye suck reason eye
suck hubble telescope one
great observatory
launched saw kind
light mostly optical also little
infrared little bit ultraviolet
okay hubble remember
hubble telescope still launched
early 90 yep stupify
remember losing breath every
time saw one image
published one early
one tell u
hubble deep field
beautiful
didnt really think anything
right pointed telescope
period time wanting see
would happen blank part sky
blank part sky knowing
theyd get
teaming stuff right
galaxy far far away
whole glimpse
universe never
hubble really set stage
fact observing effort would
never made telescope
allocation committee oh right
lot thing right need
time play right right right
ciity let look exctly
see whats see happens
yeah apply want find
empty spot sky stare
dont
dont really need grant government
permission right right
done director
observatory
foresight director forgot
10 15 there percent
total allocated time called
director discretionary time
director whatever want
whatever director want 15
something 10 yeah something
depends lot though think
limited time telescope
paved way cuz
telescope thing knowing
theyll rewarded set
stage
director want director might
see proposal little risky
everyone think risky
say let yep pick
people research resarch yeah
yeah yeah thats made
image know
cuzz let tell something
guy
coones youre like mean
think he like okay want
take telescope would like
look nothing yes exactly
powerful
tc subscribed lot like everybody
want use hubble right take
time look nothing nothing
turn something yeah
like poetry ri gamble
cuz would known right
looking blank screen
dumbest man nasa ever right right
right came
reminder nearly everything image
entire galaxy outside milky
way there couple star
little spiky spiky feature uh
hubble deep deep field forgot
long exposure
seeing galaxy way edge
universe happy
well would say
chander came along two
james web space telescope came
jam space
okay let compare hubble see
james webb one
iconic image eagle nebula right
talk u two image yeah
love hearing oo
audience youre best audience ever
okay looking beautiful
area starbirth right tall
column column gas dust
theyre teeming new baby star
formed
see hubble image
relatively deep image left left
right see there really
darth star see
clump gas dust
stellar nursery kind
look almost like attached really
kind connected look
field view james
web space telescope
seeing like sparkling star
right capture
sparkling amazingness youre
also starting see like
little newborn star
really bright red patch
see well youre
seeing inherent structure
tall pillar gas dust
star forming
population star around
star may born nursery together
kind grow go
way youre kind seeing
happen think
pretty awesome infrared
good infrared like
able see thing right
kind like well cant use
xray analogy cu im going use
later able peer
different way capture
entirely different kind phenomenon
type lovely hubble could
see gas cloud right
looked like there much right
dark area sky
pull jwst cloak
transparent though looking
window glass screen
like cleaned window right
yeah okay know uh infrared
ability look tell
wave length frequency
whats going light kind
like byproduct hurly
burly know frisky puppy kind
energy matter right might
look chair youre sitting
think solid motionless
youre peering atomic level
youre actually able see
movement atom right
light product
activity like photon packet
energy kind like leaving scene
crime there collision
charged particle
example um youre trying
characterize light youve got
frequency wavelength essentially
picture um small pond
steady drop stone
pond cause beautiful
rippling steady drop
stone keep constant u
little exercise youve got
beautiful ripple going
beautiful speed youre going time
essentially time take one
ripple make point
going give frequency
youre going measure many
ripple per second exct go
youre going measure distance
two ripple peak
giving wavelength giving
two really important characteristic
understand low energy
high energy looking xray
light looking infrared
distinguishes xrays infrared
wavelength light right
theyre form energy
right give full list
electromagnetic spectrum
starting coolest weve got
radio typically associated
temperature well youve got
coolest material sort
longest youve got hottest
material typically going
sort like really high youve
got radio youve got microwave
youve got infrared youve got
tiny little puny visible ity bitsy
right red orange yellow green blue
violet mhm youre going go
ultraviolet
xray gary
beautiful expanse
different kind like like
different tool tool belt
pull time want use
appropriate tool dont want
use hammer screw something right
want use appropriate tool
youre going try look
exploded star aftermath want
use xray light want look
know advance
thats high xrayer phenomenal high
energy phenomen going high
energy light exactly want
look like ancient ancient
galaxy want infrared light
james web space telescope wa wait
thats thats special case
special case okay galaxy
given brand new
galaxy give u infrared
youre watching infrared right
happened well
universe expanding thing
stretching kind change
everything unfortunately yeah one
brilliant feature james web
want look early universe
galaxy born birth
galaxy rich favorite
high energy except since
universe expanded light
universe got stretched
longer ultraviolent xrays
red shifted far past visible
light infrared tune
james web infrared get
watch galaxy emitting
ultraviolet even though theyre
infrared universe
medium theyre riding stretched
like car
turned stretch limo
infrared see
go step
actually use different kind
light together example recent
headline james web space
telescope chander observatory
worked together find
farthest black hole using xray light
infrared light found
galaxy infrared light
looked like imprint
xray chandra together using
older tool newer tool time
able find earliest black
hole like 13 fortunate coincidence
infrared part spectrum tuned
see birth galaxy
kind light see nearby gas
cloud yep look star born
exactly combine infrared
x xray gamma find
marvel superhero think youll
definitely find hulk nothing
else dont know anyone operates
xray besides superman well there
thats dc right non marble superman
dc correct forgive saw didnt
want god know know
yeah youre noticed dont get
marvel dc universe right im
reminded one character
star trek next generation jordie
jordie jordi le fors there
character name played lavar b kin
yes lavar bergen oh im sure hed
happy hear
root back 1970s
kint dude look facebook
page picture
kint remembers ro okay im
sorry im sure like lavar burton
done everything show business
somebody walk im
like right character lost
vision yeah outfitted
visor fact acronym v
r visual instrument sensory organ
replacement enabled
previously blind see every band
electromagnetic spectrum must
chaos whats
say good im
thinking really want see
would glowing infrared
cuz body heat id seeing
cell phone uh lit
microwave see radio wave coming
would got tell
sound pretty dog cool
maybe much much information
im one
smoke
marijuana clever
writer clever
part character
show think
ability sort tune oh like know
could select think wasnt
copy could actually like picture
episode 213 act dont lying
know
believable wasnt
minute said know
episode 2113
werent many episode
show youre absolutely correct
jwst see birth galaxy
see birth star mean
birth planet made ingredient
life give u
access
stardust made oh
tell u chandra telescope
designed
sure sure named first
actually named
brilliant nobel winning prize astronomer
um astrophysicist um
indianamerican named suban yan chandra
sear love actually
naming little contest nasa
held almost
many yes lot
student wrote teacher write
winning entry subaman
yan two winner student
teacher separate way together
um want become astronomer
actually really love sort
symmetry anyway
chander get look high energy
universe get look thing like
exploding star get look
thing like galaxy get look
thing like cluster galaxy
reaffirm thing involve
high energy phenomenon yes xrays
high energy light right like
said chair occasionally matter
barf photon matter high
energy going barf high
energy photon yes exactly
universe really simple barfing
photon think mean feel like
could book okay
um something guess know
write
people buy especially young
people im telling right barfing
photon im want go get
right yeah thats pretty good thats
pretty good okay ad 1054 yeah uh
july 4th uh universe celebrated
american independence star
exploded recorded chinese
yes uh today observe object
sky crab nebula yeah named
cuz looked crabby yep
seen regular telescope
come along put
xray telescope
find um crab nebula
beautiful example happened
really massive star start running
fuel collapse essentially
explodes
gut universe
happens crab neutron
star formed neutron star like
super dense like like teaspoon
material probably weighs
people planet right
super dense creating
beautiful ring jetlike structure
there antimatter
matter kind collision stuff going
youre seeing essentially
result chander actually able
said casually matter
antimatter yeah actually sounded
like star trek second
like yes marvel
universe something like
clear tell everybody
antimatter put
page particle
essentially mean explain
guess okay yeah could mean
matter antimatter counterpart
predicted discovered
last hundred year way people
alive today alive knew
antimatter real
thing became science fiction
favorite source fuel um every
particle antimatter counterpart
universe creates antimatter
routinely happens center
sun happens particle accelerator
uh film angel demon oh
lik one yeah dan brown second
novel series report
catholic church oh thats right
isolated vial antimatter oh
pope walking around
vatican vile anybody
pope looking like
cherish thing nobody else
world like dude
lab time
special totally forgot
saw scene like nah
call antimatter
like bring together right
annihilate there matter
left
pure energy energy energy wow yeah
thats high energy anima
animatic getting high getting
xrays g youre getting high energy
thats list
thing going crab crab
crab nebula thats crab
nebula actually exc
due respect doesnt look
like crap cra know
know know think
op ial image look object
invisible light maybe crab light
structure ill honest still dont
see thats thats thats
came cuz im going say thats
thats kind like
constellation like know look
constellation let honest
like youre like people hide
dont see bear yeah dont
see bear dont see crap dont
see guy bow arrow three
88
constellation barely resemble
theyre supposed rest requires
high imagination three oh
orion good yes orion good uh
thats hard imagining belt okay yeah
okay uh leo lion good lion yeah
yeah give lion okay b
big di constellation thats
asterism
asterism liked
like audience participation
fact
fact fact way
dont act like yall didnt think
big dier
thought everybodys like oh
yeah look ne got good
know dog well thought
constellation okay point
asterism like kim said
interesting subset star
make constellation uh look
like dipper yes thats
name constellation big
bear handle dipper
big bushy tail bear bear
dont tail okay
okay maybe bear bear
cooking
ladle know
maybe bear cooking pot
right see see see im
saying could drawn bear
differently would using
utensil kitchen yes thats
ancient thought right
back xrays yes yes importantly
going list trigger
detection chandra high energy uh
collision pulsar uh neutron
star yep dense keep
going list uh right
get thing like cluster
galaxy example yep there one
right one ables beautiful
chander really good detecting
case cluster galaxy
essentially ten hundred
sometimes even thousand galaxy
bound together make cool
chander say hot
make hot chandera
like bath hot gas
envelops cluster see
hot gas colored blue
image behind u gas part
one galaxy right seeing
immersed bath word thats
think gas bath g
gas bath galaxy gas bath
thats pretty cool right tender get
looking like
amazing know even though
chander built 90
essentially launched around
time starting understand
exoplanets chander get
look exoplanets chander get work
uh james web space telescope
looking thing like star
formation star theyre
first born theyre cranky theyre like
cranky toddler right emit
like flare xray flare
whats useful
cranky star
exoplanet born nearby cranky
star impact
possible habitability planet
useful understand like
star tantrum ear like okay
said something
builtin fact want make sure
everybodys clear would high
energy xrays anything
possibility life exop
planet flare
star high energy xrays
right xray light going towards
young planet perhaps
super uh protective cover like earth
atmosphere
incredible damage even
atmosphere powerful
enough xray flare still
lot impact negative way
life could potentially form
understand uh molecule
foundation life
well presence xrays
radiation great okay first
realized getting xrays
dentist yes always wondered
go outside room close
door flick switch
switch like isnt
right next cuz theyre
10 time
day still said there something
going go
neil told could sketch
teeth yeah dont look inside dont need
want hear
chandra detect especially
realm black hole want first
hear explore challenge
making xray telescope
regular optical visible light telesc
there lens there mirror
focus light magnifying
glass microscope there
there familiarity
item culture
xrays whole another another yes
whats going right
xrays really interesting
theyre energetic cant
normal flat mirror like could
hubble example um xrays
essentially absorb kind
like uh fire bullet
wall itll boom wall right
like gun expertise
file fire angle right
whats called grazing angle
ricochet
thing xrays
essentially create really nest ted
barrel shaped mirror kind
graze xrays long
distance sensitive detector
end otherwise
cant capture order
mirror
interesting barrel shape
kind skim multiple mirror
row mti graze one
incredibly smooth like
atomic level like took
colorado sanded pike
peak would like less inch
tall like truly like smooth
process honest think
might still smooth mirror
ever produced day well ive
still got get colorado
color youre saying colorado took
whole state smooth break
rockies going right
made colorado smooth
mirror onra chra pike peak less
inch pike peak one
surface state colorado
also super clean
way take like size
go new
york yeah could see
take something like size computer
monitor could one teeny
tiny speck dust entire size
clean
coated aridium
make sure like xray light could
focused dense metal
dense yep dont want
xrays busted exactly like
bullet wall dont want
create smooth
process xrays go 30 ft
sensitive detector wait minute
30t spaceborn telescope
howd get well
size school bus
packed really tight space
shuttle h best sent
pack tight like luggage
literally squeeze underwear
missed best part statement
hoped best well
mean hop best young
shuttle suitcase
kind treated one like
barely fit dont know
designed use available
volume yes like 100 actually
made flight astronaut
bringing risky
heavy payload abort
scenario actually become less positive
dont know see
know less like dont want say less
likely yeah know know theyre
screwed yeah yeah chander
problem launch chander
still board come
back would
challenging challenging
drop atlantic mean um
cuz wouldnt time
empty um also go
arm like
loosey goosey know
mean like pair glass
rattling around suitcase yeah
yeah theyre screwed yeah yeah okay
worked worked amazingly
beautiful worked perfect shout
engineer work closely
scientist make work yep
scientist inventing
like everyone astronaut
mission controller everyone like
point yeah oh give
couple example sorry believe
requires
usa yeah good one
usa well know like
olympics okay know
okay olympics space baby
still gold medal mean could
take moment national pride xray
astronomy created u like
incredible expertise
day like chander still
highresolution xray detector
impressive thats
1990s talking 30 year
yes 25 year
launched last month wow yeah
yeah excellent know god love
country working center
astrophysics cambridge
joint title harvard
college observatory
smithsonian government smithsonian
astrophysical observatory remember
im old 70
xray astronomy born yes
yes earliest xray detective
didnt good resolution
wanted detect whatever
yeah remembered challenge
put upon design engineer
payload couldnt big
heavy earliest xray
telescope miniaturized xray
detector right around time u
congress say want scan everybody
walking airport
weapon well going
xray detector
portable xray came
astronomer mh youve got one yes
people day
pioneered xray technology
first landed every airport
united state yeah 1970s right
whole company created
american science engineering
ricardo gone yep nobel
prize nobel prize effort
xray correspondence
moving frontier engineering
astrophysics application
earth fascinating backstory
keep going modern time give
example yeah uh like
mentioned chandra really challenging
technologically build
technology invented
create chandra mean
like today uh cuz many
clever people know recycle
technology create
spinoffs right today im
getting mamogram like technology
made high resolution
lower dose chandra an
xrays xrays im gooing mri
example low dose magnet
use thats chandra
environmental monitoring like shark
population improved
x shks yes environmental
xrays way
monitor im
oceanologist sharkologist dont
know word know
neither word exist thats
know youre neither
make friend
oceanologist listen believe
actually uh tried pick someone
bar told
oceanologist clearly working
marine
affair chandra technology used
study population thing
like shark
could sort algorithmic
tool tactic needed
astronomy
application right thats definitely
part mean like
really hard thing like get
like get improve thing
thats really cool yeah
know gave u airport xrays
possible chandra could
fix tsa thats asking much
chander chandras got lot black
hole look left
pulsar neutron star
high energy place uh give let keep
going okay black hole talk
chandra actually became black hole
hunter whats really interesting
actual scientific point chandra
first xray
astronomer looked sky
like sea xrays everywhere
chander created resolve
called xray
background one first
thing chander found
wasnt c chander
brought sharp focus found
mostly black hole early
detector couldnt xrays
coming somewhere
like taking glass know
see haze well bad
vision take contact
thats chander take
glass blur
would think there blur
light right boost resolution
say well there source
light exactly right chandra
chandra found billion
billion black hole black hole
black hol one mostly
black hole stuff
course wait black hole light
escape black hole yeah uh
actually seeing know
black hole yeah great
question try
sl okay actually centaurus
active galaxy
bright white spot
center essentially area
black hole youd zoom
super super deep actually find
black hole ho thats
active black hole mean
weve also got jet high energy
material streaming well past
like dusty disc center area right
black hole center
powering like amazing
energy youre seeing back
question like see
cant see black hole well black
hole know kind sitting
thing lot
going theyre ecosystem
right stuff around
black hole black hole might need
snack asteroid nearby
kind fall
gravitational pole might
little small xray flare there like
big massive star chomped
black hole youre going get
much bigger xray flare
burp cause sort cool thing
chander see fed
disc accretion disc exactly call
accretion disc
middleaged may
matter
gather spiral toilet bowl
style thats place thats
ecosystem guess youre talking
right matter
there matter available consumed
got confront accretion disc
get black hole
exactly youre saying thats
action
action like thats downtown
probably seen like
first image black hole
event horizon telescope example
mean never thought would see
life time ill honest like
amazing get see
silhouette right
describing seeing shadow
black hole chander see
every black hole
sits environment
vacuum right weve got stuff
around stuff kind
tell story black hole
acting
eating sleeping like
black hole right kind sleepy
call sleeping giant
one milky milky way
every big galaxy got hole
exactly right kind sleepy
say ill take
word um mean like black ho
mean good place though
right dont whole lot going
super bassive black hole
thats cool something like
centaurus awake
superpowered blasting
intense amount energy cuz there
lot happening right even
though everything want get
black hole
got work way
everything make way right
there much activity
there action actually spew
matter back right
coming black hole
right coming ecosystem
around around exact thats cool
isnt cool okay understand
also detect dark matter
yeah dark matter fascinating right
one thing love astronomy
like humbling like know
nothing know nothing
think universe like
jelly bean jar 95 jelly bean
going black theyre
representing either dark matter dark
energy unpopular
jar right dark matter sort like
thing hold thing together
dark energy something thats like
pushing thing apart thats kind
like think 5
jelly bean going
colored like normal stuffed jelly bean
like one want eat
dont like black licorice one
like cherry one whatever
white coconut dont even know 5
thats universe dark
really interesting
chander started looking
cluster galaxy right
bay hot gas um one
particular im forgetting
scientific name abel something um
nick dame bullet cluster clearly
showed normal matter
essentially dragged behind
dark matter say like
gravitational information
getting dark matter youre
describing bullet cl bullet
cluster youre directly
detecting dark matter youre
invisible
essentially map pull
gravitational lensing give
like use wine glass like
look light kind bend
bending light use
tool map thing like pink
stuff normal matter thats
bionic matter thats like stuff
made example um
blue stuff map dark
matter dark matter doesnt
really interact stuff way
normal matter see
blue
collision two massive massive
cluster galaxy least
time energetic uh event
universe
big bang um blue matter
see ahead
collision normal matter like
air resistance know there
drag something see
kind stayed behind
there problem dark
matter doesnt interact like
keep going
lensing there huge history behind
lensing albert einstein predicts
intense gravitational field
dark matter would right would
distort image galaxy
background youd see
effect almost like fun house mirror
would evidence there
still lot gravity even
matter left behind right
exactly ripped two apart
right technique kind
showed work first
direct proof theyve
applied like dozen dozen
cluster galaxy since saw
thing make sure
page planet
around star star joined 100
billion star milky way
there 100 billion milky way
theyre evenly
scattered look find
many clustered
cluster galaxy cluster
star within galaxy cluster
galaxy described two
cluster galaxy collided yep
yep passed dark
matter kept going regular matter got
left behind exactly isnt neat
crazy crazy crazy yeah crazy
cosmic
vocabulary yeah youre gonna take u
away weve
showing u picture
thats even specialty
specialty else
picture yeah data
sonification yeah motivated
convert visual image sound uh
love data like im data junkie
right im always trying figure
scientist going
working problem like kind
way need data order
figure might new way
thatll offer u like new avenue
opportunity conversely im also
thinking people like want
experience data friend
mine wanda diaz shes astronomer
computer scientist shes blind
since teenager talk
school
professor would writing
blackboard couldnt see right
like math equation something um
later went develop
technology essentially take data
translate sound thats process
data sonification us
study star understand stellar
characteristic uh another
friend gary foran astronomer
thing us
sonification able study
galaxy example goal
take data creating
chandra telescope
well mathematically map
something could hear
see like would happen
especially pandemic
little time like play
know mean like well werent
event werent whole
lot like much
changed bored wouldnt say never
would time think little
differently get sonification
dont know love way
came sound like data
satification serve
vision impaired might offer
element interpretation data
even cited yes
like another tool tool
belt right um particularly think
different kind object like
variable star star thats like
changing frequently enough human
map get lot data
variable star human sense
sight youre looking
chart data changing time
little bit challenging uh
human sense hearing really good
able pick
variation right also train
become better listener data
there research show
tool scientist
also way understanding
youre blind low vision
joy project work like
think data sonification
lot different um
call dimension queue
there color would
like frequency wavelength
light there also intensity yep
right whole thing yes
thats even color
bright dim yep
right there loc
image sort
separately trackable bit data
access
right right decide
would best serve need mot
right scientific
story thats embedded data
youre trying essentially communicate
try figure right
best way communicate
exploded star sound
radial mapping youre going
trace essentially shape
exploded storm cass yes
example thats yes okay
tell u cass yeah cass
exploded star leftover de
debris field star
exploded gut
universe oh want say cass
sure
cass
constellation who queen
ethiopia egypt african
country copa wanted find
big w sky yes
would actually love one
asterism w otherwise aone right
okay name
find object within star
track constellation exactly
first okay pick
chander looked object
many many time hubble space
telescope recently james web
telescope well see
like look electric right youre
looking color coding
object actually telling
chemical composition able
detect chander
two detector also like
grading essentially uh capture
fingerprint light dna
chandra chandra
long exposure uh
2 million second okay know
there many xray photon
universe right
look got wait around
got patient could
guy ever could apply
need 2 million second worth
abbing time going say
ever uh speak term hour
minute actually
interesting target chandra
great spot sky
chander look
called calibration target
use make sure everything
board telescope working
beautifully time
scientist propose
also time check
like engineering issue well oh
got clarify copa
whats called circumpolar
constellation closer
north star youre orbiting
earth half sky cant see cuz
earth way
star near pole get
see much longer period time yeah
said almost
continuous view would
great view chandra mean
chandra go third way
moon still lot
stuff way right still
worry sort thing
great spot chander
able view
okay get deep view okay
experience
right going listen
mentioned chemical element right
there iron thats like
purple there silicon there sulfur
there calcium different
element mapped color
instead looking visual
going hear sound
lowest iron youll hear
sketch readily center
neutron star leftover core
star exploded go
kind tracing expansion
debris field well hear
start go iron silicon
calcium sulfur way
bright blue rim
essentially bright like shock um
sweep
material around blue rim made
uh electric electron
okay one
element specifically
highest energy shock
material okay supernova
yep know supernova went
think 400 year
ago like 11000 light year
away know old
relevant earth time space time
yeah actually happened 11000
year ago coming
cave okay inventing
agriculture saw saw uh
well might tracing seeing
kind one unclear
one yeah 400 year okay
let check yeah okay let listen
music
okay sounded like philarmonic
warming tuning right
tuning begin
exploding star yeah
debris field left barfed
gut place would
thought
like well hearing
leftover part leftover
know really important communicate
iron example like
lowest note youre hearing
whats cool explosion
right exploded iron would
core right
heaviest element could produce
explosion explosion
along perimeter tell
star actually turned
inside exploded
cool youre listening
know technique
listen well hear
lower sound really pick towards
perimeter im realizing
need trained know
listen sonification thats
different trained
learn look image right 100
need astronomer tell
well
happened provide
caption kind help yeah
also separate piece
hear individually
actually learn listen
yeah got got another one
uh karina nebula yes
one favorite jwst stunning
cant argue one okay whats
going happen one
listening beautiful area
star formation called cosmic
cliff see
really cool gas dust
towards bottom james web
picked youre seeing
young star
recently birthed starting
like mature stuff one
broken little differently
actual star formation area towards
bottom distinct
visual kind empty space
star top
divided two piece
youll hear difference
top bottom star
sort like cy cl piano uh let play
see description make
sense
beautiful yeah know
say dont think ive mentioned
actually work people
blinder low vision create um
really first
desired targeted audience um
people obviously enjoy
well like wanted make sure
somebody listen world
around made sense people
blinder lision otherwise
right go home right
exactly go home guy ever think
uh starting radio station
would really cool space
gas cloud get telling u something
different star point right
exactly youre getting like whoos
texture dust
gas star formation area
youre hearing individual star
picked dont know clickity
clacky like thing
describe im sure there
musician could find find something
better know
differentiation understanding
really helpful one distinction
course youre cited see
whole picture audio
track give time scan across
either left right case
center edge found actually
really important im glad
brought look
im used looking right
someone who visual found
learned thing data
looking dozen year
im listening time
know spoon feeding piece
slice image time give
time think else could
happening ive actually learn
digest process
different way love thats
possibility something would
improve closed eye oh yeah
think activity like maybe
next one listen one
okay let okay whats next one
maybe listen first
describe something
little different okay
next one v404 sig think v44 signey
v sound like variable star mhm
yeah
actually black hole stellar mass
black hole one smaller one
got companion star
kind pulling material
cause
outburst light kind
like dont know bounce gas
dust ch area around
causing light echo youre seeing
light echo ring
xray light youre going hear
think distinctly close
eye yeah let close let
theyll fun
music
feel like like meditation
class right yeah yeah yeah yeah
image like emphasize
place sort
concentric ring emitted
gas explosive episode past
slowly move another
exposive episode there gap
another
sort episode therell energy
wave thatll overtake yep
render visible right
kind like know youre driving
fog light kind scatter
weird way thats thats kind
seeing youre able
kind trace timing burping
black hole way
really cool gas dust
ricocheting thats kind
sound trying mimic
hearing almost sound
like ocean wave feel like
appropriate hampton yes
determine sound
aix going ask data
yeah thing
whole team work um matt russo
andrew santo musician matt
astrophysicist um also work
christine mik consultant
blind well science
like story putting together
trying make sure
authentic possible data
mathematical mapping
data like using python uh
process youre essentially
selecting programming language
programming language um youre
selecting sound hopefully
differentiate object best
also describe science best
pacing let process
data best pace
thing test wow
rogue back room
conductor yeah yeah
dr dre know fun though
would yeah hiphop
dont yet maybe thatll change
yeah hiphop mean say
black hole there got hipop
somewhere
dark matter dark energy
fit hubble deep field yes
anyone crazy thing
chandra look middle
nowhere crazy thing
chandra 40 day 40 night looked
one patch know
looked patch sky
um found
beautiful field black hole
look like youre looking star
image actually deepest
xray image weve ever captured
really special youre trying
describe like someone
flecked like paint onto black
rectangle right doesnt necessarily
communicate excitement
science like think like
awesomest image ever um
going dot
page dot page cuz theyre
black hole thousand black
hole highest concentration
black hole looked
cuz cant see xrays would
filled star galaxy
galaxy yeah right chander
detecting high energy anything else
right jordie focusing
xrays see black hole
black hole everywhere black
hole bonanza scienti
exciting image never really
expressed important
one sonify um think
actually tell story better
going listen scan
bottom top
actually stereo
black hole essentially colorcoded
energy thats technique often use
image processing uh lowest energy
material color ced red
highest energy material
colorcoded blue medium
green kind going
thing sound
weve taken red encoded um
lowest note weve done opposite
blue highest youll
hear population black hole
think unique way right
dont otherwise know
somewhere brighter others right
dont know highest
frequency okay let check
music
yo
jail thats one thats favorite
one right kind
viby vi yeah oh thats number one
bullet baby yes like listen
population thousand
superman black hole like billion
light year away part right
youve heard sweep
field think
pretty fun beautiful oh
yeah pat methen yeah
kind like indie thank p indie
vibe there like four
talking thats
think
yeah highlight
youve talked
bullet cluster right one
going scan left right
uh xrays believe like um whoy
sound come better
descript ive
realized youll hear star
distinctly youll hear um
strong kind like note
dark matter map yeah let run
one see think mhm
music
mean whoy sound dont
know else describe dark matter
didnt know hit right right
one one scifi
bit scii scifi scifi
black hole deep field im sorry
agree one favorite yeah
tool show u thing
already know right uh star
galaxy especially high energy
universe enchants uh
there thinking
might detect dark energy mysterious
pressure vacuum space forcing
universe accelerate
wish gravity know
dont know represent
there also neutrino there
ghostlike particle move
universe unimpeded difficult
detect
perhaps frontier await
effort oh thank um think yeah
sonification useful tool
type thing mean remember
ligo neutron star merger story
come gra wave moving
universe there famous
sonification took data
translate sound
reason know youre looking
image light case
use alternative
tool represent analyze
make sense think there
lot like weve started
working hap ification using
example phone youve
got mute like im sure
get text youll get little
vibration right hap
ification um thats haptic
haptic there
vibrational affirmation something
happened exactly
learning essentially harness
able represent image data
dat well dont know
thats weird kind like
example whether
phone telling got text
message silently press
button feel little
vibrational haptic like yeah
give response like
pressed button right thats
idea right like using
sens able try extrapolate
um data
something im super excited
yeah way
visualization familiar u
whether embedded
virtual reality augmented
reality another variant kind
mixed reality yes exciting
issue like scale
right thing like extended reality u
mixed reality augmented reality whatever
might youre using remind u
augmented reality augmented
reality youve got like say oh
snapchat filter right youre
youre adding layer reality
reality uh virtual reality
like deeply immersive youre
virtual reality um
combination well astronomy
know kind picture
distant future uh one
colleague cambridge
kind data analysis black hole
theyre working someone
japan real time theyre able
step object virtual
reality know pick reality
choice right theyre able use
sonification uh check variability
black hole perhaps whatever
might like
combination able process
data understand data
always wanted movie theater
yes would cool
movie happening around yeah
walk closer bar
called life meal
guess youre right okay cant
argue
3d thing well youve big 3d
printer lately yeah im big fan
yeah 3d model
create science
scientific analysis right
understand red shift moving away
something versus blue
shift whats coming towards
map 3d representation
object take
move 3d printer
hold version
hand clear
figured get distance
anything sky imagined
sort inside surface
spherical bowl right would make
everything distance
one one thinking 3d
anything universe
3d information get work
3d printing represent
3d print hold version
hand great youre
blinder low vision want tactile
exploration data give
another avenue
exciting people uh
exploring cited
still value right 3d space yeah
actually cpa first one wed
ever done using observational data
3d model like super exciting
u 3d printed
response fantastic
fantastic well excellent want see
continues go uh
future future xray
astronomy yes chander 25 still
amazing health engineer
ground like far fix
cant like send astronaut
fix anything
take chander doctor
coding right astronomy run
coding brilliant job
reprogram youre
reprogramming youre little
tiny fix uh
example need look different
kind object reprogram
bit whether fortran whether
c additional
language fix
python exactly yeah give
prolonged life give beyond
ever imagined
supposed 5 year 25
um there expendables like
fuel stuff like
concern floating
degradation talked
photon bouncing barrel
would assume even photon might
little bit effect like
dripping water rock honestly
concern uh
sensitive sun close
like issue like
much could warm perhaps
kept cool order
observe capture xray
photon sun always kind
offering bit danger there
lot fix uh know
pointing tilting
observing given time
engineer clever figure
best way keep super
efficient ground whats
future plan yeah soer
new telescope
going coming board um
athena one european mission
coming 230s hope
doesnt still quite resolution
chander however hoping
europe oh hoping plan like
super chander right like next
generation chander temporarily
called link mission um idea
provide even larger area
collect xrays even high def
would dream come true
thats thats brilliant look
forward reporting yeah
youre something none
u ever met anyone
knew
job like mommy well
explain hey id like
offer reflection evening
content look arc
science progress science
century
almost every case advance
understanding universe
arrived presence clever
device clever new way prove
world around u people
think
content previous way
decoding world eye
enough ear enough
find another way
reveal universe talking
place previously
ignored clue even existed
leaf humbled
presence could still
discovered
universe like william hersel
happy red orange yellow green
blue violet thats whole world
oh gosh there another
branch electromagnetic spectrum
little know exercise would
continue 100 year
saying little kim know there
whole way look
universe back 2024
practically blind whats missing
understanding universe
forcing u blind 95
jelly bean canister
know theyre dont know
theyre made take
occasion celebrate far weve come
reflect much farther
still need
go cosmic
perspective beautifully said thank
gil
hall chuck
nice kimberly aran
im neil degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist always keep looking
