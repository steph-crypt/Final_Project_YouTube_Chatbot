motion change perception time
call relativity simultaneity youre
moving im see event
simultaneous see happening one
add
distance component see
different time could
third person moving
direction see different time
define lead
idea
two different there
there always there illusion
close together
small speed light
make feel like
doesnt really exist larger scale
there
music
thing star talk neil degrass
tyson personal astrophysicist
got paul maio paul whats
man good see always great
back love yeah youre
comedian got show broadway
broadway traveling
broadway broadway
roadway road
permission speak onean show
interact audience stuff
yeah yeah story
people uh frank oz directing
frank created yoda try directed
yoda he never wrong well
going cosmic quaries today yeah
love oldag old colleague
friend mine
h get last name olash far
away way resarch let
give nemonic think oh
shady oh shady instead
l ui hakee u yes sir go
got podcast
great conversation awesome book got
bio great astrophysic
cosmologist youre previous guest
star talk three year back
recently like practically minute ago
ceo ast rical society
pacific ask minute
didnt know sweatshirt
ceo youre looking good man
man taking ceo vibe
another direction right pretention
yeah dont need congrats man
thats awesome appreciate sir thats
awesome man absolutely thank uh
got podcast fly
roddenberry entertainment jean rry star
trek fame youve got memoir
year quantum life
keep getting released unlikely
journey street star
thats book talk
show thats right reminds
quote oscar wild
gutter u looking
star thats good didnt know
thought could put
book could put
book could book
could call next time unless
youre drunk thunderbird youre
looking star youve
also involved nasa say imap
satellite yes nasa shortage
acronym unpack imap
interstellar mapping acceleration
probe cant wait talk
okay well get like minute uh
astronomical society
pacific im big supporter
like way back say
sound like pacific
mission statement thats
functionally international getting
people look yeah try
every day right youre succeeding
okay youre succeeding right cool
kid know wasnt
uh cool nerd right nerd
cool science everybody love space
plus
blur right thats true nerd there
way black nerd there two
trust least dont
know yet theyre oh
give list right oh
secret meeting
like public guy black
nerd
yeah society black physicist nerd
special subspecies whole world
okay cuz cuz people ask
kind nerd come
different elk right isnt
one general type nerd science
nerd like tv nerd like kind
thing yeah well know first
question difference
nerd geek right here
thing got got geek
geek specific category
music geek right okay
youre music youre
necessarily associated science
youre geek right youre geek
youre thing nerd
say something personality
behavior thing
care quality personality ill
give example navy
back 80 guy asked yo
come youre brother
dont wear hella gold answer
never occurred
said curd mean
like couldnt even tell difference
know like dude love car could
tell two car apart like know
yeah care care
different thing care
different thing exactly yeah yeah yeah
uh vision
society pacific absol
pacific well one
remind people organization
promotes public awareness
understanding astronomy level
amateur level get telescope
thats right turn pacific thats
began san francisco first
president director lick
observatory known america
first oldest national astronomy
organization lick observatory
observatory santa cruz yeah
yeah yeah bay area used
observe supernova back
day postto great place
drink know go bottle
boom eat chip got eat chip
observatory um asp one
thing made different
founded egalitarian perspective
accepted professional
astronomer amateur astronomer
educator level
sort lifting
everybody together level
like know yeah include
better knowledge highly laudable
fact high laudable fact doesnt hang
riff dont make slap later
last added new group
labeled enthusiast good yeah yeah
here thing
discovered join went bay
area 91 graduate school
guy nearby
community college name youre going
recognize andy froy yes
ce teaching community
college excuse yeah teaching
foothill foothill yeah thats right
im looking mercury magazine
im looking proceeding thep
produce magazine public
mercury magazine produce
proceeding scientific
conference got everything
probably one book exactly
conference know
else 90
astronomy uh journal world pasp
typically 15 20 90
astronomy journal theyre typically
top around 177 astronomy
journal go proceedes
yeah book every meeting
astronomical society
pacific every professional meeting
proceeding yeah
beautifully published line yeah
two relative others
different part
shelf galaxy evolution milky way
perspective yeah made
film starring tom cruz jump
milky way uh covered vaseline
amazing equation equation
mean hundred mean
around long time oh
absolutely good hear
thats right saw
rigorous scientifically rigorous
organization social
consciousness educator train
nobody else
professional organization w
even talk public exactly asp
everything care
professional scientist fulfilled
mission society
picked part
mean know
good example inclusive
answer probably answer
answer field yeah
arent many field reach
enthusiastic amateur
still participate well show
cosmic query perfect example
im saying thats astronomy
astral physic cant really
physic really well
cant youre pompous like
harder everybodys
looking know discover
supernova black hole anything
headline yeah splitting atom less
relatable many science
make headline frequency
think yeah true many
family scientific
instrument use professionally
like people buy
telescop thats im saying yeah
good luck sometimes
need little bit ab youre
helm important
organization thank sir
tell latest nasa
acronym yes interstellar mapping
acceleration acceleration pro
cant thing say imap
word mapping middle
yeah thats thats thats bad
working going
redo word word
acronym cant one word
acronym like g mr
smart alec g unix gnu
oh yeah g lenux unix guy arent
old okay never mind white
hair here thing
he nerdy enough working
satellite called supernova
acceleration probe im working
interstellar mapping
acceleration pro youre working
earth related
use word yes okay
awesome word
acceleration probe
essentially happens sun
accelerates particle right creates
bubble examp solar wind
solar wind right moving fast
supersonic right heliosphere
hit wa wait wait wait
mean supersonic moving
vacuum space space
exactly vacuum oh approximately
vacuum timately vacuum yes yes
okay cool moving faster
speed sound would
reduced vacuum exactly
happens know
almost like boundary information
travel one way thats
heliopause isnt
heliopause im getting
like example thats given
showing much
let catch
find two
comed guy science
done thats thing know bomiz
first put know
run water faucet
make there ring
right thats like heliopause
go supersonic
subsonic heliopause
interstellar medium here
thing previous satellite
guy who running professor
princeton named dave mccomus okay
dont know remember
ulysis satellite went po
sun didnt went sun
went pole sun
got see solar wind around
mid latitude regular
wind 400 km per second pole
highp speeed wind 800 kilometer per
second didnt know young dave
mccamus guy made famous
plot right okay
idea idea crazy let look
neutral atom coming toward earth
outer space look neutral atom
look photon look different
h nothing boring neutral
atom nothing boring
ionized
here origin electron
sun go hit
heliopause there magnetic field
there ion trapped
magnetic field electron get
captured ion become
neutral like like neutering
dog
okay well anyway ion
ionized tied magnetic field
stuck
becomes neutral longer stuck
longer tied magnet field
charge
charge stream
inner solar system get
map stuff magnetic
field raining back
discovered look
galactic magnetic field wrap around
bubble perpendicular
like radiation belt
around planet belt around
helops nasa go thats
interesting let satellite
look way detail
study sun thing go
make tiny discovery yeah
open whole yeah open
build entire experiment
disc
anticipate might find
mean must se
unknown exact
thing know youre going find
something never seen
like ibs right
theyre looking acceleration
sun theyre looking acceleration
magnetic field theyre
testing interstellar medium
made cuz particle also
stream thats
interstellar mapping acceleration
probe donald goldsmith who
astronomy writer cowrote
original cosmos actually
coauthored book origin
uh uh llc company
writes book writes
tv called interstellar
medium inter medium interstellar medium
interstellar love thats great
simple llc qukar
okay thought one would think
turn there lighting
company west
coast porkar right here little
bit heady though well
cosmic query yes
cant like shoot forever
right right james
h english greeting he denmark
read recently universe
expanding fast theory
model fit increasing hubble
tension think problem
model physic
havent discovered explain
ie rate constant due
undiscovered property spacetime
something wrong data
model model trust
data need new physic
data model
definition
maybe spent time princeton
lot theorist say
never trust observation unless
backed
theory well thats happened know
two case observation made
fit theory ill give
simple one art
walker research first got
image see pretty image
sun plasma loop art
first right plasma loop
constant crosssection
solar physicist like dude
there something wrong
telescope know magnetic
field diverge altitude
get fatter top theyre
getting fatter clear
magnetic field confining
plasma right shape plasma
shape magnetic field
he saying man field
constant crosssectional tube
something dynamic
top get
fatter right like look
theory said right art like
aint nothing wrong telescope
im going im gonna
pas bam im going give
three different configuration
telescope im going give crain
hellion richie crean cant
say optic
would fly 16 22 telescope
pas band ended
subset pas
band sdo eit solar
satellite show
nature issue
pas band issue
optic nature
thats everyone know
theory adjusted theory
adjusted right right
come mechanis
happen let get back hubble hble
tension right people article
there lot article right
essentially everybody want
throw big bang throw
dark energy click bait clickbait
yeah right exactly clickbait right
essentially whats happening
cosmic microwave background
radiation treasure
trove cosmological information
standard way
measure expansion object
know uh fast moving fast
moving away shift also
know distance based brightness
right make hubble
diagram fit plunk data get
value hubble constant dont
agree plunk cosmic
background pl satellite europe say
stuff dont know ill leaving
stuff man thats thats im
thats youre thank
thank yeah keep continuous
there new james webspace
telescope wait wait set stage
data early universe
get hubble rate get
traditional galaxy usually
supernova standard candle
two number match
match day measurement
expansion rate universe
differed factor two factor
two yeah yeah differ
percent right aab
bar error bar uncertainty
way smaller difference
two measurement right
severe fact knowing expans
rate universe factor two
similar problem
age star age
universe depends hubble
thing right
cosmological data
somebody found star older
universe right star
halo look like older
age universe right
headline oh catastrophe oh
god yeah yeah people like ready give
realize oh cosmology
need improved know
happened 90 really know
post kobe changed everything
cosmology right kobe bryant
kobe br kobe satellite mean
right game got 80 scored 81
point game game didnt
change cosmic background explorer one
first high precision measurement
cosmic backgroundin smoot mhm no
yeah yeah circling tension
tell whats somethings got
give yeah somethings got give
think there something
dont understand think think im
trusting measurement think
trust measurement look
good dont measurement look
good involved supernova
cosmology right also weak lensing
study looking structure
growth sort thing
different data there there
one probe right people
using different type star right
thats get confidence
one one data point
one telescope james asks
physic havent yet
discovered missing physic
adjust model well
people coming
model maybe expansion rate
universe like okay
there initial impulse right
universe evolves based
energy density constituent
three main one right
radiation stuff move
fast fa space almost
time matter move
fast time almost
space spacetime
energy density call dark
energy doesnt move either
one right initially radiation
dominates matter come dominate
dark energy ie spacetime energy
density come dominate think un
well thats thats think
right one look
expansion rate would
universe here thing
discovered higs particle first
time discovered known
scalar quantum field mean
right well ask
mean
dont ask question
thats u one one
thing look squ squ
dont need let go ask
question anwers need
ill query yeah read
let back united
state surely would discovered
higs ban oh yeah uh super
conducting super collider whose budget
cancelled right around peace
broke europe uh right 89
procurement yeah center mass
particle physic moved europe cern
large hydron collider
discovered higs b
happened here here deal
here bring
known scalar field
think field know
right theyre like oh electric field
charge electric field
magnetic field charge thats
moving generates magnetic field
gravitational field oh there
matter every field know
there source matter
come particle physic theyre
like oh yeah know every electron
identical dont say way
mine every electron
identical reason every c note
musical note identical
theyre real thing real
thing string air thats
vibrating right theyre invoke
idea quantum field
quantum field permeates
spacetime
nothing real quantum field
inations field particle
right permanent one
virtual one right
measure excitation particle
particle right here
happens though say oh there
thing called hicki
everywhere space
time right scaler field
source im like mind
young sciencetist im like real
discover ring damn
field create particle im like
wow oh inflation
look like allan goose creates inflation
look like universe rapidly expanded oh
know ill ill create another
scaler field call inflaton
field see dynamic
happening create new
field sound like youre
pulling stuff as
youre supposed like use
make prediction know test
whether came jump
thats
right sh testable actually
device ill bring
next show oh remember
list 90 oh like
joke lived
internet early internet
like different type
one bu felt came
wiped there nothing
toilet paper there nothing
toilet know happened oh wow
okay
okay people
theyre saying maybe universe
expansion rate hasnt
think simple think
could another question
yet another phenomenon acting
expansion rate beyond three
character idea
might weird quantum come
something yeah come
something weird sci ific term
youre going sure let
clarify notion
expansion rate misbehaving let
characterize way mean
doesnt match three
potent model would give u right
okay introduce fourth
accounting yeah say one
wrong right working
harmony
adjusted well there assumption
within well come
cosmological principle universe
isotropic homogeneous people
looking look direction
look direction look
direction expansion rate
versus distance every particular
direction know thats
big survey coming like uh ver
ruben telescope lsst
typically pencil beam survey
part survey dont go
lst large synoptic survey
telescope astronomer
dont like going way dont play
named one
one guy like acronym youre
youre laziest telescope
yeah discovered dark matter
milky way wow speaking know
another telescope thats coming
nancy grace roman n grace roman
telescope let looking dark matter
dark energy
going survey telescope everybody
know neil yeah nancy grace
roman going back asp valued
asp much passed away
recently left organization
million dollar w oh yeah yeah okay well
listen astronomer million
dollar ny grace roman million
dollar going jump next
great question james
going jump next one um adam
oman hi dr tyson dr ol adam
poland first first
big fan everything dr tyson
tyson involved love book
program he
question ability detect
various partic atmosphere
distant planet know uh
light altered travel
towards u exactly
happen
ooh absorption spectrum yeah yeah yeah
happens whats absorbing
happens look
uh transit exoplanet
mean itll go front star
right time light
star pas
atmosphere planet
edge planet yeah right
transit
planet moving across surface
dont see dont see
see light yeah okay im
getting light telescope
planet going front star
atmosphere light
star pass planet
atmosphere light interacts
atmosphere around ed right yeah
light interacts certain
wavelength light arent going make
side theyre going
absorbed right chemistry
atmosphere chemistry
atmosphere remember star
spectrum well get
spectrum star get
spectrum light passing
planet atmosphere
subtract whats left
spectrum planet ah
say oh see element
molecule particular atmosphere
constant
word proven theory work
every time well hard
james web space telescope built
job actually
succeeded job
early release like look hey
hasnt succeeded
badass badass opened
whole industry whole cottage
industry make happen yeah yeah
right right going go
jordan vina north dakota ive
curious dark matter
went denmark denmark poland poland
north dakota
dakota place ive never
okay may ever go right ive
curious dark matter
possible reason dont
understand dark matter
defies understanding law
physic meaning possible dark
matter something
travel faster light
massive gravitational effect without
large mass love show let
let shape another way throw
right lap probe
universe using method tool
science developed
day could dark matter simply
awaiting brilliant theoretical
understanding coupled
brilliant new kind telescope
would see way one
previously dreamt awaiting
technology awaiting new physic
think basic
going going plug
new kind particle
doesnt interact trivia
first physic research thats
wondering summer
91 cold dark cdms right
basement berkeley building
dark matter direct detection right
weve detected dark matter
phd funny
thing got accepted applied
berkeley stanford got rejected
berkeley accepted stanford
idot got rejected berkeley know
stanf would work
idiot go
here happened worked
berkeley summer undergrad
grad project end
summer said dude want
come berkeley come didnt know
stanford high flute school
didnt know wait didnt know
dude country man
inter smart guy memoir
called street
star part title
understand right thought
town connecticut university
didnt know connecticut existed
still havent seen anyway
town connected think
going along think
dark mattery stuff right nothing
scale galaxy larger
basically two 20000 light year
bigger g galactic arm nothing
move consistent law
physic there two way right
there like alternative gravity
theory know like
think theyre dead come back
theyre stronger ever
oh there stuff
dark matter oh got great idea
black hole
macho super symmetric particle
oops macho would massive compact
halo object come
better instrument two kind yes
dont exist look
theyre super symmetric
particle certainly saw
theyre point serious
go let stop looking like
move something else like
looking say like looking second
sock dont find
admit
stupid exactly
uncertainty ambulance
chasing theorist
slightest observation thats little
quirky theyre going come
whole theory understand maybe several
yeah right cu get right
call call
answer sort
never going stop
trying pursue theory
know something mess question
possible dark
matter something could travel
faster light theory
well
dark matter
kind matter call matter
dont know well
here thing know
two model
moving faster light two
model competing
hot dark matter cold dark
matter particle moving fast
would hot dark matter know
best model lambda cium cold
dark matter dark matter feel every
time read feel like
dont know like guy show
party something
make weird make
make thing axon
dont find well uh people
making particle thatll yeah
yeah well made particle
cancel electric dipole moment
proton exist right
quark electric charge
there separation minus
negative whats
called separation
call dipole moment one
measured helen quinn al came
idea maybe there
field cancel
wild west wild west
actually make exting come
idea go
know
whatever dark matter cold
warm yeah cant going
faster light exactly
would evidence give evidence
gravitationally right know
youd see imagine shrink radiation
right thats travel faster
uh light medium yeah
emit light
mhm dark matter wouldnt dark baby
go next one upstate new
york recently watched side channel
show hakeem fell asleep
really boring weird
would write david im guy
wake everyone youre best
man youre best recently watch
chan aem gravitational
wave wondering also alter
time huge collision occurred near
solar system would feel
would alive physically notice
damage first
yeah know disturbance
gravitational field everybody
know movie interstellar right
youre different
gravitational field youre going age
differently kind
consequence thats good question like
like perations time travel uh
good time bring
andromeda paradox okay thats know
thinking thing
andromeda paradox
well andromeda paradox fact
looking
andromeda andromeda galaxy
galaxy star constellation yeah
constellation strain
killed million people two
drive strin right two half
million light year away
happens suppose youre sitting
chair im running
second run look
andromeda im moving
stationary going see event
day apart even though
location looking
time think relativity
think
say relativity keep talking wait
scenario far away
youre running
place place
essentially youre like literally
ive never heard paradox
little paradox thing
see see day apart day apart
physical perspective
well here would think
would think light arriving right
receiving
light thats work motion
change perception time
know term local
universe call relativity
simultaneity right youre moving im
see event simultaneous see
happening one
right add distance
component see
different time could
third person moving
direction seeing different time
define youre
even though youre
place yeah sitting
im youre running look
drama time
seeing something location
seeing thing day apart day
apart lead idea
two
different
there always
there illusion
close together small
speed light make feel like
right doesnt really
exist larger scale there
thing always
seriousness
bias bias thats
thats galilean thats
backwards right
ive never ive never gotten heckled
left right
time thats right right wait
upshot
question cuz talking
time right theyre talking
something im like
gravitational wave
wondering also alter time
huge collision occurred near
solar system would feel
would alive physically notice
right curve space stretch
time right kind idea like
black hole right curve
space know time move slowly
relatively phenomenon
gravitational wave incredibly
subtle real calculation
type gravitational wave would
necessary like big order
happen happen
felt felt right
yeah one first one
measured jiggled
experiment 12 12th diameter
proton go aint feeling
aint feeling know
gravitational wave yeah measure
right know want
think event
magnitude wave need intensity
calculate sort event
event would surely kill
experience w
whole host infinite
number thing could cause
gravitational wave right mean wait wait
gravitational wave move speed
cant kill wave hit
would happen
time oh thats good thing add
thing oh well thats upside
dont even know dont even
know get compressed
nothingness get ripped apart
like scifi thing right
gravitational wave
anator exactly right going
move lightning round
absolut got great one
go lightting around dude know
mean even loquacious
yes exactly right right yeah okay
go ive always bothered
physicist preoccupation
conservation information especially
regard particle falling
black hole firstly sound like
philosophical position one derived
matics scientific method
correct secondly mr heisenberg taught
u one never know
information particle thus cant
consider information never
existed first place thus
cant destroyed one thing
allan allan youre going ask
question acid got send
tablet u
wavelength answer question
tablet go tab go he allan g
go ahead answer answer question
actually remembers 60
exactly live 60
shouldnt remember right yeah like
say say
information cultural
phenomenon nerd aint cool
try make something cool aint
cool right whole thing
oh know quant black hole hair
made bet man nerd shut hell
nobody care damn dont care here
here think theyre saying
right look sun take
spectrum sun clarify
said black hole hair yes
meant
matter becomes black
hole like three yeah
physical parameter like angle momentum
mass charge charge idea
whatever looked like
none later becomes
black hole say hair
thats back enough people hair
important part
identify bald look know
billionaire yeah exactly hey
speaking know something
realized know grew
segregated mississippi go
graduate school would play
basketball time noticed
sucked oh man
didnt suck joined cambridge
athletic club league age 49
suck okay 90 great
here thing noticed something
white dude
wasnt present youre trying
describe someone invoke
hair color yes didnt
vocabulary dont know
mean say like know paul
guy dark hair yeah exactly
yeah like china dont
dont imagine people iding
invoking hair color
person black straight hair
im invoke skin
color oh lightskinn dude red
bone yellow bone see
voice like know neil tyson talk
like james ear jones like
basically
cnn going move
point yeah nerd
thing let tell
unlike black hole take sun right
reconstruct made sun
thats know oh sun look like
three dozen supernova constituted
look made today
reconstruct must come
cant black hole
right thats youre
lost information camp black hole
clearly information there
much made information idea
exactly okay he coming
yeah okay give another one
go name ross live
madison wisconsin could dark energy
whatever mechanism behind
big squeeze analogy consider
magnetic field come one
pole fold back go
pole imagine magnetic field
fabric space time dark
energy point dark energy
making u expand never return
maybe meant dark dark matter okay
sufficient dark matter close u
back big squeeze oh
even close even close okay
one lightning answer right right
okay next okay
christopher st louis
looking cosmos possible
dyson sphere criterion using
tell difference dyson
sphere something else get dyson
sphere mind right
right right cuz little
calculation right go
ahead okay oh way make
clear people
want know stuff look
internet youre
scientist calculate answer okay
right gave someone answer one time
oh source use
education brain app try
okay try sometimes called
book learning basically youre
going enough matter build
dyson sphere took jupiter
tried make dyson sphere
around sun using idea
matter thats like taking
human eyeball trying make
sphere around basketball using
material youre trying harness
energy
star youre trying absorb
matter right convert
useful energy right
enough matter solar system
create something create something
put around
large enough cant hold
large
like star much bigger
planet seen garbage
bag costco cell put one
around star come guy get
let let add said
cuz brilliant revelation
regarding material necessary right
much material mean
youre visiting star system
would even interesting
excise dont even need
trying scooping thousand
planet thousand solar get
energy one star hell
hey guy already got energy
trying create energy
know sun already
dyson sphere know called
think sun think
star think two part
core envelope right envelope
damn dios sphere already
50 matter right 50
matter core 50
envelope absorbing energy
thats coming radiating
useful form could build
solar array capture let add
last year research
paper observing project look
dyson sphere wow know
theyre going theyre looking
red star system oh
theyre like theyre getting
energy theyre saying
absorb energy star
greater radius yeah would
yeah infrared infrared
theyre suggesting theyre alien
data set
there star
shrouded dust exact
thats exactly rebuttal
star youre dust
absorbs energy reated
radiator make star look red
ordinary explanation
red star experiment
got wrap okay say one
thing okay astro society
oh astros asos societyorg come join u
society pacific yes
may well soon
astronomical societ could
nerd could geek could
enthusiast could educator
could learner yeah
know give
want low donation
ask become member community
go money
man give go
leadership yeah
become astronomical society
planet think think
thing let tell thing
big thing going im
going take humanity look
history uh mathematics
here thing right big
bottleneck people getting stem
math right people go college
ask three question
choose major like
much math much money
make least
amount math right need
happen look
look historically look
four phase there early
phase let forget here
name library alexandria
thats know ukl
got pythagorean theorem
exists got basic geometry
go nanda city learning
arata brahma gupta gupta dynasty
right come place
value system numeral become
arabic numeral zero theyre really
hindu numeral thats hindu numeral
zero come exactly
right third step
house wisdom right
get quadis solving equation stuff
stem every day go
cambridge right right
newton right cambridge england
average human earth stop
ask math question
got first two step covered
need raise humanity arithmetic
little bit algebra exactly
trigonometry here
mean go average person
say hey whats two dog plus three dog
theyll say five dog whats two
galaxy plus three galaxy five
galaxy whats 2x cub z plus 3x²
cub z get face nerd
problem dont realize
cuz lear say get first
whip texas instrument bang bang
bang texas instument holy cow yeah
keep right next palm pil
go anyway want raise
little humanity hp join u hp 45
got kidra star
thing sund
go wait got stone
circle stone hinge got stone hinge
backyard got nap
plyer right yeah
peace yeah yeah hakee really good see
thanks first time
office planetarium first
time ive touched 20 year
dont sound little creepy youre
welcome star talk
cosmic query edition poe old
timey friend colleague hake welcome back
course paul great
right till next time bid keep
looking
music
