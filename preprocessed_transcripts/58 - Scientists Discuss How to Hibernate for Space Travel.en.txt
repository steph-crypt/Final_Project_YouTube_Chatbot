saying squirrel resistant
diabetes beginning
hibernation period increase
body mass 100
become completely insulin resistant
naturally reversible model
diabetes essentially thats
music
insane star talk special edition
since special edition know
two cohosts chuck nice chuck
man hey neil im great
thanks chuck weve got gary
oreilly right gary welcome back
thank always pleasure today
topic like whoa come didnt
10 year ago gonna talk
hibernation space oh dont sleep
subject
oh came early want
hibernation story gary set
scene put together
weve seen scifi movie
crew kind deep sleep
hurtling deep space um
going achieved turn
actually may look mother l
nature answer animal
hibernate month time
little squirrel big old bear
human want engage interplanetary
travel likely going
need hide hibernate enter state
torper get nonhibernating
animal u human hibernate
going need
expert um qe guest ryan spranger phd
senior research physiologist forum bio
phd zoology expertise
cardio pulmonary physiology also
expertise hibernation extreme
physiology think vital
component background
effect cardiovascular system
forum bio awarded nasa grant
niac program stand
nasa innovative advanced concept
study torper animal
space health stash plus
important thing ryan startup fan
make smart well cool
love ryan welcome two star talk
thank much im
excited
torper thats good question
torper define torper
field state metabolic depression
body temperature depression
sort quiescent state
body turned wait
depression biophysiological sense
neurological sense little bit
biophysiological sense
root also
neurophysiological depression
depressive state
emotional thats mean yeah got
dialing metabolism
body temperature essentially
body torper whats difference
torper hibernation uh
fun topic
discus hibernation conference
hold every four year uh
general field say
hibernation season
animal use torper torper
actual state metabolism
low conference
every four year hibernating
yeah yeah precisely precisely
well thats good science get done
well well historically taken
longer collect hibernation data
se seasonal
uh event yeah
limited window study yeah
cant go cant go bear
summertime like hey man
tired ti need tired
youve got youve got two h winter
one time one
different another might mean
depends feel like picking
bag traveling yeah well actually
thats year
decided shorten community
decided shorten conference
learning hibernation
cold season event
learning recently warm animal
hibernate uh animal warm climate
hibernate theyll hibernate warm
temperature um learning
widespread
thought
mean purpose
hibernation like im bear right
think hibernation
automatically think bear use
example
awake year long know go get
food pack uh
know calorie like animal
get lean time
whats idea know dialing
metabolically taking
long nap mentioned almost
question cost lot
thing really simple way
putting energetically energetically
cost lot energetically im
thinking bear got need 20
wallet
get cly
bear prevent forest fire
come help brother
sp
change um yeah energetically cost
lot even wanted
pack extra weight try
make period like
term resource deprivation
period there much water
available frozen drought
um there lot food
available reason
period resource debation
mammal decided uh time
instead increasing supply
decrease demand demand
metabolism theyre
turning oh thats thats
scary scare way
think climate
changing talk matter
deprivation know lack
resource know might find
time maybe bear wont
hibernate water wont
frozen weve encroached upon
land theyre like hey
guy guy supplying u food
like ever ever see
video tearing open car get
get picnic basket know
little scary
describe hibernation way
reason yeah well bear strong
atom go without saying
um yeah climate change actually
thats big push field right
try understand climate
change going hibernators
particularly cold climate
hibernators
seeing warm climate
hibernators idea
might look like
different going big
change lot lot
specie
positive benefit hibernation
otherwise animal would evolved
mammal dont
benefit mean ap
getting good
nap would dream could
um yeah benefit far
tell animal use
resilient period
suddenly isnt availability
resource gotcha really great
example actually
northern hemisphere cold
southern hemisphere
australia wildfire big
wildfire there animal
period wildfire
there suddenly food
theyll go torper
animal resilient
dont need food
survive little bit longer
kind stretch resource
currently body
cold blooded animal barely eat anyway
right mean always show alligator
voracious eater
yeah mean eat lot
maintain body temperature apart
air temperature surrounding u
air temperature
energy run
brain want
walk around little bit exactly yeah
youre exactly right cold
blooded animal dont eat lot um
go white long period
alligator think go month
almost year without eating yeah oh
god ive got funny anecdote
old advisor there
nothing funny hungry alligator
say
um youre around
least yeah thats right yeah
dont eat long period
time dont defend
body temperature defending body
temperature stable uh amount
cost lot energy
expending energy time
keep body temperature 986
youre saying thats thats
dont ill call
problem thats
necessary youre saving lot
energy barely eat run
barely doat yeah
fact worse
better burn energy
thermally maintaining body
temperature also burn energy
kinetically right like moving
gravity moving
okay
consider long would take
body burn calorie cupcake
existing easily burn
calorie cupcake
watching television okay
right say
treadmill burn calorie
cupcake like im
right yeah thats thats damn near
hour running yeah exactly exactly
thermal energy huge consumer
energy relative kinetic energy
ryan get back answer
theyre wildfire take
resource wait
tree grow back bush grow back
seems would require much
longer time typical hibernating
bear resource return
recover wildfire yeah
well would would describe
strategy stretch long
maintain area okay
stay stay active youve got day
right stay torpid youve got
month stay torp mean
there animal
northern hemisphere there
animal stay torped 9
month year oh
quite primary
growth secondary growth
say primary growth sorry
first shrubbery start
get thing eat like insect
berry theyre theyre coming
month um could
stretch get get
would say yeah okay nasa
want bio
company started faa
bio yeah faa bio company
started started three really
intelligent lady um katie uh linda
ashley ive never heard anyone say
company started three stupid
people okay thats good point
thats good point like give
credit due theyre
theyre really incredible incredible uh
human being company based
premise lot lot drug
development could benefited
looking animal extreme
physiology rather looking
animal good defending
disease human
afflicted naturally one
model use quite regularly
hibernating specie called 13
line ground squirrel specie
fantastic thing like diabetes
um esia reperfusion example
traumatic injury loss blood
flow loss oxygen return
get tissue damage wait saying
squirrel resistant diabetes
beginning hibernation
period start
hibernation season increase
body mass 100 aost
tissue let say weigh 100 gram
theyll go 250 gram theyve added
150 gram fat become
completely insulin resistant
period time end
hibernation season come around
reverse insulin resistance
theyre back noral wow
naturally reversible model diabetes
essentially thats insane yes yes
mean isnt everybody studying mean
diabetes huge huge problem
country huge know
mammal branch tree life
common
either u
branch tree life
cant genetically
steal dna secret animal
apply u
however need nasa
trying get future
astronaut yes yes
fawn trying using
extreme organism hibernators
arent specie
extraordinary there spiny mouse
example regetta capability
spiny mouse
yes spiny spiny mouse
regen regenerative
capability know per grow tail
leg right uh dont know
whole limb certainly tissue
replacement um neural tissue
replacement skin like normal tissue
replacement skin
chance mamal hibernates
length time losing muscle density
another remarkable uh aspect
hibernating specie
studied dat dont
incredible
nasa interested
get nasa yeah
break arm break arm
youre like go cast
however many month
take arm different
size youve lost muscle mass thats
thats disuse atrophy im old
enough remember old day
encouraged use limb
walking cast
exercise would say
friend broke broke limb
took cast like
limb two different people
body yeah yeah hibernators
dont incredible wow yeah
always see nature show
animal come
hibernation sir whats name
forget he like
feverish search food begin like
immediately dare forget david aten
name thats name sir david
attenburrow yes exactlys brit
allowed forget well he beloved
everywhere he even like whole
world owns guy thats
couldnt remember name
everybody know youre saying
weight loss muscle density
correct put fat
body eats fat yep
oh body eats muscle
muscle first yeah body eat muscle
first ryan dont fix u actually
faa signed really
awesome partnership eli lily trying
fix yes
actively looking actually
looking new obesity target try
see cha
say metabolism say yet want
consume adapost dont want
consume protein dont want consume
carbohydrate want
metabolism eat exactly yeah
thats want yeah ryan
research came across nugget
information worrying
amazing breath
find hibernating animal
level protection radiation yeah
started early 50 think 51
first study looked
irradiating hibernators
basically gave huge dos gamma
radiation learned
hyting specie survived
radiation far better rat
example particularly incre
protection radiation
increased corper
specie uniquely protected
radiation study started
early 50 still great
idea fat
absorbs gamas think
reactive oxygen specie
please explain yeah
reactive oxygen specie well guess
im chemist couldnt tell
exactly reactive oxygen specie
product metabolism
reactive oxygen
specie term suggests
react cause sort
bad stuff happen tissue
damage tissue damage essentially
radiation come hit
hydrogen like proton come
get hydrogen uh interacts
oxygen creates reactive oxygen
specie damage body
youve ever store
everybody phrase right
antioxidant youve seen
store food thats thats theyre
designed counteract reactive oxygen
specie sort im anti anything
way thats fair um thats
think lot protection
coming animal
really good natural antioxidant
uh torpid
state also
reduction metabolism get
reduction mitochondrial function
get less oxygen uh tissue
well less water there less
thing radiation interact
create reactive oxygen
specie less thing mean
there less active biology disrupt
way say yeah
animal come hibernation
uh radiated gamma ray
going like bear smash
bear doesnt become
want anyone fire gamas
bloody bear want going green
hulk dont yeah dont chance
small big
enough squirrel go
theyre hibernating
fill layer nut stay
winner eat
deal actually hibernating
one everybodys seen
life tre squirrel big bushy
tale um dont hibernate youre
right c theyre food caching
animal instead instead turning
demand store away supply
essentially winter cant sneak
winter get
unfortunately go
go theory squirrel
different poking bear yeah
thats true there
understanding biologically
hibernating mammal would
radiative resistance clear
would evolutionarily
right thats really great point
there really seems
reason evolutionarily would act
shouldnt say actively
trait might selected
probably passive consequence
thing theyve defending
uh physiology
hibernation torper say
sort deadly becoming protected
radiation describe
wow right
go youre trying help nasa
mar mar mission
nine month nine month back
two year planet
specific mission theyre tasking
think right
phase conceptual phase nyak there
three phase conceptual phase two
make concept come life
phase three sort flight
mission uh conceptual
design nasa uh turned attention
towards trying figure hazard
space mar mission
planned coming dont really
good answer thing like radiation
disuse atrophy lengthy stay space
essentially started drive
different way mitigate
one way theyve
really interested hibernation
unit designing
nyak right actually
ability first time
history study hibernation space
dont even know
hibernation work space nobody
even thought send hibernating
animal say happen
primate hibernate
im thinking theoretically
might possible
human even culture u
tree life right rather trying
think rework bear
squirrel whatever might
mouse one primate
son make two primate
least um
oh okay
fat sailed lemur madagascar
use torper quite quite well
actually um related
specie u use
hibernation ski season
madagascar mean would
drought drought big one
madagascar drought drought
dry period chance
share part
code u human
think actually pretty good chance um
think look
evolutionarily seems hibernation
pretty basil condition pretty
mean basil pretty
far tree life deep
started cop wouldnt
gan splice would
gene enable unlock thats
thinking unlock gene interesting
know physiologically
cuz know without water
die quickly uh
happening
physiologically storing water
cell retain
mean whats going know yeah
idea yeah
machine back
yeah one ever deep bear
cave deny story yeah
thats true well actually might
know somebody um used
know someone yeah used thats
good point
mean specifically
madagascar fat tail theyre
primate like said die
quickly without water whats
going yeah
unfortunately dont know um okay
theyre theyre incredibly endangered
specie invasive study
dont happen
whole whole animal
physiology survival physiology
cant really tell lally whats going
water ler
infer hibernating specie
know theyre really good
recycling water
there change ral function
essentially allows recycle
little bit better mean dont eat
dont pee whole time dont
eat dont drink dont pee
dont poop complete shutdown
metabolism wow everything come
bodily system brain system
controlling cant
thats somethings got
still going control yeah
there tissue still active
neural tissue
still active generally speaking
cortex quite quiescent
there lot going cortex
neural tissue see going
coming either brain well
brain stem hypothalamus
brain stem controlling heart
rate uh respiratory rate thing like
keeping blood moving even
though moving slowly
lung functioning um obviously
there muscle stay
active like diaphragm
upper respiratory muscle stay
active um hypothalamus dont know
youve read tissue
basically one main
tissue controlling metabolism body
temperature regulating
really tightly metabolism
body temperature
hypothalamus
tissue reading active well
thats actually really
interesting tissue
functioning mammal 4°
cels something human
couldnt right couldnt bring
human 4° c ask
tissue continue work youd get
complete neuronal failure theyve
theyve developed evolved way
maintain tissue function despite
really cold man sound like
scifi cool like thats
amazing yeah get
quantitative basil metabolism
keeping body temperature
24 hour run 2200
2400 calorie man size
well yeah nah yeah come man
saying big
living 2000 calorie get
didnt say 2000 said 2400 20 222 around
okay right say
mean make
comfortable let live li
iss watching tv he watching
okay im one hybrid
native state calorie need
drop youre hybrid native
state depends
round number call 2000
depends depth
hibernation achieve youre
total depth total deepest deepest
depth would tenth
calorie nine per day
yes per day 2000 less
one calorie per day deepest
hibernators weve seen theyll
theyll reduce metabolism 99
little bit 99 wow dam thats
insane okay thats still wait
want
bad want badly
metabolism thats going
po clear 99 drop
2000 calorie 20 calorie oh okay
yeah youre right im bad math
suppose okay um fraction
say 99 would
nearing single digit
calorie would expect
crazy yeah okay chuck
point induce state tor
cant say right lie
dont think
calorie thing got happen put
mind yeah
forget meditation tape youre
halfway long
expect human able go
state torper know
talk squirrel 9 month
viable human well answer
first question get
naturally there lot circadian
rhythm thats associated
light cycle kind tell
animal obviously
there there facultative side
basically mean soon
food taken away tell
go hybernation pet
hamster youve ever heard story
people walking thought dead
hamster thats facultative hibernator
trigger food
gone away must hibernate
theyll go torper there
different way
actually getting really good
last 10 year getting really
good taking animal shouldnt
hibernation putting
hibernation rat example
prime example go
change thing
hypothalamus make drop
metabolism drop body temperature
look like theyre torper
take food away human get
hangry yeah hangry yeah yeah
youve got youre gonna
possibly chemically induce
yeah there probably chemical
induction
invol process yeah talk
circadian rhythm human
being pretty
particular know put somebody
sleep couple month there
going huge adjustment period
come mean
want talk disoriented
like theyre space top
lot stuff throw
seems like lot man people get really
hangry less thats true
learned though circadian
clock hybrid actually
continues function torper
slowly metabolism slower
amount time
elapsed circadian clock despite
month versus day
example might help
disorientation bring back earth
temporarily bear come
torpa reboot
reboot doesnt quite work 100 yeah yeah
organ go back 100
youre space
human going come reboot
doesnt
quite something
movie dont get right oh
thing movie dont get right
yeah okay yeah thing everything
um know thing cant
freeze people thats thats thats gone
window year ago
incredibly taxing come
hibernation actually
physiologically demanding part
hibernation would argue
everything come online
correct
heart cant bump fast
peripheral tissue ready uh
cant cant inflate lung
much still cold
could could break alvu alike
there there
incredibly coordinated event
animal coming hibernation
process actually quite slow uh
rodent could take long
hour two come human
bear little bit less
body temperature started little
higher metabolic rate little high
dont go deep hibernation
still take time
dangerous beginning austin
power brought
deep freeze yeah thought
um peed like three
minute point comedic
effect im saying pee like
lot wake morning
obviously extension
im still wondering pee
youre going pee
hibernate youre going
big as pee wake
think well maybe know
know experience there lot
urine uh hibernation period
hibernated ive seen
animal
chucky slipped
thats really going effect
kidney kidney function
yeah renal function quite quite uh
dramatically changed hibernation
yeah bladder arent full uh
end period dont
urinate lot
recycling water also
reduction metabolism youre
using much water well
yeah know sleep youre still
quite metabolically active sleep
animal doesnt naturally
hibernate say human coming
hibernation
torper programmed naturally
get right could go
cataclysmically wrong certainly could
yeah oh right
closest thing toror
human going coma would
benefit sustaining u
way sustain people
put like medically induced coma
like yeah thats great thought
actually would argue closest
state hibernation human
achieve actually sleep
thinking hibernation
extension sleep
squash medium uh mistake
hibernation isnt sleep actually
dont sleep hibernation fact
seems come hibernation
sleep theyre sleeping
theyre torper everything
physiologically speaking sleep
similar hibernation except
far deeper hibernation
youre exactly right think think
human hibernation going look
like sort uh assisted state
natural right
there lot lot
hurdle well overcome
get induce
cybernation person
come think
meantime
sort assisted state
maintaining fluid nutrient balance
right level um know whole
host thing really close
real thats great question uh dont
know know certainly 5
year sort thing get
human hibernation um know
maybe looking closer 10 15
year would say realistically
first volunteer would happily
actually there lab there lab
massa funding well trying
extend depth metabolic
depression human reduction
human say sleep using
using chemical thats closest
think right getting human
metabolically lowered
state already starting cross
starting line would say
getting
closer metabolically lowered state
jump start gene therapy
jump start entrance like
torpid state mean yeah give
upgrade area
im team um
know really necessary
thing right place go
right
direction think going need
um dont know yet
exactly put jumper
cable right wheres right spot
making change
go torpid state reliably
know hypothalamus going
important endeavor know
change going key
dont know exactly
hypothalamus yet okay there lot
problem come
depressing metabolism lowering body
temperature thing like there
lot problem well solve
time
talked cast atrophy
muscle atrophy even sit
around know fact
exercising
body kind made
combat muscle atrophy associated
asleep couple month
yeah yeah thats thats one
big problem going
face thats
studying hibernators natural hibernators
think going key figuring
question dont know really
know balance
protein degradation protein
synthesis thats really
muscle tissue balance come
either increase uh synthesis
maintain tissue decrease
degradation see
hibernators actually little
bit boat torper theyll theyll
decrease degradation pathway
theyll increase synthesis
pathway actually making little bit
new muscle hibernation
season figure
theyre
maintain sort
higher level answer
dont know wouldnt
able use one like
electronic uh muscle stimulators
see advertised back
magazine like know put
youll sixpack ab three week
yeah force muscle contraction um thats
probably way would go think
there think there
sophisticated way thats
less like example
astronaut without
electron stimulation
basically weight train resistance
train resistance yeah lot time
theyre space
sort combat micro
gravity thats saying thats giving
muscle cue stay full tissue
theyll start degrade right
question neil
made think im im sorry
im directing attention away
said space weight train
weight dont weight
know mean like
weight
spring ah okay like rubber band
okay okay right let le
positive future ryan say able
induce state torper
spacecraft going planetary
logistics need
nice cozy bed going
slopping around amnot
fluid need need
oxygen need consideration
co2
expelling hydration
thing logistics
need coming term yeah
well need temperpedic mattress okay
ryan im letting know retrofit
pod tempic mattress yeah
yeah ive liked watching movie
sense there lot creativity
sort make pod
look like youre weightless wont
need mattress point yeah
advertise used yes sp
need eight
minute youre going right
rest time youre weightless
doesnt matter there mattress
thats true
depression takeoff
thats thats yeah
sleep space space space
space little sleeping
bag slide keep warm
yeah okay interrupt keep
floating around thats totally fine
yeah especially keep around
somebody elses well
token think think someone
torpid like state space going
need sort sequestering
environment like pod kind like
would see movie
would would say yeah co2 probably
main concern come
hibernation lowered
metabolic rate o2 becomes less
concern obviously still need
dont need much co2
still eventually build youre
going sequester co2 away
recycle o2 think human
going need sort
supportive fluid real
question hibernation
going look like natural
hibernation dont go
torper stay torper actually
go torper periodically
spontaneously come torper
24 hour nobody idea
go back
repeat cycle throughout
entire hibernation season like u
waking middle night
exactly whats timeline
cycle depending specie
robust hibernators
like 13 line ground squirrel theyll
stay torper period
20ish day
theyll arouse spontaneously go
call interbout arousal
theyll stay 12
24 hour theyll go back
torper 20 day
come hibernation thats
actually sleep
hibernation season still
seems still must sleep like
mammal sleeping
always heard neurological
necessity youre saying
whatevers going hibernation
serve body need get
sleeping precisely interesting
still come sleep
maybe
cycle toror human might
little different toror
4 day come
three day instead
month know figure
formula might different yeah
formula think formula
certainly different actually
bear prime examp example
formula different bear dont
inb rosel sleep
associated toror like state
thats think
continuum sleep deep torper
bear sort closer
sleep side um dont need
inb rles must sleeping
fashion torper
hibernation season suspect
human fall side theyll
look like bear participate
fat bear photo contest dont
im hearing
think might
yeah every fall think people
put get know whoevers
wilderness get fattest bear
photo possibly yeah there
fat as bear oh get really
big yeah get oh god anost
tissue theyre putting
fat tissue thats
fat ryan point
youre going want test little
well say little furry creature set
space tell last saw
chest hair would count furry
creature yeah um yes however youre
suggesting send big old bear
space mean reality would
informative thing put
space would bear
think thats human hibernation
going look like dont think
thats ever going happen near
future imagine wake grumpy
yeah imagine dry
know reality check
difference bear
cave bear space bear
space weightless unless
spacecraft spin creates
artificial gravity creates
artificial gravity difference
bear space bear
cave zero difference
like there salmon
swimming right
actually testing zero g
effect yeah well well z g
radiation two thing
youre really getting earth
getting space
outside low earth orbit obviously
yeah yeah radiation
clear youre low earth
orbit youre still shielded earth
magne field lot high energy ray
w youre go anywhere
low earth orbit radiation
dose matter
course youre radiatively
resistant hibernation state
work
maybe radiatively resistant
hibernating animal came
space line thinking
make sense yeah alien brought
one didnt survive
radiative died one
came earth
thats next uh pixar
movie space animal id watch
id watch see ryan
got got call quits
highly illuminating
conversation im delighted learn
got top people working uh
ive always jealous
animal people say oh human body
perfection there
plenty animal
feature would delight yes
dont among regenerating
limb yeah hibernation sound like fun
want chill couple
month
im glad know got good people
three
leader tackling kind
biomedical challenge applying
nasa great learn
thank much
really great time talking
hope hopefully
fun conversation everybody yeah
absolutely man g always good
man thank neil always pleasure
friend right chucky baby know
neil degrass tyson closing yet
another edition star talk special
edition one hibernating space
always bid keep looking
music
