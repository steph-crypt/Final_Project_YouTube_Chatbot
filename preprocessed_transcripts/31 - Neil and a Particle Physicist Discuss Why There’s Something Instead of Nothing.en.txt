music
dark energy though thats
particle well dont well dont
know harry har harry im going throw
one harry particle
physicist try talk dark energy
thing go really badly wrong actual
truth particle arent really
fundamental ingredient
universe particle actually
like little vibration field
theyre like ripple ocean
like maybe dark energy kind
quantum fluctuation thats left
run number get
answer 10 power 120 time
big big universe
would ripped apart instant
suggests must stuff
havent found
yet star talk neil degrass tyson
youre personal astrophysicist
chuck nice hey man whats
happening say youre
personal comedian uh okay
involve personal
basis okay okay take back take
back uh today going cosmic
query yes yeah
learned stuff yeah yeah
good stuff good stuff
right going particle
physic
wow didnt know going
good know know little bit
particle physic im expert
okay anytime hit kind
impass got bring expert right
wheres sort best particle
physic world happening uh
collider yeah
collider thats start okay yeah yeah
itll collider going
happen uh weve got someone who worked
cern right geneva right he
particle physicist university
cambridge uk oh dear help
welcome harry cliff harry welcome
start talk harry great talk
thanks yeah worked
large hadron collider
one experiment cern
role
well still work actually
lhc massive 19 mile ring buried
underground actually four
experiment ring four
place smash particle together
work one
called lhcb b stand beauty
type particle
interested studying still
work analyze data look
place current theory might
break although havent found
yet bit frustrating
although getting hint
thats thats general job
going load load data
trying find place seeing
new effect weve seen wa
beauty thats one name one
quark yeah yeah
six quark make
well two make nucleus
atom four others
weird name first
two found original
two called strange charm
last two
disagreement call
people wanted call truth
beauty really lovely
poetic end physicist
call top bottom
know little bit boring
work particle study b
quark rather known beauty
physicist bottom physicist
u least beauty got
got vote okay yeah beauty yeah
truth beauty gotta say though
uh think uh know top
bottom might uh bit
interesting respect
laughter
family show okay right
harry left uh
quirk completing family
six quirk get
yeah thats right strange
charmed yep truth beauty top
bottom thats top bottom exactly
thats right thats right six far
know maybe there weve
found six okay youre quark
man got love quark people
delighted cuz reach
public often youve written two
popular level book love im
looking title first one
make apple pie scratch
search recipe
universe oh wow well thats evokes
something carl sean said
1980 uh cosmos okay said
make apple pie say start
big bang inspire
title yeah absolutely yeah
scene think episode five
he sitting he actually sitting
cambridge trinity college
apple pie brought
look camera little
twinkle eye say wish
make apple pie scratch
must first invent universe
kind go talk
atom apple pie made
inside star kind like
quite wellknown phrase physic
came like university
education kind thought
neat way talking know
universe made
lens trying find
make apple pie really
complicated recipe let get
basic yeah going say im
going honest though
long walk around block get
apple pie start univers good good
thing take know
cool work 138 billion year im
especially delighted recently
published book love title space
oddity thats david bowie
space od space oddity fact
first hit know david
bowie first hit space aity oh okay
yeah ground control
thats put map
thats thats title subtitle
mysterious anomaly challenging
understanding universe oo ooh
interesting based
solicited question audience
patreon supporter well get
minute want first
extract physic tell u
inventory fundamental
particle yet
ill job
really hope there know
17 particle total
moment six quark
weve already talked two
make nucleus atom
there electron go around
atom electron also come
triplet three electron
likee particle next one called
muon something called
towel thats another three get
nine three
neutrino like ghostly particle
zip universe
u dont really notice
time give 12
call matter particle total
neutrino related three
specie electron right
exactly think family
yeah exactly electron
partner called electron neutrino
muon version neutrino
towel yeah got
12 particle mean
mystery come
like three copy call
generation dont know
mysterious kind like
lego brick set
dont understand
particular piece
force three force
kind quantum description world
dont include gravity dont know
deal yet weve got
electromagnetic force weak force
strong force
particle photon particle
light go electromagnetism
something called gluon
particle strong force stick
quark together w
zed boson particle
weak force weird force
related radioactive process
thing 16 total
last one found decade
ago lhc higs boson
kind finish 17
particle call standard
model dont think thats end
story lot reason mostly
astronomy actually thanks
know colleague
discovering inconvenient stuff
universe called dark matter
suggests must
stuff havent found yet
interesting yeah whatever dark matter
idea maybe guy
find particle
accelerator right wed
happy right
term equation right
like know something
somethings somethings
throw equation right
let somebody else figure
hell something
dark energy though
thats particle well dont well
dont know harry harry harry harry
im going throw one
harry mean yeah idea
right absolutely idea think
fair say mean
particle physicist try talk
dark energy thing go really badly wrong
careful
original well idea one idea
dark energy call
vacuum energy energy left
empty space youve taken
away everything else atom
particle particle
physic actual truth
particle arent really fundamental
ingredient universe
actually made something
fundamental called quantum
field 17 particle
talked
corresponding field particle
actually like little vibration
field theyre like ripple
ocean like field even
youve got rid particle
theyre still vacuum
take idea maybe dark
energy kind quantum
fluctuation thats left
field vacuum run
number find get answer
10 power 120 time big
thats 10 120 zero end
like ludicrously enormous
number big universe
would ripped apart instant
idea whats going really
particle physic point view
biggest discrepancy
ever theory observation
however couldnt also something
else since dont know
couldnt something else thats
tamping tamping field
isnt ripping youre
making stuff mean mean thats
thats feasible
field mean youre dead right like
theorist go
okay numers crazy let add
another thing cancel thats
exactly people try
know could theoretical particle
physicist perhaps semantics
16 particle uh plus
higs bon minus three force
carrier take u 13
think count
antimatter version particle
separate particle yeah mean
could could multiply number
many time like quark
example version electric charge
strong force called color
whereas electric charge there
one type electric charge
strong force three theyre
called red green blue get red
quark green quark blue quark
bizarrely mean actually
arent six quark 18
add anti quark give 36
go like crazy number
take thing
account basically
antiparticle exist
field like electron
field electron antielectron
different sort vibration
field field tend
count like one thing
two start
get mad okay
interesting clarify talking
lifespan particle uh
show offline
offline mentioned
measured particle dont
phd thesis phd thesis measured
particle last
lifespan one trillionth second
said relatively
long yeah mean
couple privileged particle
live forever there electron
think life forever proton
life forever everything else
decay eventually even like neutron
neutron floating
space decay 15 minute
get heavier heavier
particle tend decay interesting yeah
15 minute thats break
neutron set free 15 minute later
go go well turn
proton tell
decay product turn
proton electron anti
nutrino get three thing ah
gotcha okay here something cool
want show little bit
particle physic know okay hear
said neutron becomes
proton electron antio okay
watch kind particle neutron
end something
isnt kind particle youre
done okay conservation
law okay neutron become
proton wait minute proton
plus one charge right
got got got cancel
cancel cancel
um wait proton oh
oh wait wait proton proton
plus one plus one who got minus one
thats electron electron boom said
cancel good however
electron thats kind
particle didnt start
got undo fact
electron oh cuz got need
conservation got conserv
get rid fact
electron electron
paired neut neutrino
say get
electron get anti neutrino anti
neutrino canceling electron
thats great way balance
question thing
thing actually
saying okay need cancel
well take u yeah
hypothesis require
universe observation
universe requires u oh
good good one liked
liked lot well mean guess
go back 1896 hre beckel french
uh physicist famously discovered
radioactivity lab left
uranium salt top piece
photog graic paper saw even
like bit card
salt paper
photographic film got exposed
seeing
prot neutron decaying proton
basically radiation
emitted uranium salt
kind knew process
called betto decay back
day ernest rutherford
others studied late 19th
century kind knew
process way even knew
neutron took another four 40
year phenomenon appeared
first took lot longer actually
figure going beta
particle electron correct yeah
exactly thats right yeah
time didnt know neutron
neutron would come didnt know
neutron 1930
clumsy language account
okay yeah youre saying
universe requiring u right
recognize property
become rather helpful correct
calculation prediction
make yeah mean whole whole
subject particle physic kind
built idea mathematical
symmetry symmetry
either respected broken
generates powerful
mathematical description universe
mean like way looking
world extraordinarily
successful like give like
example amazing theory one
there one quantity
example quantity use
calculate magnetism
electron electron
well electric charge
behaves like little magnet limit
magnetic field calculate
strong little magnet
one part think 10 billion
experiment really
really precise experiment get
number 10 decimal place
crazy kind way
looking word incredibly
powerful um time know
massively missing something
dont know dark matter
dark energy
stuff amazingly successful
theory also
incomplete yeah know
enough universe quantify
ignorance yeah im going say
yeah without anything get 10 10
place pretty much nailed
yeah nailed nailed
digital world filled endless tool

description back show let
go question way
patreon supporter
patron star talk yes uh
occasionally solicited question
might specifically tuned
guest youre studio
u youre coming u london
doesnt matter questioner
dont care right
go got check say hi star
talk team andrew cork city
ireland dr cliff please explain
research cp violation
bmon uh contributes understanding
matter antimatter asymmetry
universe thanks million like
let let te okay
astronomy part
go
particle physic part right
look early universe
matter there energy
matter energy know equivalent
right bath
energy spontaneously make particle
law symmetry
universe say particle
matter antimatter pair came
nothing got come back
together okay got
going okay
point universe
soup energy created one extra
particle every hundred million
particle made
dance pair go away
thats annihilation annihilation anation
annihilation one person left
got nobody annihilate
everything know love
universe call matter wait
matter yes one wait yeah yes
matter yes yes everything else
photon everything else turned
energy left one
100 million playing playing
musical chair musical chair
everybody pair theyre happy
right think everybodys
paired one person left
there one pair ever
make everything
matter love know
universe harry
mean wish could claim
responsibility existence
universe well mean yeah big
problem say like see
experiment bang
particle together large hadron
collider always see equal number
particle antiparticle made
happens question
get asymmetry
russian physicist back
70 think called andre sakarov
came three condition
satisf ified allow matter
win battle antimatter
early universe first one pretty
obviously need process
make particle antiparticle
thats number one second one though
condition known cp violation
ch cp stand charge parity
sort symmetry relates
matter antimatter kind like
mirror put matter cp
mirror uh show antimatter
looking process
violate symmetry bz
questioner asked
particle contain beauty
quark another quark like paired
antiquark usually
particular type particle
really weird dance
create one b meson
travel experiment
oscillates backwards forward
matter antimatter
flip identity nice
sort periodic way
watch often often
decay matter state
often decay
antimatter state measure
difference see difference
tell law
universe violate cp symmetry
symmetry matter
antimatter kind key
ingredient one key ingredient
need explain mystery
universe power violate
law process yeah exactly
first discovered uh dont
know back 80 originally
studying lot different
particle know cp
symmetry broken good thing
wasnt wouldnt
mystery current
particle know dont break
enough symmetry
slightly broken need
way symmetry breaking
explain fact exist
universe look didnt
know mechanism
break symmetry
im cockal warmed
knowledge well okay next question
fascinating stuff okay uh sa
sain sakar friend matter
antimatter asymmetry cause
big bang talked
could mean going make
big bang man yeah yeah
hiding
u yeah astrophysically happens
much later okay formation
universe large hron
collider probing condition
would prevailed big
bang close
beginning think im
wording question
matter antimatter asymmetry would
mattered otherwise mattered
astrophysically universe mean
dont really know
process broke symmetry happened
could h lhc say
kind recreating condition
big bang probing
condition existed
trillionth second time zero
ever thing thats
kind
possibility moment
actually related higs
boson thing happened
trillionth second
universe existence called called
electro week symmetry breaking
basically higs field
give mass particle
made switched first time
reset law well reset
basic ingredient universe
set form force
sort transition bit like um
water boiling like kind like
change state change state
vacuum may
moment created
antimatter thats
one reason built
lhc recreate condition
see see process happening
phase transition said water
boiling going regular water
boiling even freezing right water
going water completely changing
state use vocabulary
sort loosely early universe
maybe literally universe changing
state existence
saying going happen anywhere
thats going happen
thats there
serious action going pipe
yeah mean well theoretically
sort figure
event looked like
certain condition find
equation standard model
make particle anti
particle certain phase
transition happen
particular way actually need
particle exist
standard model standard model
cant standard
model plus thing
also possible happened
earlier talking like know
trillionth second
big bang trillionth
trillionth trillionth second
youre getting closer time zero
help become accepting
fact blame
trans blame weird
oddity going
transitional moment universe
right thats stuff
going
right okay excellent time
couple else got
right know im going go magnus
say
magnus magnus son fallen
father husband murdered wife
magnus shall revenge
okay im sorry um come
yeah dont
know sound like
say name magn name magnus
clearly plight magnus
okay right say respect dr
cliff um may describe link
see quantum field
theory gold standard
standard model perfect
description current knowledge b
var
version quantum gravity mhm uh ie
string theory loop quantum gravity
depend uh ad cft duality
without background dependency
add im swede
switzerland confusing
right okay
confusing american okay magnus
question dont
dont get question um wait go
ahead harry follow
question follow question
think think asking
well relationship
quantum field theory
language standard model
language particle physic string
theory loop quantum gravity mean
think question mean
would say really
underqualified talk quantum
gravity area think
would say quantum gravity
theory say little
particle physic moment
know string theory loop quantum gravity
whatever favorite flavor quantum
gravity theory bearing
experiment high
energy particle physic lhc
one big problem
theory dont really make
testable prediction far would
love string theorist someone
else could come along say know
string theory right
experiment collider youll
see far hasnt happened
really quantum field theory
kind gold standard
theory work maybe itll
replaced one theory later
think waya aways
interesting right say
dont care
gravity id love include gravity id
love hard problem
currently best understanding
thing going
universe sort quant
quantum field theory give
u best understanding everything
maybe well modify
something else ready take
waiting wing
umbrella yeah mean
know like modern physic
two pillar describe
pretty much everything physic
quantum field theory one hand
describes particle quantum
mechanic know stuff
gravity
hand general relativity
classical theory nonquantum
theory two
separate theory actually
dont really overlap
mean place would
see quantum gravitational effect
center black hole
earliest moment big bang
really extreme condition everything
else two separate theory work
perfectly well thats kind
problem actually place
get evidence quantum gravity
really extreme condition
way way away able
recreate laboratory thats
make difficult cool man
okay right give another right
here another one uh uh fredick
johansson say hello fredrich
northern sweden
uh fredick come hood right
hello fredick
detroit say friedrich uh
northern sweden uh
fundamental particle type
exactly mass
know oh id love really
cool question id love yeah
particle specie identical
every way limit
measurement mean well
measure right yeah every
electron exactly every
electron every proton exactly
every proton
reason well proton bad example
actually say electron electron
actually made thing called
electron field invisible
fluid like thing throughout
universe every electron little
ripple field
result hit hit electron
field make electron make
type thing everywhere thats
theyre identical mean could
almost always argue every
electron thing part
object every particle
certain specie absolutely
identical indistinguishable
thats really fundamental actually
understanding particle physic
quantum theory isnt isnt borg
like yeah borg
member borg theyre indidual
conscious wise theyre theyre
one one entity although electron dont
come along try turn
electron right good start trek
geek locutus
electron resistance futile part
question know
havent measured every
electron universe youre
saying know enough field
know there one kind
particle make case
therefore youre going get
electron every single time
really cool yeah yeah yeah oh man
okay hey star talk fan dont know
know audio version
podcast actually post week
advance video version
get spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk
yazan al haari say cheer
new jersey okay right im
artist filmmaker studying relativity
im fascinated einstein theory
applied large hadron collider
particle approach speed
light dr cliff could explain
relativity shape understanding
high energy collision whether
might someday possible safely
create small black hole somewhere
collider neil
possible would uh would like
throw something black hole
totally oh yeah okay
make like like amusement park
game know hit black hole
disappears singularity
question reminds earlier
conversation harry
studied particle decayed
trillionth second seems
trillionth second
certain speed
faster particle go longer
would take decay time
frame shifted relative
observer cant declare
trth second without specifying
speed particle
rest trillionth second
particle point view
frame particle
particle rest basically
particle youd live trillion
second point view
lab say thing
going close speed light
live way longer actually
travel live long enough
relativistic time
dilation fly centimeter
experiment live
trillion per second wouldnt go
anywhere near far youre
absolutely right mean like relativity
special relativity say
know fundamental collider
basically e
equal mc squ machine take e
energy kinetic energy
accelerated particle bang
together make make new
particle new matter effectively like
absolutely fundamental
question black
hole thats really general relativity
idea back
lhc switched extra
dimension space extra direction
could move would
possible create microscopic black
hole lhc led load
tabloid story lhc going
create black hole going
swallow geneva swallow rest
planet going
disappear caused like
big storm pr british tabloid
press actually really got hold
story cern create health
safety report exciting
risk assessment youll ever read
basically describes various
hazard one like black
hole swallow earth
creation bubble universe
expands destroy entire
reality risk assessment
destruction universe
one possible come
basically said
unlikely happen fine
um unlikely still got money
gave still let
well one going sue
destroy planet
right he already thought tell
there youtube video large
hazra coller turned there
countdown there youtube video
parking lot outside cern
clock counting
get zero
parking lot fall
wow whole
pretty funny terrifying yeah going
say funny youre astro
physicist rest u
funny say
reason knew wasnt going
happen thats universe
experiment
billion year proton
hit upper atmosphere much
higher energy lhc
possible every object
universe would turned
black hole kind knew
reason wasnt going happen
right right there greater particle
accelerator universe universe
oo look right
right viper say hello dr
tyson dr cliff lord nice sam
oalen missour uh 16
wondering ton year
would like would would like
know guy
go depth explaining
deal tachon oh wow okay yeah
mean well really know
tachon theyre hypothetical particle
travel faster light
dont think theyre allowed exist
would violate causality
idea like one event lead
another way around
think thing
kind cook equation
theyre basically forbidden
turn star trek think like
know science fiction way like
facilitating time travel
time dont think thing
exist reality maybe neil
may know well
let see merlin say
dear
merlin tachon rick mcfarling
dallas texas tachon hypothetical
particle travel faster
speed light named greek takis
meaning swift also get word
tachometer einstein equation
special relativity bestow particle
array bizarre property
top five one slowest attach
move slightly greater
speed light two tachon
infinite velocity three tachon
loses energy speed gain
energy slows tachon appears
travel backwards time
observer send friend
message tachon receive
message sent
ton yet detected
go there thatd useful
email forget
reply right sit inbox
week could send
back time would amazing
yeah favorite tachon account
would see someone walking
corridor slip lip
banana peel he friend
dont want harmed right
go tach texting app
okay already
happened send text say
watch banana peel
get text step
banana peel right okay
person walking corridor
get text look
text say watch
slip
theyre text
text right chuck got
time one maybe two question
actually let go uh jonas drand
jonas say uh good morning dr cliff
dr tyson uh astrol lord nice okay
okay uh jonas appalachian
foothill north carolina uh
dark matter living room
oh state seriously dark
matter scattered throughout universe
clump around distant
galaxy cluster present
earth allow one search
setting collider sir
oh love well thank jonas
great question live
hill appal got lot
time hand right yeah he
taking hike thinking dark
matter know yeah got
mean definitely
would dark matter living room
yeah sure cuz well
actually really astronomy rather
particle physic idea
every galaxy like sits
big spherical cloud dark matter
galaxy kind middle
cloud dark matter
particle floating around galaxy
theyre floating u
earth therell
room depends massive
many would actually
yeah doesnt
actually help u lhc
lhc trying make
energy experiment
go live big shaft
tank really cold zenon
kind noble gas wait
dark matter particle drift
earth hit zenon atom
detector create little flicker
light directly detect dark
matter bit like poltergeist
moving know throwing crockery
around living room thats kind
waiting see
detects getting
sensitive still havent seen
anything frustrating
hopefully one day theyll pick something
last question right david
smith say hello dr dr see lord
nice dave smith hailing naples
florida know found
antimatter antimatter matter
cancel violence
interaction aftermath
moment ever slight see
matter antimatter
epic confrontation made
boxing match like yeah he
king particle particle
octagon exactly two particle enter one
particle leaf case two
particle enter particle leave oh
thats real good fight thats real
good fight yeah antia particle
wilderness identify
unless see annihilate
yeah actually way
discovered originally carl
anderson american physicist back 1932
thing called cloud
chamber amazing instrument
allows see individual
subatomic particle basically
create trail water droplet
go chamber
see little trace one
chamber caltech
california seeing cosmic ray
coming space see
electron see proton
magnetic field chamber saw
one track would looked like
electron kind form
bending wrong direction
electron positive
charge one photograph
enough anderson say ive
discovered antimatter mean
atern there there really cool
experiment called alpha
actually make atom antimatter
make antihydrogen trap
magnetic bottle cant obviously
keep bottle would
annihilate bottle
really strong magnetic field
store thing keep stored
hour shine
light look spectroscopy
kind really cool stuff
actually kind effectively
store stuff small
quantity antihydrogen would
antiproton antielectron
orbit around yeah get chance
go cern visit alfha
experiment awesome
uh interest
disclosure regarding carl anderson
existence antimatter
predicted okay right fery
correct direct direct thank
framework even able
interpret result right
yeah electron
opposite opposite charge right
otherwise identical
electron mass everything
thats pretty cool yeah cool
yeah cool knew twin huh
evil twin evil twin
twin goatee thats right
electron goatee whats going
thats comic strip
antimatter comic strip need
right well listen harry thank
star talk love
love talk
youre arm reach id love
come back
particle physic question yeah id
happy great talking
really good fun presence
internet handle
people track yeah
find website harry
cliff couk want see im
im also twitter x
whatever calling harry v cliff
latest book mysterious
anomaly ch uh space oddity
mysterious anomaly challenging
understanding universe nice
arent many book
dont know thats
kind book thing
thats odd whats know
could write book could could
write whole book dont know
im telling right
know scientist love thing dont
understand thats thats science
make progress thats
book like
weird little effect could
nothing could clue
something really big sort
trying figure yeah
looking forward penguin random
house whoa year big big big time
buddy big
time right good
harry thanks joining u pleasure
chuck always good man always
pleasure there yet another
installment star talk cosmic query
particle physic edition next time
neil degrass tyson bidding
keep looking
music
