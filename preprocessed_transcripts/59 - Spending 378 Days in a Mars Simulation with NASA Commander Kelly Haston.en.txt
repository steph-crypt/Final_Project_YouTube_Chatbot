idea behind put people
simulation basically pretending
mar activity
associated guy make anything
happen yeah idea isolation
devastating psychological
drama would u think
incredibly isolating time also
opportunity get closer people
movie night
entertainment really big
movie selection watched dont
even know many
watched like seemed like every
marvel movie actually checklist
went sound like
nerdiest heist crew ever
significant level nerd cant
lie star talk neil de grass
tyson personal astrophysicist
course im chuck kn chuck
baby hey whats happening right
nice good uh youve
right know im actually ive
well yeah
great time past month
thank asking good im
im happy right got
keep comedian happy well
thats thats thats oxy right
happy
comedian thats kind job
everybody got make sure
youre ready gig right
know going talk
today mhm simulating mar oh
goodness well supposedly get
get
as know supposedly going
point
simulate
figure going
figure expertise
whatsoever okay found
commander kelly hon kelly welcome
star
talk hi nice yeah
youre youre commander
commander first three
simulated mar mission nasa right
even though didnt fly
vacuum space still got
call commander whole
mission simulated yes yes know
lucky going say
make simulat
commander yes yes im im analog
commander analog analog okay
phd biomed science thats
exactly kind know thats
want thats yeah thats mar
habitat thats markwat
didnt leave dead
mar still earth good
simulation
talking nasa chapia
mission pronounce correctly
yes yes chapia read like one
tortured acronym take
chapia uh
crew um health uh
basically going evaluate
health performance crew
oneyear mar uh mission b
idea behind put people
simulation actually test
isolation resource
restriction including food communication
water sort thing
kind resource imagine
would need amars mission
actually limit limited amount um
three four people actually
basically pretending mar
activity associated
uh keeping habitat functioning
science actually
mission know part
military call enhanced
interrogation know
test see theyll kill
right thats thats
thats great reality show
yes great reality show
leave weapon outside
think maybe chapia crew
health performance
exploration analog wow okay yeah
sound like something would put
yogurt like im healthy put much
chapa
yogurt take place
took place h hanger johnson
space center 3d printed habitat wow
johnson space center
houston houston texas thats right
yeah yeah 3d printed
simulate maybe would mar
print anything need
yeah cant carry right
cant carry need use
material possibly present
obviously regolith
know soil going
martian surface potential substrate
could use actually print
something um option course
clear regolith
think loosely say martian soil
soil strict meaning
earth mar whats
difference soil regolith
well there going mineral content
difference mar actually made
mineral earth
different component different
proportion youre going
different proportion mineral
present youre also going lack
moisture mar
water ice cap
potentially underground pretty
exciting actually
water content easily available
surface way soil would
know water content therefore
doesnt support biota soil
correct okay thats mark
watney get uh made poop
potato right yeah couldnt
grow soil isnt
isnt lot soil iron
well cant lot
actually build
habitat actually potentially
use uh create habitat might
actually uh protective
environment also potentially
protective radiation well
thats something construction material
thats great yeah exactly yeah long
378
day damn oh thats intense whoa
yeah hate let
honest cuz know like day three
youre like oh god
dude
aole there four
three name
yeah sure flight engineer ross
brockwell structural engineer
yeah medical
officer uh nathan
jones er doc really versed
emergency medicine
science office officer ana salario
actually microbiologist work
navy right wow right
combined
background right guy
make anything happen yeah sound like
nerdiest heist crew ever like
heist movie nerdiest crew
ever awesome
significant level nerd cant
lie yeah thats nerd know
hang love uh
get nittygritty
uh im big fan
twilight zone series going back
late 1950s actually original
original original original
uh uh jordan peele
version well maybe havent seen yet
cant comment yeah dont like
okay okay fine im sorry
remember dawn space age
right right many episode
made anyone yet
launched space knew
coming multiple episode
astronaut alone space
theyre exploring psychological
damage bring away
human right wasnt
older realized
know there long stretch time
dont want around anybody oh yes
im sociable person clearly
theyre like hermit
would issue right
father nasa always
yapping anyway right
idea isolation
devastating psychological
drama would u think know one
question come
isolating truly
mission like um isolating
thats testing
right people going handle
um say
incredibly isolating time also
opportunity get closer people
amazingly feel like actually
many relationship deepened
period um less
first nasa speak u
time significant
delay
well well good news
could type time
delay uh significant time delay
across mission based far mar
earth whole mission
22 minute one way
height time delay took 22
minute message get u
22 minute u send answer back
vice versa delay
radio wave moving vacuum
space right right witty
reparte nasa use im asking
use radio use like
kind laser communication
light doesnt make
difference speed
speed speed correct correct
okay built even
though youre sitting right
houston built time delay
absolutely data size also come
play actually
sending something large youre
sending larger item
youre going send audio file
video file even picture thats
going take longer typed
message sort
limitation sort
take account youre sending
message communication
nasa delayed
amount time email
email would also take account
generally size um yes actually
communication
schedule nasa um know set
u daily followed schedule
similar astronaut iss
basically check marked know
thing way
followed red line um sort
timeline thing
timely fashion also would
communicate back sometimes
troubleshooting wed ask
help wed wait
wed either troubleshoot
wait 22 minute
hear back
answer thats great way get
22 minute minute uh
want ask question
write back please clarify
go
coffee delay yeah exactly dont
understand please repeat didnt quite
get like right
guy know time
maxwell
badly behaved crew would
potentially would
never done
know sort follow
solution nasa let u know
um become
quite autonomous response
term communicating
family well delay
also like thing like video
uh intensely sort data heavy
hard minute two
really relied email audio
get talk people
way talk guess quote
know spent time
normally communicating
people actually put lot
friend family amazing
gave like richness
communication ive referenced
time really ste stepped
form dont use anymore
often communicated
way supported mission
actually ended
learning thing people
didnt know yet let ask
uh may seem bit juvenile
got ask im saying
happened want know
nasa policy come
uh know little like romance
happening uh crew member uh
guideline like find
warm feeling
somebody crew happens
something cu youre spending year
people happens
case nasa probably didnt cant speak
nasa tell
give u um information
one thing im
im sure im supposed say
say um pregnancy
like get pregnant
supposed get
pregnant mission would
imagine given earthbased
get pregnant would
removed mission potentially
im hypothesizing based
information maybe given um
also uh majority u
partnered would create
problem earth get warm
fuzzy feeling someone
think um know youre
professional setting um im
human human professional
setting lead relationship
time uh im im sure could
happen point lucky
enough deal anything like
uh however dont know um
know
youre analog youre
pretending mar youre mar
unless somebody get hurt cant
really step know theyre going
let mission go um unless certain
thing happen theyve outlined
ahead time would say luckily
didnt issue
brings something im actually
really interested future thought
around analoges also real mission
better send partner
there huge issue sending
partner term crew dynamic
term human happiness there
actually reason think sending
family know unit
people know youre
going threeyear mission oneyear
mission actually relatively short
mar going longer
thinking send couple
may actually viable way keep
people happier although admittedly
thats going crew
come together beforehand
there there inherent danger
crew dynamic part thats part
research part youre finding
youre finding yeah yeah
however would love see least one
uh experiment happens
couple want
see type back mission control
uh get
comfortable couch sent
um 9 month typically journey
mar simulating ride
mar simulating time
mar getting back pregnancy
issue movie
really called think space
u okay yeah woman
got pregnant night
flew mar oh shes delivers
arrival mar n9
month mission right nasa
keep whole thing
child born one knew
child child grew mar
40 gravity whole
story secret mar baby mar baby
love inter interesting hey star
talk fan dont know know
audio version podcast
actually post week advance
video version get
spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk much square
footage guy occupy oh 1700
square foot im done
sorry didnt kill
four people
habitat habitat
outdoor area went
mimicked mar walk um
obviously outfit
know mimicking space suit
actually little call going
outside loved going outside
habitat sometimes
week time didnt go outside
time um yes 1700 square foot
right go thats
sneak
mcdonalds didnt say
went oh simulating youre
houston girl guy guy im going
another mar walk come always
come back mar walk
ketchup suit whats 1
1700 sare ft could easily put four
people living manhattan
apartment yeah get exit
apartment multiple time day
new york city street
crowded there bunch
people living tiny little mar
ba impossible area
imagine putting people
urge go mar walk
houston go
walking like street
mar like
campus happens
within rate attached habitat
actually area covered um
made look like mar
actually exited habitat
stayed within defined area used
two different mechanism used virtual
reality actually goggles
treadmill got
able go activity associated
scientific activity also
maintenance activity would
expect um actually went
outside wait said goggles
mean vr goggles vr vr goggles yeah
like whole whole vr rig like like
know hand contr whole oh
gotcha gotta treadmill
pretend like actually walking
great distance cover ground cover
ground mean point ive walked
mile mar yeah oh thats super cool
actually kind feel like
little truman show yeah yeah
sky
horizon vr realism
excellent like vr team
amazing put together
really beautiful package set
activity u got um
nonvr little less realism
obviously youre hanger
houston thats pretending part
mar know little area
actually wasnt bad like really
activity given build
given different
activity outside um
combined outfit wore
really sort give sense
without environmental issue
mar lacking
like know cant youre
going mimic gra difference
gravity difference
could could could put joist
right make
little bit lighter yeah could
done youre youre right
um aspect like think
always think
analoges trying ask
trying mimic
workload would stress u
tire u thing
actually made physically mentally
tired actually know um
trying know equipment
actual mar mission know
addressing specific thing
scope
would really really cool
imagine another mission analog
mission
gravity part yeah would
amazing right really try
see would feel would
rig outside inside
would know resource wise would
quite heavy lift youd
mar youd 60 pound
right yeah sound right yeah
youd different
different experience got get
mar quickly goodness
thats work j dont
leave fat behind mar
man boob thats
im really problem
uh um course youre hanger
never exit hanger even
go walk figured
mean didnt see anyone
didnt hear people outside like
even though mean
weirdest feeling right enter
habitat enter space
youre going living 378
day know mission
control wall
door yet dont
see year dont speak
directly year dont hear
theyre quiet like
incredible labor
love
spent year working place
bone quiet like
quiet didnt actually
interfere mission wow
really strange like mean
analoges really funny way
buy
side right ground
ground mission space
planet mission
actually really
surreal thing scientist tell
like really
interesting thing see like u
drop like experience
everybody different approach
different way deal
know best um
mission real
giving best possible
data nasa thats key
right else giving year
life point
psychologically begin believe
cosplay going ask
involved mean
mar dont want
actually exit could mess
brain actually go daniel de
lewis u like know im
actually im know
build butcher like honestly say
wish could say um
think would actually made
really interesting experience well
think youre always
almost impossible turn brain
know youre earth
there num number difference
right like youre going
experience similar thing
aware youre
also youre determined
mission way set
think buy
experience deep way like
fact unit team
functioning together
continue functioning together
work properly forth
even think work right
like science setting
way science normally right
science actually produce
particular type data um
making data sake
actually producing data personally
actually making science um
want better word didnt matter
creating data different sort
kind layer
know youre dat
dat really really
science actually data
science data
know
yeah way also
twilight zone episode
actor okay
miserable home life acting role
joyous family loving kid
everything flipped one
day became actor
acting wow know took
wall thing
thats
twilight zone
street multiple time couple
thing
seem remember study
put people room
could live whatever
biorhythms natural dont
know thats right term
found 24 hour
natural unit people um
call circadium
rhythm like 25
half hour oh really
left
schedule shifted made
wonder life 24hour clock
forcing u away natural
martian day earth day
oh thats martian day martian
day little martian yeah
martian day would little longer
would actually perfect
would would actually speak study
um hypothesize
reason number one um
activity schedule right
autonomous like
cleaning hab maintenance
hab whatever um
personal time obviously
activity need expert
ground thats actually monitoring
u case there troubleshooting
right time similar
anyone thats going go space
trip also going
dependent crew houston
whatever space station who actually
monitoring stayed
earth clock im buying
send actual mission
mar folk jpl right mar
two clock wrist maring
time earth time yeah yeah many
soul sun sunday
theyre forced match circadian
rhythm rover
make make houston go
schedule dont dont well would say
experience think
experience um
nasa opinion
think experience
crew go mar going
far autonomous nasa
used like time delay mean
cant wait 45 minute answer
time go forward
troubleshooting solution
unless something put
changed later time
day youve heard
honest think
environment also delay
length time people going
feeling going
different style mission
even right
even though think theyre theyre
getting close trying actually
answer question safety health
analoges like time
go mar actually people
living think theyre going
like ironed
thing feeling
people biology going actually
know adapt supreme
end feeling
probably case um
analog stick earth time
yeah see would gonna
put away year gna follow
schedule thats yeah one
thats would get beligerant
exactly yeah right let
ask said cleaning hab
like guy divvy
duty group thing
get together like okay
put dust get swept
corner right yeah
somebody like kind slob like
jim many time going leave
space drawer middle
dog h whats man seriously
unit space
draw different kind draw
know youre
selfsufficient right food yeah
washing clothes everything
everything um
free supply certain location
could get thing delivered u
presup area depot
potentially time
retrieved thing um
resupply area thats simulation
supply ship would deposit
exactly uncrewed supply ship right
drop good exactly yes um
um instance thing
everything going
hab start
right getgo cleaning
supply inventoried
actually tremendous
braggy little bit
say like crew much stuff left
really like um
resource like tight
resourcing actually
abundance end
item really strict
reused thing like crazy
like recyclers like wouldnt believe
kind awesome
cleaning different
activity assigned
sometimes would would go
schedule would like know
commander fen flight
engineer today eva
would dictated schedule
nasa thing would nasa
never call space walking
say extra vehicular activity uh okay
know feel like slapping
okay okay fan
eva go okay yes
activity like like cleaning forth
would come together crew
beginning week look
activity sort either
assigned thought needed happen
would divvy
pretty fair system
kind kept track
last time cycled around
people didnt get bored also luckily
didnt see anybody space gi
yay great um
would good also
normal men okay
music
men left
know dro pant walk
around underwear day listen
seek lowest common denominator
existence thats thats
doesnt make difference know
mother said came
room like
going clean room went
question youre asking
time im talking reason
yeah dont dont see reason
right always hear
task everybody perform
particularly youre science
experiment timed right
movie night mean
whats
entertainment wow yeah crew
um little bit preloading
met evaluation
week choosing crew
preloading thats drink
go thats preing pregaming alol
pregaming yes pregaming
mission alcohol mission
preloading probably better term
pre pregame yeah pre yeah
preloaded preloaded got hey man
imma tell im preloading im
ready go start right
yeah pre pre
preloading forget pregaming
preloading okay interrupted go
thats okay uh really uh
collaborative getting together
mission um limited amount
data allowed
bring limited amount
personal item weight
limit personal item actually
made sure little
redundancy um movie
brought music brought
book etc etc really
actually combine resource
including like wanted
christmas holiday celebration
one person brought something
would appropriate u
right really trying like
actually really
big movie selection personal data
um watched dont even know
many watched
like seemed like every marvel movie
actually checklist went
like watch
movie
martian watch martian
read book already
one person read book
okay okay right
say uh andy
weir friend show weve
uh weve guest yes
handed highest compliment ever
received he
engineer turn novelist said neil
writing martian putting
good science said
imagined looking shoulder
right yeah well cuz know
point would trash
movie didnt want tweeting
point would
like uh clearly
physically possible dont
let watch movie titanic ocean
liner didnt watch maran
mar mar say didnt
watch um there
there tv show mar
actually watch uh im blanking
name right um
called like nasa
like alternate universe nasa oh
yeah thats mankind yes
man thats russian got
russian got moon first
course behind everything
including getting woman space
program whole deal bad
bad series actually yeah mean think
bumped woman people color
russian really
actually u good frankly
wom woman go space way
earlier um alternate universe
know solid state
disc like 300 movie
mean youre limited
many movie bring many
book would paper
live digital era sorry
talking uh ebooks
data size limit
uh data size
gave u could bring
personally um dont answer
give dont
want spending time watching
movie real simple
reason
kid limit time limit time
able device
right imagine though
mission majority data
want go mission priority item
right item going
support mission objective
stuff personal limited
going
personally bring way
uh limit weight many
clothes bring many personal
item bring bring com
guitar versus keyboard know
really love music versus
actually needle pointed brought
like sewing item needle pointed
everything could possibly think
mission including
chapo logo right behind
yeah guitar get bring
play room stop dont
subject rest u awful
guitar playing unless shes unless
youre really good okay yeah went
summer camp two week
television phone nothing allow
one guy bought guitar swear
wanted kill dude two
week cuz every night trying
poorly figure rendition
whatever playing oh terrible
terrible cuz bad
experience doesnt mean everybody else
got follow thats im
trying protect ever
wanted one question
universe answered question
universe black hole
quazars quantum entanglement wormhole
end depth cosmic
curiosity well entry level
patreon membership star talk get
think start 5
month access question

hayden planetarium think
would okay
another universe wouldnt happen
universe okay id
songwriter broadway musical oh
thats entry level perk
ascend uh there level
fact send autographed
copy one latest book uh right
star messenger cosmic
perspective civilization
signed fancy fountain pen
purple ink invite check
che link money
go ability experiment
new way bringing universe
earth thank
already joined welcome others
participate grand adventure
bring universe
earth always keep looking
speaking uh scientist
thinking
especially interesting
something
unforeseen happens oh martian bear
martian bear invades compound
something
unimagined new virus
exists four people
airspace year exactly
find extra set footprint leading
around back habitat whats
right like like okay
experiment explore
limit thats experiment
taken limit going discover
stuff oh thats cool thats whole
point yeah okay build james
web go weve never seen
expect discover stuff
weve never seen
discovered either anticipated
throw curve like
throw something
throw something like
know kind throw guy
kilter oh would good
want point experiment
there two mission
planned four people im im
stem cell biologist get work
hundred million cell
experiment right make make
different cell type tissue
human stem cell could make heart
cell set heart cell would
communicate
know created
interview exactly right could well
there issue youre
accumulation stem cell
turned commander kelly
clone thats talking
say even though four people
create ton data year
still four people additional
mission going add lot
complexity data set
complete yet um
cant really speak exactly
found yet longterm
experiment make grateful
im stem cell biologist
get much immediate answer
people studying u
theyre going wait year
um think um
really interesting finding
know sort interacted think
crew team
ground really inspired
solution came
thing happen u im
little bit vague
additional mission cant really
actually dont want tweak
give much um insight
whats going happen theyre
actually uh know
remain comparable u right prot
integrity setup exactly
analyzes data
produce work
sound like lot
information gathering
would data analyzed uh
social scientist psychologist
behavioral scientist
nasa publish
everybody see oh work
answer question
plethora
people nasa working
tremendous amount group came
together integrate study
design way people
thinking exercise people
thinking team dynamic
people thinking food uh
eating um biological
uh sampling throughout mission
data collected actually
vast across many different type
data group came together
actually integrate
end analyze
uh people c
said said biological think
collecting
poop im im afraid thats true okay wow
let ask uh thrilled
ill ill tell guy
seem like talk
thrilled pooping
container anymore okay okay yeah
gotta tell uh im
think would uh rather enjoy
experience im saying ive never
going space know
third mission still need
people think second mission might
closed could ready
apply third mission
mar analog astronaut like
put physicist hat ask
last think run
time physicist hat
370
day energy
source would responsible
imbuing food energy
grew food
nourishment warmth
youre heating food
energy come somewhere right
solar panel
front way would might
mar operating 12
hour day mar sun like
know half intense something
farther back farther back
energy budget cuz buck
stop
right exactly dont know much
answer tell
uh clean lot solar
panel maintenance
definitely aspect
built activity
clear mar there lot
dust storm dust land
solar panel dust
like like ump home plate
right got got get
clean panel yeah
thats natural thing youd
mar yeah okay go yes
similarly term uh
resourcing
functioned part
experimental design dont know
actually disclose
case given limitation
certain thing mission
interested something
measured throughout
mission probably
item actually
unblinded actually see
final data set three
mission element
little bit uh
low dont actually
disclose much think heard
uh nasa secret energy source
rest u privy oh
knew look look u
sucker burning fossil
fuel nasa luxuriating
special energy
source another thing clarify
since mission see
could generate food
module preloaded food
year worth food
food basically thats whats
iss dehydrated food
shelf stable food get
grow crop certain part
mission 1700 square
foot could use word
crop okay well potted plant
right youre
uh havent fresh
vegetable six month feel
like crop gotta man
happy eat would say um yes
small scale uh
grow area able supplement
um think idea
mission hope always
supplement people fresh
vegetable fruit
forth could lived
could lived
f
reason right ever like
virus come fungus
something like come
anything bacteria anything took
plant relying
would hosed right
mission go mar place
interstellar right blight hit
crop yeah yeah obviously youre
always going nasa thats
think one reason nasa
love analoges get ready
every event like eventual problem right
let test practice
safer space youre going
hurt people whats going happen
actually get
think chris hafeld said
really nicely like analoges
really make muscle stronger
area actually know
youre right
thats thats people
pretending mar
nasa who actually know preparing
way theyre getting
data keep u healthy
theyre also actually testing
keep team happy grow food
safely forth
there really cool aspect even
though there aspect like
know say tradeoff
think
resource think always want
always ask people ask
question like think
best money analog uh mission
like best bang
buck actually send people
place safely possible
keep public happy dont
want hurt people actually
take risk get know
place like mar oh think
tremendous exercise risk
management mean worth
nasa good
ever since found founding year
way mentioned chris hatfield
canadian astronaut probably
famous canadian astronaut he
guest star talk yes yeah
yeah even play guitar
space say said leave
guitar
home im even gna lie
kelly gota gota call
quits uh delight
get
three mission done youre
going repeat right although
would love like different form
like id like go antarctica next
like try analog
like thats different kind analog
would super cool
person ever heard life
say id love spend year
antarctica youre cut different
jy got right amount crazy
im tell im glad youre
side reminded
read discovery especially
involves human achieving goal
set forth others
general population government
whatever read
celebrate result somewhere
homework done
people came scientist
engineer uh test subject dont
always read dont always
read hard work went
prep final step taken
get medium attention
reminds
fundamental youre going
move frontier want
sensibly safely
unsung hero actually empowered
first place try
never lose sight yeah
neil armstrong buzz aldren walk
moon anytime ive said ive
said theyre one
walked moon 10000
scientist engineer uh know
200 million taxpayer walked
moon day uh delighted
hear early step
get taste make
sausage taste good
end uh commander kelly thanks
guest star talk thank much
real honor
want give shout crew
also chapia ground team
amazing group people put
experiment ground team whose
schedule
matched well well start movement
doesnt happen
future yes exactly
thank know take
month go like completely ofy
cycle know youre
like 30 minute right yeah yeah
month 12 hour yeah yeah anyhow
good uh commander kelly
thanks guest thank
much chuck always good man
always pleasure star
talk neil degrass tyson always
bidding keep looking
music
