know evolution full accident
contingency expect
planet probably photosynthesis
evolves like ability use sunlight
would expect humanoid like
going mistake like oh wow
know earth
think nothing going similar
would look like able
convey message communicate
another intelligent life form
mathematics kind
universal language seems sort
built universe something
weve created much something weve
discovered mathematics
thing give u hope able
establish connection
music
intelligence star talk neil
degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist chuck nice
chuck man whats happening
neil right comedian also
acting yes im stealing
money thats im stealing money
neil dont even know dont
even make people laugh
hand money giving money
im like dont even know im
acting like
comedian ill take
check today chuck got cosmic
query thats fan favorite cosmic
query yeah oh gosh one
favorite guest yes help u
excited back got dr funky
spoon dr funky
spoon david grinspoon longtime friend
colleague kind came
together graduate school
sort different side
fence sort galaxy
cosmology like planet
asteroid
stuff thats like jet
shark right
put context right
telescope would reach
galaxy telescope
would see planet
started going planet still
astronomy go see
part divide
go bring back sample
stuff youre youre lab
technician well observe
first look
something see first david grinon
welcome back star talk dude oh thanks
lot really great see guy
uh pleasure always
yeah divide uh planetary
astrophysics kind funny
mean interesting
evolved historically time
kind intense like know
grad school planetary science
astronomy department across
street professor like oh dont
go know
exoplanets need
ever knew yeah yeah
there there meeting
melding mind heart
soul absolutely also preeminent
journal astrophysical journal
ordering dont still
havent paid attention
ordering article every
released issue
descending order distance earth
start cosmic microwave
background large scale structure
universe go active keep
way bottom observation
saturn like clearly
prioriti prioritization universe
writ large page thats
david noticed title
didnt last time first
youre youre astrobiologist get
youre also senior scientist
astrobiology strategy nasa
yeah thats thats
new job since last time really
good conversation guy
started new role uh know ive
always worked nasa um
supported nasa research
mission im involved
whole career year ago
uh week started new job nasa
gman work
government look yeah see
youll never take alive
ca uh working uh nation
space agency helping uh run
astrobiology program like
say im astrobiology strategy
really trying understand um
uh figure expand
astrobiology new way plot
future um really interesting uh
role fascinating
different mean feel like
career point preparing
lot way
fundamentally different
job ive
year feel like im still learning
rope dont power
mission
decadal survey uh help shape
priority set yeah
dont yeah absolutely like say
decal survey know
big community input uh exercise
set priority know
decadal time scale public
understands never see astro
folk publicly arguing money
spent among
like private well yeah like
like good
marriage know mean
set like major priority
take foundational
document know way
marching order within there
lot decision made
prioritize different research uh
area um direction uh know
put emphasize
communicate
decal kind defines shape
acting within within
there lot uh lot decision
made know
uh working community
represent astrobiology community
like oh idea
today nasa im
going go know course
hopefully interjecting
creativity idea
work really working lot
community um kind moving
far come dc kick
as well
exactly exactly know im im
public servant know
interesting different kind
creativity
research im putting lot
time facilitating um people
research figuring
creatively get group people working
together new way helping
know create connection people
think theyre
separate thing trying get
see working together whole
greater sum part
real new kind um
feel like tapping new sort
creativity thats uh
kind need even expect
following mission statement
thats established
strategic plan yeah
mentioned there there decal
survey um know there
there planetary science
astrobiology decal survey
different astrophysics decal
survey although know play
well together um beyond
there actually something called
astrobiology strategy
10year document much
detail research priority
forth part im
big big part working
new astrobiology strategy
actually starting canvas
community astology researcher
say hey priority
next decade solve right
find
life thats know thats thats
big goal know
give u detail want u
trying fill
fill step here
funny thing guy always
looking life ever thought
creating like maybe
progenitor like know look
like prometheus like
ah know alien came left
know microorganism
water made u oh mean
prometheus movie movie abel
alien catch people
scifi fluence thats
scifi yes ever u maybe
alien create see life
elsewhere funny ask
people working um
well obviously there people
working sort origin life
experiment necessarily theyre
literally trying create uh organism
organism theyre trying recreate
chemical step help u understand
life started thats know
thats astrobiology support lot
kind uh experimentation
people actually trying work
synthetic life like could create
kind life form know
really interesting idea thats
certainly something thats avenue
towards learning lot life
could clear
someone say made synthetic
leather mean leather
kind look smell like
leather youre going say synthetic
life youre making
ingredient life made
youre actually making life right
word synthetic
mean different thing
people wrong thing p
term person first hearing
ph maybe want say artificial
uh know laboratory created
thats thats major effort
astrobiology certainly
something people
thinking related
question uh know alien life
people predicted
know sort provocatively maybe
theyre right first alien life
discover come know
something made laboratory know
say well really
alien come earth
pretty alien way made yes
impossible meat
alien yeah exactly
call turkey made
toer yes
fy hey star talk fan dont know
know audio version
podcast actually post week
advance video version
get spotify apple podcast
podcast cast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic start david
guest recently roboticist
describing collaboration nasa
search life
subsurface enceladus know
enceladus striking
plume see sort
side view properly lit
sun see sort geyser coming
he working folk nasa
make worm robotic worm thatll go
hole look around
life frozen top
sort liquid water
presume know
need permission
need blessing
need fishing
license mecker right he got got
license mean yeah put
certainly uh put resource
um experimental speculative
engineering project could someday
lead um new way new kind
mission search life place
like enceladus thats lander
know usual right thats
current know mission thats
plan like definitely going
part strategy
support people innovative concept
could lead future mission
certainly enceladus one place
thats high list place
would like visit
characterize habitability
perhaps search life reason
mentioned neil seems like
place liquid water
interior hint
ocean based weve seen
plume suggests chemistry
interior ocean may really
conducive life may right
mix chemical source
energy biogenic element
know right element make life
hint
ocean enceladus might
good stuff definitely
high list place
intend explore know never
asked guy
um icy crust frozen right
underneath liquid ocean
making warm underneath
liquid ocean
clearly um like
goldilock zone outside
frozen crust yeah well know
big surprise planetary
exploration many moon
outer solar system
warm active interior didnt expect
maybe
smarter know physic
work
thought would sent
spacecraft jupiter saturn
thought theyd greater
dead ice ball turn
near giant planet way
moon interact uh
flex interior basically
tide interior getting squished
um make certainly place like
uh europa keep interior warm
keep know pumping heat
basically gravitational influence
giant planet there also
place rocky core
moon rocky core source
natural heat radioactivity
rock combination
natural radioactivity tidal
history moon like
warmed
interior remember enceladus im
entirely moon fluent enceladus
memory serf orbit saturn correct
correct okay yeah
last last checked yeah like uh
im giving one neil
dont sorry thought
pausing dramatic effect
neil degrass tyson say solidus
orbit saturn correct im going think
thats rhetorical shut
thats going jupiter
shortage moon got tily
heated moon got moon ice
everybodys favorite europa right
jupiter half distance
compared saturn would
saturn moon priority
relative jupiter moon
cassini saturn know
orbiter really brought
moon u turned really
surprising thing probably
biggest surprise enceladus
weird weird enticing
way seems people
think best candidate
finding extent life people think
even better candidate europa
dont want get fight
going europa
clipper mission great
europa promising place
look whats amazing
enceladus mentioned
geyser literally know
like uh shooting gut
space stuff ocean
landing surface people think
go enceladus scoop
snow surface look
organism snow never
go liquid right
ocean accessible
literally squirting space
heard know
chemistry like hydrogen cyanide
right hcn something yeah yeah
sound like oh thats poison
actually youre thinking
origin life
primitive life may need
juicy chemical whenever youve
got nitrogen bound carbon
molecule thats know basis
much thats basis amino acid
stuff hydrogen cyanide
actually promising sign youre
looking life somewhere
clear kill ingest
youre talking formation
life clear yes yes
dont dont try home
giveth taketh away go
chuck hydrogen c think
thats gas gas chamber
variant uh youre saying
car hydr hcn c n together
really thats whats fertile
organic chemistry thats thats enticing
thats know know one
thing weve learned there
carbon molecule everywhere
mean many place universe
encouraging astrobiology
hard know universe
like make carbon molecule
great need certain thing beyond
carbon bonded nitrogen
key biochemistry know
see natural
environment go hey thats know
thats encouraging right
whats attracting people
right got interesting
cosmic query episode chuck
collected david may remember
cosmic query tell people
youre going theyre reminded
expertise come
question inspired
curiosity work
uh let see got chuck okay
got uh let start brad
lester uh brad lester say hello dr
tyson dr grinspoon mr nice didnt
get memo lord part
brad
okay chuck paying customer oh
thats right thats right nice
way thank uh
supporting u patreon certainly
appreciate uh appreciate
even appreciate
money letting know
okay clear
call mr nice must must
new member dont know
history thats true thats true
called nice new folk
nice thats right he new
got super super nice ive
heard scientist speak
unlikely intelligent life
evolve humanoid form
planet said study
devoted likelihood
exoplanets might contain tree
plant structure comparable
tree tree like flora existing
elsewhere universe reasonably
likely assume sentient life
could also evolve planet
reasonable conclude
organism would evolve
limb hand finger similar
appendage allow spread
tree heavy environment maybe im
mistaken isnt reason
primate evolved first place
thus human contain two arm two
leg
grab thing know damn
thats thought
going thought
thought senent tree like
ring thats
good question get guy
next guest
show mean like he
asking something call
convergent evolution like know
one hand know evolution full
accident contingency know
like uh step j g used say ran
tape wouldnt get
biosphere there much
randomness would expect anything
since evolution
random opposite
certain thing
see earth evolved similarly
different environment multiple time
make sense solve
problem evolution
solving problem right
expect planet probably
photosynth evolves like ability
use sunlight
universe there star
environment know thats
great source energy
photosynthesis youre g
organism spread
something like leaf capture
going
something like branch thats
sort natural know
make argument yeah would
thing like tree similarly
say well there going
humanoid would
unlikely would expect alien
look like u go
characteristic like
head make sense one central
processing system brain two
eye make sense know stereo
vision yeah like uh
questioner astutely said something
grasp swing tree branch
know would expect humanoid
like going mistake
say oh wow know
earth think nothing going
similar right
characteristic common um there
rationale one
fascinating thing ever
ever get meet complex alien
thats well answer question
know speculating like
finding theyre like
say way dont
actually uh mean uh dont
necessarily uh evolve hand instead
limb could evolve tentacle
right right right david
think convergence wouldnt
specific youve would say
um there
convergent uh convergent evolution
enable organism sense thing
distance u sight uh
there ver version sight
right uh insect see
dont retina eyeball situation
see sure right
lotion dont talk leg
arm move tree cant
move okay least mean one
wizard oz think chased
dorothy street
think threw threw apple
threw apple yeah
locomotion need
valuation talent
snake arm leg
yet move along fine
think come world
physic im im dont
urge specific
much accomplishes yeah
absolutely mean fascinating
question youre right
need met thats
evolution
case earth though specific
thing like like eye evolve
yes know say thats
planet
condition know mean think
speculate love
astrobiology exploration
thats well find answer
going seeing
chuck give tom
lelus sweden say greeting
sweden say greeting
sweden okay
uh yes chuck thank
interpreting right
say bey bey bey bey uh
said right
anyway say already know
neils favorite alien movie
blob favorite alien
movie dr funky spoon
think first
encounter actually bigger
microbe might look like
encounter alien let clarify
thats favorite favorite
alien movie favorite alien right
clear
bone skin mouth eye
teeth hair finger think
creative alien ever put
screen look nothing like
life form earth
youre going come visit another
planet look like human
either human look like
anything else earth youre
creative hollywood right yeah
want know david whats
favorite mean give
two answer thats okay
term favorite im old school
favorite movie go
back 2001 part
neil say know
show
alien theyre going look cheesy
matter 2001
brilliant thing implying without
really showing uh pretty
mindblowing way way im told
might insight
carl sean time though young
advised producer film
show alien leave
imagination fact preserved
novel contact
screen version least dont see
alien yeah thats ab
became way think thats
absolutely right think know uh
rumor story
sean kubri didnt really get along
well carl didnt much
input film one
substantive piece advice
followed dont show alien
earlier draft
going try always
brilliant storytelling ploy
leave thing imagin
think jaw dont see shark
long movie right
right youre right youre
right neil thats
contact brilliant effect um
one depiction thats coming mind
alien organism movie
think pretty good arrival um
know seid oh
sept true
didnt saw day ago
count awesome awesome like odd
odd number good um
know theyre kind floating
behind frosted glass
atmosphere sort see
there nothing
seems like fake
implausible im like yeah look
like alien give high
give high point high mark yeah
miss ray gun stuff like
know yeah
yeah well yet said two
movie arrival way there
another movie arrival charlie
sheen playing astrophysicist
yes youre talking
recent one
yeah physicist linguist
decode amy adam amy adam yes yes yes
thats recent one
year ago whats film
youre charlie scene one way
underrated let say
charlie sheen one pretty cool
climate change oh
okay ill go back check yeah
right go ahead one
already mentioned 2001 said thats
sort foundational one thats
know like alien
dont see
nice uh ivan ivon duza
say hello doctor lord
greeting abu dhabi united arab
emirate longtime fan recent patreon
member well thank uh question
jupiter moon europa cant help
wonder life may possibly find
vast ocean insulates
icy surface yes ruling
impossibility really want
think find
form please visit
side world uh side
world would love take yall around
okay
go love open standing invitation
existed frequently
world imagine much peace
would there
invitation awaiting right wall
preventing
kind forward thinking gesture
gonna put door wall there
door yeah love love
fact kind question make
obvious
side thinking
whats know thats
great whats best whats best
thinking europa thats
get everybodys imagination
sure like europa uh 2010
sequel
2001 europa shown several
storytelling uh effort there another
one called europa
report film lower budget
scifi film know
im oh get
interesting short cameo
simple clipped
something cnn
clip cant wait go ice fishing
europa cut hole ice put
camera lens see
anything swim lick think
entire quote love
lick lick camera could imagine
giant europan tongue like
yeah europa one place
thats imagination
long time actually
cameo um episode six
original um cosmos carl sean um
traveler tale show scene
um jpl voyager 2 showed
first closeup europa ever
seen spacecraft somehow carl
convinced know let
camera crew room
happening im actually
undergraduate intern skinny kid
giant afro holding clipboard
back scene screen
like three
frame um mom poster
know circle
arrow course course yeah
europa know 1979 summer
1979 know europa
came attention like really
weird world clear cosmos
released 1980 filmed
moment took place 1979 yeah
know saw voyager uh
moon visible crater
surface tell young
there hasnt sitting
getting hit weird line turned
know cross turned
crack thin ice shell
ocean liquid water weve
learned seems ocean
probably probably right kind
chemical support kind
metabolism know
encouraging imagine life
form whats really cool
going back um
interrupt chuck uh said
thin coat ice let get
quantify thin mean maybe
maybe 10 100 kilometer
oh little thin
little okay
know dangerous ice go ice skating
would would fall
um clear im
trying truth advertising
thin ice david mouth
object world size
moon got 10
kilometer ice deep ocean
thats might probably
solar system largest ocean liquid
water water earth
impressive way far
know life earth began
ocean absolutely mean must
begun water either ocean
pond know think maybe hot
spring bottom ocean
actually thats really interesting
probably hot spring
know like uh vent c4
vent bottom europa ocean
think fed tidal energy
talking earlier
sending spacecraft back
go well launching later year
called europa clipper going
orbit jupiter make lot close
pass europa examine
question habitability
look thing like
pocket water ice shell
would one place could
life
chemical coming surface
chemical coming
ocean kind mixing
thats one place could
sh nasa astrobiology strategist
go back jupiter keep
orbiting isnt high time wed land
delay
there couple thing um
uh
difficult one point wanted
maybe orbit europa rather orbit
jupiter dude landed saturn moon
titan come dont tell
cant land jupiter moon europa
hyans wasnt even supposed
touch die right
last 45 minute sur
dont want europa
eventually way want send
lander europa budget
decided
want first characterize
europa much carefully one thing
want know land want
know safe want
pick right spot cant
without surveying weve done
100 kilometer thick youre falling
youre falling
dont want land wrong spot
like oh
thats interesting stuff
lot people dont know
know apollo program
visible entire uh lunar uh
ranger ranger series
photographed entire surface
moon enable people study
figure best landing site
would right right
homework famous word
spoken thing
thats interesting might say well
arent going orbit
europa rather orbit jupiter
make lot pass europa
europa
orbiter studied problem
jupiter radiation field intense
youre distance
youre europa distance jupiter
thats pretty close jupiter
would get fried dont mean
mean electronics dont survive
long intense radiation
orbit jupiter
spend time farther youre
thing like sending image back
earth thing
make quick close pass
europa dash
radiation retreat safety
enough time
build really detailed map
different quality want
study europa image spectrum
gravity data radar data thats
going tell u whats underneath
ice radio data going
tell u ocean salty
looking conductivity
quickly close pass
retreat sure cant wrap
vessel one blanket
dentist
wear
land well believe
thing even even
said radiation harden biggest danger
radiation radiation
hardened component vault
something thats literally
called vault radiation
hardened container
electronics even
still get way much dose wow
reminds monster
movie japan 1950s 60
think many uh
got way radiation
yeah course let soon
forget japan country
ever nuclear weapon used
right idea radiation
would create next world order
giant monster
cinematic evidence godzilla
europa go well funny
though um know think
radiation going like
destroy everything there going
life europa course
underneath uh ice shell
ocean shielded radiation
radiation
interacting surface ice
way actually make europa
habitable
radiation hit know h2o ice
knock hydrogen leaf
behind oxygen ox oxidized
compound ice
make way time ocean
could source energy
ocean thats coming indirectly
radiation like
godzilla earth europens may fueled
radiation indirect way wow
ever wanted one question
universe answered
question universe black hole
quazars quantum entanglement
wormhole end depth
cosmic curiosity well entry level

already joined
welcome others participate
grand adventure bring
universe earth always
keep looking chuck
minute let let see
tighten answer
lambin say question um neil
chuck david could one definitive
understanding anything life
another planet would like
understand oh look
get one get one okay got one
want know encode information
want know create
global technological civilization
uh survives long term survives
assumes intelligent
question didnt require right right
right right think think neil
would like kind covered
gam well guy miss
want know uh
weapon thats thats want
know better gun
theyre better gun
contacting
uh patrick uh weglinski
patrick weglinski say hello dr grom dr
grinspoon dr tyson lord nice
patrick salt lake city utah
colleague algorithm
characterizing something thats
alive id imagine found life
far away planet evolved
vastly different environment could
hard directly compare life
earth therefore make difficult
say whether indeed life
yeah david whats
biologist current stand
definition life definition
life evolved yeah yeah thats right
know could
could long answer keeping
short people people still
argue
another one thing well
much sophisticated
find life know brief
something reproduces uh
evolving something like darwinian
evolution okay uh except find
life form perfectly suited
environment would never
evolve would never discover
evolution always
doesnt sound like much
fun though
neil right chuck give another
quick david guer david guer say
greeting dr tyson dr funky spoon lord
nice david gerer crescent iowa
anyone updated estimate
number active extraterrestrial
civilization postulated drink
equation given enormous amount
data available love
quick thing book
copublished year ago two
fellow professor cotaught course
princeton uh called
welcome universe actually give
latest estimate number
technologically capable civilization
galaxy maybe
eight year ago uh david
would say latest number
give give galaxy several
hundred billion star give
mean know first answer
question people updating
time requires
lot assumption um parameter
dont know fundamentally
dont know answer drake
equation know really meant
medium discussion
different factor would influence
answer way calculate
definitive answer um know
remind people drake
equation start number
star hack away
fraction fraction star
planet fraction
star planet life
fraction life
intelligent life fraction
life intelligent life
technology sort thing
time hack away
fraction there much
start big enough number
left come
got least one give
number well know there one
think
unless consider know could
debate whether intelligence
civilization resend intelligence
status yeah yes yeah know
there many know hate
come number love
like talk possibility
asked come
personal number wearing nasa hat
dr funky spoon david
grinspoon hat would say um would say
th thousand civilization
galaxy thousand huge error
bar range zero million
know right fraction
civilization would suggest
might considerably advanced
okay good okay
many would
still around there
possibility many come
gone yeah thats thats
estimate current number
want talk um one
ever course going
larger number
although although tend think uh
trying keep
answer short tend think
certain threshold success
last really longevity
get huge pas sort
unstable immature phase arguably
make point
youve learned
sustainable know enough
get wiped longevity know
stick around get
teenage year
yes got damn good chance making
mature brain set
make adulthood youre
probably gonna okay right well
quite yet unfortunately chuck
got time one last question
squeeze okay al righty uh
star eyed mama say greeting
doctor grinspoon tyson lord nice
mathematics universal language
would look like able
convey message communicate
another intelligent life form cant wait
watch live columbus ohio
fall dr tyson im grateful fan
maria gail already bought ticket
bro thats amazing yeah coming
columbus ohio yeah generally dont
give speaking schedule publicly
gotta go find didnt
give free give free
free free patreon pas exactly going
get p going get
patreon pass uh
maria right go ahead dr funky
spoon yeah well star mama um
mathematics universal language
feel like much much
harder task trying establish
understanding creature
share common
universe origin
seems know
interesting philosophical question
mathematics kind
universal language seems
sort built universe
something weve created much
something weve discovered thats
correct presumably
intelligence could
discovered mathematics
creates basis know like even
think twodimensional know
way making
twodimensional message send send
circle perfect circle
least know thats another mind
nothing made randomly
youve established mind youre
mind trying communicate
start get sophisticated
mathematics thing
give u hope able establish
connection circle
everywhere large planet
thing would send triangle
natural triangle yeah well
right circle ubiquitous
something encoding digital
message make circle thats like
oh got got know first idea
communicate alien know
surely know david
like making giant triangle
fire siberian forest something
exactly
create right triangle big
earth got right
angle two angle okay
remember pythagorean
theorem chuck um 180 degree well
sum three angle 45
45 90 b c three
remember right yes b c c
hypoten okay okay whats
brilliant okay make triangle
big got
got able ignite mean
blow light fire
see night side
earth thats lit right
alien could see thats first
get right triangle okay
fill side triangle
square okay one side triangle
side square
create square three square
side tri triangle would
area one square
plus area square
equal area third square
know thats pythagorean
theorem 2 b 2 c 2 whats area
square one dimension time
dimension link like
trigonometry geometry
get alien say oh there
there intelligence right
alien say intelligence
theyre like well uh clearly
smart enough figure
gupan
theorem however dumb enough
burn whole damn planet trying
show u
wouldnt wouldnt cool
like first time get direct
imaging picture exoplanet
super duper space telescope thats
see amazing gupan would
gupan theorem thats thats
good one chuck gotta keep
david got call quits
remind remind u book
wrote pluto year back
whats title oh yeah chasing
new horizon alan stern oh
together excellent
subtitle oh oh gosh want
remember subtitle
inside chasing new horizon inside
epic first mission pluto okay thats
mission pluto stop
trying number
number
far find also like
youre musician like dr funk
spoon thats moniker
musical mon yeah find
youtube know usual
usual channel think
archive playing
guitar thats right
astrobiology blue ch chuck
wrote together yeah thats
oh archive dig
one good right chuck good
man always pleasure right
uh neil theg grass tyson yet another
installment cosmic query one
one dr funky spoon
well see next time always keep
looking
