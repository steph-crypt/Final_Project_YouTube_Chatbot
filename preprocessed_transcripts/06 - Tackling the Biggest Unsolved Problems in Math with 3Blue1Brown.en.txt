like people dont know
exists revolution
math 19th century kind
changed way think math
beginning born
question trying solve
polomial equation realizing hey
maybe impossible like pure
mathematician curious
okay hey far take
1500s kind
initially explored
cubic everything around
1800s people tried one could find
way answer wait tell
people thought thought
1500s others disembowing
heretic yeah two thing
coexisted wild contrast
history science yeah
music
star talk cosmic query
edition got chuck nice chuck
man great
yeah yeah one going
math oh told would
math
thats
music
nobody told going
math thats right
know math going
math subject got
bring big gun right especially
mathiest math
weve got u first time
star talk grant sanderson grant
welcome back hey thanks
fun first time let
see go excellent excellent
sort academic chop
math computer science right
related level
took road mean
took youtube yeah highly
followed channel three blue one brown
get cryptic yes
sound uh sound like threecard
montys meme thats right
long channel man
around 10 year uh
feel little wild yeah many
follower follower
around 7 million um remember
sometime recently across know
thats thats monumental term
accomplishment im saying
got 7 million people follow
math math thats im saying
exactly 7 million people give
u give hope future
civilization yeah give hope
seven million people
future rest
general people like math
people suspect think like
little bit little bit
underdog everyone think people hate
like think everyone love
math think people
intimidated intimidate
nobody want feel stupid like
feeling dumb thats im
show im always dumbest person
show thats grant exists
uh grow comfort zone
people feel look
encountering content yes let
pick broad deep
topic math get qampa
hear occasionally problem
math theyre talking
whats 8 7 theyre talking
problem deepest thinker
field attempted solve
century
right like
book latest unsolved problem
math thats uh nerd geek
yeah check
library first yeah yeah mean
there there there many
mean one famous um body
unsolved problem uh year 2000
clay math institute put
seven problem offered 1
million prize one
kind celebrity among unsolved
problem theyre called like clay
millennium math problem
typically hard even describe
problem stating um
classic cant even describe
problem problem youre supposed
solve right got solve
problem cant even describe
nobody tell problem
sir thats keep
million dollar yes going
say sound lot like
married know
problem even
beginning solve um
there also celebrity unsolved
problem sense less
important theyre easier state
result theyre lot fun
engage
public there there prize
money right like
explicit sense
particular institute like put
check behind like ab
solved problem gain
certain fame within math world
probably youre academic
really bolster career
like there there plent want
financial reward there like plenty
would come could um solve
one problem course
thats people care
arise purely within math
scientific pumping
problem engineering
solution yeah ill give one
thats purely within math um
like come
outside world um first one
near dear
remember dont know maybe
11 dad across
kitchen like pipe he like
hey grant um know prime
number im like oh yeah prime
number like number
cant divide two smaller piece
like 6 2 3 seven cant break
two smaller piece he
like yeah think there
infinitely many
two apart like 11 13 prime
two apart 29 31
pair prime two apart um
asking cuz
reading news article
mentioned hey unsolved
problem dad asked
question question 11
oh wow either really
smart really bad dad
im letting go think im
like oh like true
eventually didnt take long
say like oh thing
reading like science
news magazine like mentioned
problem nowhere one world
know answer
fascinating like here here
question ask like teach
kid prime number maybe
everyone remembers grow
older like common topic um
youre asking hey
infinitely many two apart
ever stop coming um spaced
two know prime get
little sparer like get much
bigger there fewer um
might wonder stop clumping
way uklid asked two
millennium ago still dont know
answer cut pretty deep
like um understanding prime
lack
understanding able answer
question like thats pure
math okay puzzle hey
got one science yeah thats
great yeah mean one thats um
im going able state
exact nature question
give like high level
overview know neil youre
going know um there set
equation describe fluid flow
theyre famous theyre called
navi equation yeah yeah
youre youre modeling
fluid um understand certain
aspect know pressure
viscosity thing like there
something example could tell
computer try run forward
simulation um theoretical
understanding equation like
worryingly thin respect
example entirely known
um would imply like get
infinite concentration energy
point dont like clearly
shouldnt happen dont think
would happen physical
world mathematical model
used pure landscape
called differential equation
got property people arent
sure whether fall one way
another um actually
hard understand specific type
differential equation
wont phrase specific nature
question thats unsolved broadly
speaking basic question
equation behave
way would hope would
behave one actually know
clearly motivated modeling physic
modeling world also
category problem
unsolvable
yet people think
solved right prove
somethings unsolvable correct
everyone might seen school
quadratic equation um
something
expression look like x2 plus
constant x plus constant equal 0
want solve
systematic way
equation come time
engineer um time like
computer graphic programming
solving equation like left
right there formula lot
kid memorize school
called quadratic formula
formula known really
long time chuck recite quadratic
formula remember here
quadratic formula uh get
number 13
looking shoulder mean
remember getting drilled
u level prevented
appreciating actually
right memorizable
formula like b plus minus
square root b 2 minus 4 c 2
get right thats exactly
right yeah okay okay
wrote cuz freaking feeling
know many
time yeah got eighth grade
came okay here something
thankful exists
formula solve cubic equation
teacher never made u
memorize much longer yeah
would take much longer
song think
quadratic formula thing
would cause wrote engagement math
instead substantive one forcing
kid memorize cubic would even
worse um like pure mathematician
curious okay hey
far take know
formula solves um
equation highest power x
x 4th even
even monstrous uh formula
tried write full
would fill like entire page
formula solves degree 4
long time natural question
okay solve degree 5
equation um 1500s
kind initially
explored cubic everything
around 1800s people tried
one could find way answer
wait tell people
thought 1500s others
disembowing heretic
yeah two thing coexisted
wild contrast history
science well maybe stopped
1500s renaissance kicking
exactly im thinking maybe like
dark age mhm well go
right part world know one
person contemplating cubics
definitely find another part
world disembowings happen
skipping punch line
ill tell little bit story behind
answer ended um
literally impossible appropriate
sense like youre trying write
formula using usual symbol
plus minus time divide maybe
allow root thing like
operation
disposal literally never
able write formula degree
5 higher um two young
mathematician one make
initial step work
fourth order polinomial fifth
suddenly five stop yeah
stop working wow there deep
reason um discovery
one thing gave
birth huge part modern math
called abstract algebra like
people dont know exists
revolution math
19th century kind changed
way think math
beginning born
question trying solve
polomial equation realizing hey
maybe impossible get
certain point whats reason
symmetry break
four five neil would love
much able like give
pathy answer thats like here whats
true four thats true five
um struggled year
think something could
even like 50inute video something
like compellingly describes
want full youtube video desk
monday morning explaining
would would make lot
people happy okay im going
give im going give answer
uh make sense
promise there sense
true something called
galwa theory um one
young mathematician came uh
argument led explaining
name everest gowa died
duel age 20
big headline fact knew going
lose duel night
duel like like
brain dump page oh
story
classic story tell
lecture hall thats insane yeah
okay wait let let man explain go
ahead well youre
saying everyone hears
theyre learning physic learning
math whatnot like wrote
like compiling
stuff tried get published
like three four time
stuff written stuff
gotten front
famous mathematician like forier
koshi pan like seen
beginning work
wasnt like first time he ever
jotting like crazed
preduel state good
story tell way right
good like knew he going
die uh know he got get
idea way he got
classic story behind term
duel math
one thing
showed impossible
solve equation degree five
higher also showed
impossibility there classic
problem um tricing angle using
straight edge compass take
angle divide three piece
theory like new math
prove thats possible um
simply hard describe right
podcast gave
birth whole field math
central math also particle
physic day wow cool man
well math language
universe shouldnt surprised
spillage cosmic discovery
yeah make sense bring
question way audience
yeah yeah yeah let uh here
first question uh buck rice
say cant divide zero
love thats great
question ive carried
whole life right answer
well undefined
response well define right get
douff define yeah
exactly define know
uh mathematician actually
part math um one
particular called projective geometry
uh one object
essentially want get
idea 1 divided 0
thought number line
walk infinitely far either
left right there
unified point youre approaching
called point infinity um
useful math defining
thats kind youre
getting notion
one divided zero youre
want say like
isnt defined depends
youre division right
want say division
like know one
cupcake im dividing among three
people many get
youre like third cupcake
one cupcake im dividing among
zero people like
incoherent question like cupcake
got go somewhere fact
question incoherent maybe
mean saying undefined see
thats thats point practical
term one cupcake want
divide zero people got
go back beginning
statement one cupcake okay
thats answer chunk answer
eat cupcake
defined defined

successfively answer
okay hi kira georgia
u uh opinion
fascinating unsolved mathematical
problem cosmology understood
could fundamentally change view
universe hold gavin bamber
say hey gavin north
vancouver uh please visit neil uh
whats favorite unsolved math
question would illustrate
one uh fundamentally change
way view universe part
b personal uh favorite
unsolved wait cant say one
part b either one two
b see
new kind math
music
tell im going punt
part one neil um ill
humility im sure
important mathematical
problem cosmology im much
cosmology person im curious
say singularity
problem universe right
equation tell u
center black hole nature
dividing zero right okay
everything go denominator go
zero right happens value
everything else say there
infinite density infinite
doesnt even make sense
doesnt dont know
suspect thats limit
application theory
universe limit invocation
math right cuz
first blame math im
saying gotcha math badass
okay going
take blame first
true certain discovery
math led discovery
astrophysics need non
uklidian geometry
curvature spacetime
flat ukitian geometry
flat came
curved geometry remon big one
remon
like 1800s sometime yeah
1800s um like maybe 50 let say
okay right 19th century uh
tool think curved
geometry immediately uptook
uh cosmologist think
could geometry
universe needed way talk
thats got
math leading u
u finding math problem thats
solved well mean bring reman
talking nonremanian geometry
he also source going
answer part b
question one favorite unsolved
problem there part one part
b part one part b remon um
know lot geometry
stuff also one father
complex analysis basically using
complex number um solve
problem within math one
paper number theory thats
described prime number earlier like
twin prime conjecture um
one paper put think
1857 um prime number
otherwise doesnt number
theory completely changed
whole field basically said
hey here continuous function
doesnt feel like prime
discreet like
continuous got complex number
make different
understand function completely
understand prime um day
call reman zeta function
used greek letter zeta um
basically said hey
really really well understand
prime distributed um
understand something
function put conjecture
want solve
function equal zero
didnt know solve
guess solution
called remon hypothesis
hypothesizing one
milliondollar problem clearly
beautiful question
kind asking like
prime number form chord certain
sense study based
frequency information nobody know
answer dig
question paint really
really beautiful picture
favorite unsolved problem think
favorite yeah think wow okay
sounded like make
sound elegant sounded
little bit excited talking
love yeah okay
right tony isaac tony
say good day astro nail lord
nice tony melbourne
australia melbourne melbour
melbourne um say love show
uh go chuck aussie
accent okay thats somebody who
listening show
listening long yeah yeah
totally telegraphed right
say complex problem um
complex number
square root 1 doesnt exist
used much math
predicts thing accurately including
quantum fry brain hope neil
grant help thanks
yeah grant im going lead
saying label
number imaginary
god worst name
worst name ever gaus proposed
calling lateral number would
know little better
add another
aspect imaginary number get
complex number call
complex word
complete turnoff blame well
mean thats ibm youre
people going say thats
case need go way
back beginning call
math problem want
deal problem mean many
people struggle right
label imaginary
start pitching saying
know square root negative dont
exist pretend like run
forward like could could
teach whole topic completely
differently start
talking process cycle
trying model process cycle
using normal number system
um anything cyclic
kind behavior uh there natural
number system try describe
call number system want
oh think like
clock think clock
number right anytime youre
clock stuff number theyre going
great use clock
number relevant
quantum mechanic got bunch
wave right there thing
cycling um there frequency
relevant youve got like e hf
type stuff there frequency
suspect complex number
useful electrical
engineering cuz youre dealing
bunch wave youve got
bunch cyclical process
frequency natural
model kind number
engineer adopted complex
plane complex number
fact right didnt say gee
need way let invent
said dont know
mathematician come
here way mean im
course im exaggerating mean
want know complex number
came originally um cuz think
sort lie tell
school say know there
thing square root
negative like pretend like
like mathematician love
pretending thing actually cut
something talking earlier
people solving cubic
equation wrote cubic
formula thank god neither u
memorize dont thank god
im picky thank god
thank math thank education
system uh like would ask
someone hey solve equation x2
1 0 um would said
solution like obviously there
going make solution
wont anything
certain cubic equation
tried use formula real
number answer real number real
number never whiff like
square root negative
use formula find real
valued answer take seriously
idea somewhere inside formula
there square root negative
cancel point
like youre working youre
engaging square root
negative
mathematician theyre like oh
one weird trick like kind work
dont know mean seems
work solving cubics um
think one reason
called imaginary took
long time people take
seriously thought
notational trick like word
imaginary kind derogatory
wasnt like hey want teach kid
call
like imaginary girlfriend
took much longer people
realize theyre useful
idea like cyclic
property make really useful
kind math invol
physic involves wave cycle
thats stuck
hello dr tyson lord nice mr brown
brandon new jersey
relation uh
conformal geomet geometry
pythagorean theorem recently ive
learned circle inversion
seems inversion
leveraging pythagorean theorem
maintain symmetry point
across line curving
work conformal geometry well
im completely confused wow
get wow
look man let answer
brandon second right stop
showing man
stop showing place
right go ahead
lecture hall would time
im like brandon let talk
class going
blackboard lesson better
everyone dont engage
want engage right
wanted try describing
conformal geometry circle
inversion right
20 second challenge
understand care
something go look
even fun go ahead
right go look
mirror see reflection
like different version
sometimes use
solve problem like solving hair
uh thing like
mathematics there different kind
mirror sometimes use
pretend like circle mirror
reflects everything
inside outside outside
inside special
transformation space there
certain geometry problem
look hard reflect
circle like
really weird mind warping motion
turn hard problem easy
problem thats called circle inversion
aspect cant
describe conformal geometry thats
circle inversion thats vibe
wont describe specific
problem youre curious
vibe treating circle
mirror cool
fascinating mean dont
get circle inversion
youre talking dont know
used dont understand
yeah yeah got give actual
example carry teeth
know little long
still showing though yeah he
showing without doubt brandon
showing okay guess im
glad im im glad know never
even heard conformal geometry
moment im happy
brandon showing
fodder lookup great
ethan steppp ethan say hello dr
tyson mr grant lord nice
youre
hello love people man
freaking love people say
name ethan north carolina
love math sometimes wonder
thing get figured
question earth someone
come tensor product okay
think easiest way describe
doesnt quite capture
like vector list
number might write like
column number matrix youve
got twodimensional grid number
used computer science time
machine learning work
sometimes want threedimensional
grid number way hold
data uh imagine like
threedimensional grid cell
grid number might call
tensor thats like computer
scientist way answer tensor
um physic use
certain object
represented tensor like um
relevant general relativity
describing curvature space um
there also corner math
uh object could
described like could give
coordinate system want
like threedimensional grid number
like answer question
like come
would come think usually
there specific
problem youre dealing
realize data represents
um something naturally
organizes like
threedimensional grid higher
dimensional grid number
natural way try even hold
idea head somebody got
clever enough see need
come right
everyone clever would
prisoner known math day
need someone step
say new way think
problem mean
physicist joke one
einstein greatest contribution
physic notation tensor
um like really nice
notation even write
let think
clearly blackboard
joke course cut
fact theyre central object
take clever mind even like
represent useful manipulable
way tig yeah
youre like
einstein summation notation
want um yeah yeah simplified
thing make make equation
look way simpler tame
whats actually going well im
going tell guy u made
look way simpler
idea youre talking okay
im
im going honest uh im
sitting rare
lost conversation one
like man
cool well plus he got 7
million follower youtube
he something right he
something right right yeah hi
grant hello dr tyson uh im akiya
im originally india live
san francisco heard last podcast
grant way
death valley dark sky festival
stargazing delightful
experience stopped along way
cafe lovely cup tea
jarging friend mary im
making part im like thanks
akiyah including
information trip
question grant uh
new revolutionary paradigm
mathematics like calculus algebra
uncovered today opposed
last millennium many fewer
people working mathematical
problem thank much
uh popularizing science
sound like disc wheres next
branch math right whats
guy done nothing
mean there definitely ton
development math new field
developed um even like new
math exists
okay algebraic geometry there
interesting phenomenon thats
happening last century
even latter half
someone tried think like grand
unified theory math something
youre trying understand
weird connection come
seemingly disperate part um
uh one one field tends
take perspective kind stepping
back saying hey
prime number like function
really living kind world
fact know one
tell u fact another um lot
people algebraic geometry
kind fit also
pretty big revolution way
people think math
thing thats called category
theory extremely hard
explain uh kind like
language sort like new
language mathematician think
work didnt exist 100
year ago much different
like way thinking
quietly happening among circle
way thats popularized
never going show high
school calculus class
absolutely like new thing okay
youre saying exists within
math none shown
k through2 textbook
like dont think shove
category theory k through2
textbook got say grant
right uh he throwing
shade mathematician back
akia talking he
like stuff complex right
yeah cant even learn
okay
okay three people learn
whole world thats baby
know youre joking know youre
joking hate kind
thing come across like oh
comp like
certain people certain job like
research mathematician trying find
proof tool job
great tool job
like maybe writing program
using mathematical modeling like
simulation youre running
good tool job
job writing proof like here
new tool coming invention
want pursue job hey
make approachable
want dont think everyone
job like shouldnt
shouldnt put k12 there
ton stuff thats complex
describe thats vocational right
want understand like exact
way injection molding work
something like might
something thats inappropriate
podcast like high
fallutin know super math brain
hey thing
peculiar one job tend involve
lot assumed jargon lot
assumed context people learning
meant akea
guess
necessary need know
basis dont need know basis
go right gina
say hello smarty pant uh
okay love say gina
martin say recently learning
circle pi learned
circumference circle never
whole rational number
hard time wrapping head around
pun intended wrapping head
around okay uh could please
explain little better
thanks gina north carolina
wait wait wait wait correct
cant cant diameter
irrational number end
circumference rational yeah
clear want circum
circumference could anything
want could number five um
think think intention
phrasing ratio
circumference diameter could
never like diameter
whole number circumference
never rational however want
phrase relationship
two thats fundamentally
irrational like like game
whackaole make one
nice number one look ugly
make one one nice
first one becomes ugly ugly becomes
irrational becomes hard write
um deep question
try say pi ratio
circle circumference diameter
irrational number
podcastable answer
give might satisfying
instead talking um circle
let talk square
square got side length
one ask far get
one side length one uh corner
opposite corner um end
square root two
something follows
pythagorean theorem another
situation geometric length
irrational relationship
first length drew ratio
diagonal square
side length square root two
irrational also much
much easier prove must
irrational uh
indulge think possible
like 45 second
see go right
ready go proof square
root two irrational assume
could write rational
number right like maybe think oh
maybeltunkgt 2 going dont
know like 5 3 maybe something
complicated like 153 311 like surely
find big enough number thatll make
work say whatever choose
well write p q say
thats thing theltunkgt 2
would mean um first
let assume fully reduced
wrote something like um 4
two could reduce 2 1
there common factor
reduce thing
true p q square
root two definition youre
saying p 2 q 2 equal 2
thats would mean
definition mean um
like multiply everything
bottom q 2 p 2 going equal
2 q 2 could come
number true
must admit p 2
2 q 2 mean p even
number two time something
p must even number
um yeah youre like okay
dont know let let call p uh
know 2 k something right um
even number write
algebraically replace
2 k youre going conclude
q also even number
take key equation
p 2 2 q 2 end looking like
4 k2 2 q 2 divide
stuff say hey q also
even number must conclude
p even must conclude q
even assumed start
reduced fraction
number couldnt even otherwise
wouldnt reduced
cannot way write
fraction otherwise end
infinite regress somehow
even
reduce
even youll youll never get
coherent answer little
weird get irrational number
take ratio two
number thats weird
fact great common
mathematician tool say oh want
prove somethings impossible
right suspect theyre like man
problem really hard think
might impossible like
big ego want say
hey cant solve
im dumb one
solve want prove
impossible classic tactic
say im going start
assuming possible like writing
notation say possible
would follow
come kind contradiction um
say see assumed
possible land thing
could never therefore assumption
false thats thats
common mathematician thing love
love starting
square thats cool hey star
talk fan dont know know
audio version
podcast actually post week advance
video version get
spotify apple podcast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk im tien
vietnam uh journey flat
land shape would use mean
would choose activity
would like thank
longtime fan star talk
tell u flatland happen
copy right desk oh
oh really thats great yeah ive got
one shelf
classic book um
author imagine world
thats twodimensional
three dimension look left
right said
twodimensional world thats
world bunch
creature making
analogy say like wouldnt
really hard describe
threedimensional shape like
someone life
flatland want describe
cube sphere like donut
shape really
cant describe
purpose book say
hey there geometric shape four
dimension hard
describe u u
describe flatlanders
question shape would
flatland
um cir mean kind basic maybe
circle seems useful roll
around um everythings nice
symmetric uh circle
inversion uh know
patron boy certainly going
appreciate um uh thats probably
got remember story
side
aristocratic oh look
right triangle would like
lowest scum earth
triangle cant believe
trying move know
better square
pentagon hexagon think id
hexagon okay id hexagon
want tessillate plane yes
want look yeah although
shape tessillate right
well shape mean got
square got triangle
mean look
look echer painting isnt
tessillation two
yeah yeah yeah two shape intersect
right difference im
call regular polygon
side equal
hexagon think
tessillation shape
called tessellation isnt
right well shape
tessillate youre right
pressure show youve got infinite
family tessellate agree
yes like angel devil
tessillating yeah yeah yeah yeah
test thats called
tessellation isnt mhm yeah 100
right right youre
going restrict
shape polygon right whats
called regular polygon
limited right want
hexagon tile floor
hexagon yes yeah
get people tile
snuggle everything fit fit
snugly together snuggly
cool shape would
talking tiling
whole tile discovered
couple year ago thats single tile
tessillates nonperiodic way
cant tessillate periodic
tesses nonperiodically
heard
regular polygon
shape wild
weird shape uh look
look like hat kind people call
um whats cool discovered
amateur um people
didnt know
shape um tile thing
nonperiodically uh tile thing
periodically without
periodic tiling like technical
question like
interesting tiling question amateur
found became little fun
celebrity math internet
couple month back whats
difference periodic
nonperiodic pattern great
pattern think
periodic like kind mean
pattern almost yeah like
shift whole picture look
identical take hexagon
tiling like shift view
one hexagon look identical
thats would mean
periodic um wasnt even known
could nonperiodic tiling uh
penrose
famous physic reason uh found
way use two tile
look like rhombus pattern
fill space never
repeat
describable pattern um describe
never repeat
shift viewing point
never look identical there
way shift
yeah kind like
digit pi irrational
number dont repeat
go
predictable way repeat
geometric equivalent
okay cool william
walker william walker say hello
gentleman florida florida
panhandle ive heard said
mathematically know property
im sure dimension higher
observe could please elaborate upon
say
dimension yeah get
mhm great great great great think
one big misconception
mathematician talk higher
dimension people like assume
talking something
physically realized
ultimately youre math
sometimes might something
described multiple number
system like dont know
little particle moving around
describe like velocity
list number position
list number often find
useful take number
list together
list three number could think
point threedimensional
space list two
number could think
point twodimensional space
uniquely math uniquely yeah
mathematician physicist um
realize like hey sometimes
solving problem list
like four number five number
really useful able like
visualize going
list three number
unique association triplet
number point 3d space
theyre like cant
cant say there abstract
fourdimensional space like
physical reality thats going
represent whatever problem im
solving there quadruplet
number come machine
learning day right
large language model read
text first thing
turn given word really big
list number like ten thousand
number common
researcher think point
insanely highdimensional space
use geometric idea describe
whats happening
model course saying
there like 12000dimensional space
physical reality
nice way describe um list
number shelf
dimension placeholder
got shelf klein
bottle bottle opener love
attempt represent
fourdimensional object three
dimension yeah yeah client
bottle something um
theyre comfortable four
dimension want
live try make live
three dimension like
unnaturally cross
there way put three
dimension without crossing
quin bottle bottle
inside yeah yeah think
thats fair way say there
cant distinguish inside
outside yeah friend
college got trouble
trespassing certain building
um theyre like maybe part
defense go fence outside
building apply one twist
whole fence moia
strip another one
shape there clear notion
inside outside like
argue authority
couldnt inside
trespassing area there
coherent notion inside
relevant area bored stanford
student yeah dont know
bored
creative stanford student yeah
creative enough go jail
youre still going
thats clever youd flip
fence reattach reattach
yeah yeah exactly middle
night know youre
whatever youre trespassing
make sure leave
like cut fence twist
fence reattach
moius fence defense
solid climb bottle
fourdimensional version mobius
strip kind yeah dont dont
love description mean
try take mobius strip
take another mobius strip
try glue edge together youll
get klein bottle mind
warping thing try think um
analogous mobia strip
nonorientable meaning
notion clear inside
outside theyre different
like klein bottle closed shape
doesnt edge mobius strip
edge like topologically theyre
pretty different animal
like swim water well
doesnt 1d edge
2d edge would
surface surface edge four
dimension isnt way
1d edge mobius strip
edge three dimension
live earth right try
walk find edge earth
sphere edge youre never
going like go edge
water falling right
flat disc would
could walk edge
youre little antobia strip
walk edge like peer
edge point youre walking
around klein bottle never hit
edge way uh like
mathematically call closed
surface way theyre
surface theyre 2d okay
there important distinction closed
surface thats key time
one question okay right
let go old friend kevin
samo oh okay kevin say thats
last name samo okay
middle name last name
samo say hey neil
touched threebody problem
explainer episode would
another branch mathematics
hasnt discovered yet could
solve like newton
motion honor sir isaac newton
spanish wine called principa
mathematica bright white
wine made charello im going
find wine yeah principia
greatest work uh
mathematical principle natural
philosophy uhhuh sensibly abbreviated
principia principia yeah
principia mathematica want
give full thing okay
greatest work there wine
name im going find thank
wine name
samo like question
point say
unsolvable point say
person who brilliant enough
solve yet born apply
genius
yeah would say there two different
way think problem hard
answer um case newton
modeling planet wasnt even
known right like math put
mathematic model
would use try make prediction
big contribution invent
appropriate field math could
use make prediction branch
mathematics youre inventing
today thought id rub
okay right um mean
threebody problem feel different
like dont
know math describe
instead saying know
intrinsically mathematical question
say given piece math thats
describing exactly newtonian
calculus
um known uh cannot predict
whats going happen
little bit error initial
prediction big um
surprise chaos theory initially
might think hey know
solve equation
equation im sufficiently smart
um know initial
state see world
evolves according equation
predict future chaos theory
said situation
including threebody problem
even exactly know
solution little bit
error measurement error
blow quickly subject
error possible state could end
like pretty short
amount time um span wide space
possibility effectively
outcome unpredictable unless
uh infinite precision
thats science engineering
work planet move right
result telling
unknown like answer
known answer
unknowable certain way right
known itll chaotic sense
final outcome sensitive
thats type problem
lending issue right
yeah need smarter person
come along idea
answer unknowable
actual solution thats
answer thats answer
cant solve solve
solution excellent
unknown agree thats
thats brilliant thats great
summary think thats great summary
chaos ive ive ive earned keep
go home barely know
time really chuck
last question
one thing like
mathematics get peer
doorway advance actually stepping
math model
reality speaking
scientist allows explore
world without ever leaving chair
math proper model
physical universe
power god hand
making prediction come
true give much
confidence math
universe
one power thrive
thinking higher dimension
topic talked
thing look like four dimension
five dimension six dimension
cant picture head
brain evolved plain
serengeti trying get eaten
lion dont capacity
think way mind
power calculate way give
u information know
higher dimension place
yet
visit cosmic
perspective tell u
youtube channel yeah youtubes
channel um named three blue one
brown admittedly weird name
could also search 3b1b um lot
topic weve discussed
flavor show channel
excellent else
find social medium three blue
brown whatever favorite um
social app day um okay
three one
numeral blue brown
word yeah correct hard
describe numeral mixed
number yeah 3b1b
search usually land
okay well congratulation
success say
god work yeah cuz cant divide
zero hope see
keep work need math
fluency world yes god
please infect whole country
please best right
chuck always good man
always pleasure right
star talk cosmic aquarius
mathematics edition neil degrasse
tyson keep looking
music
