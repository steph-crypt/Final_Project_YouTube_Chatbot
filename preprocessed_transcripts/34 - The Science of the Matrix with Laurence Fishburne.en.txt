h pas thats whats right
youve got scene
describing neoh mh
there chair constru
construct construct
right white everywhere right
brilliantly done there echo
perfectly done right
describe
machine using human
battery battery power
source power source there
language
scenario here problem
law
thermodynamics certain
amount energy turn
another kind energy
example there chemical energy
gasoline right put car
turn kinetic energy move
car mh ingest food
chemical energy keep body
body temperature temp even though
colder outside youre
comfortable 72° body still
maintaining
98° put anything outside
98 degree itll go 72
degree even though youre saying thats
really comfortable body
actively maintaining body
take energy right body moving
youre running youre acting take
energy right okay turn anytime
convert energy one form
another dont get 100
dont get 100 get like oh
best 90 uhhuh car forgot
number efficiency grown
year car might get 30 okay
energy gas move
forward got got know
rest go
heat thats engine get hot got
combustion engine car okay
take granted course
going get hot wait minute thats
energy wanted use go forward
right thats mile per gallon wasted
heat thats happens
convert one form energy another
another form en okay
law thermodynamics
dictate 100 dont get
100 energy right
machine using human form
energy say much energy
radiate okay depending big
right youre exercising
moment typically 80
100 watt okay okay okay 80 100 watt
light bulb thats much thats
used battery thats
fine rather bulb yeah idea
yeah idea thats matter
right okay energy source
machine theyre tapping 100
watt okay fine get 100
watt
theyre feeding u theyre feeding
u theyre feeding u right whatever
theyre feeding u feed
oh wow bypass middle
literal middleman middleman
dont need middle man right
okay dont feed human
generate energy
energy generate machine well
didnt study
physic probably
wouldnt movie wouldnt
great
movie sm people
like movie watch
never get two hour back
dont memory
dont appreciation
cultural know significance
worthy hall pas gladly signed
really gladly signed
idea human being battery
kind cool cool
true idea true speaking
hall pass principal
day middle school bronx oh
goodness program
bring youd see
public school run thing yeah

brilliantly delivered scene
battery dont say duracell
know copper top
exactly uh well done
one character refers
copper top movie yes yeah
derogatorily yeah yeah yeah yeah
film raised point early
early way know
someone generally credited
advancing poss idea
could living matrix name
nick bostrom okay
dumpster diving guest
earlier episode star talk he
oxford philosopher right
hypothesize ability
create world computer
character world think
free know youre
one character right
created right free
invent computer
want game time might create
computer world within computer
right think
free could
thing way exactly
close eye throw
dart im simplifying argument
essence close eye
throw dart universe
likely hit one
simulated universe one real one
started thats
terrifying prospect thats frightening
question frightening question
matrix sits middle yeah
middle best rebuttal
right way last universe
evolve get computer
program right right currently
ability computing
power create perfect world
people think free
dont ability yet dont
well dont ability yet
one middle
ability nope
either last one last simulated
universe hasnt gotten yet
original universe hasnt
gotten yet logic tell
yeah go odds like
99999 chance one two
okay thats got one
thats pretty good feel feel little
better thats clever
talking like
phone virtual life people
living online oh thats like
oh thats like think
become avatar yeah people
mean people living virtual
life phone
computer create avatar
post look
feel like life
live device
important life
real world remind
chris rock said anytime meet
someone really
representative person want
think
online better anything
yes allows sort present
present wish people think
way want people
perceive first step
one day step character
become online character
dont know here think though
happen let say youre
dying say upload
consciousness occupy
space established online
exactly science thing
thing called year million seen
thing right year million
yeah limited series
four episode
singularity youve heard
singularity hypothesis
singularity thats going
happen becomes sentient
ultimately happen
evolve point
integrate technology okay
thing described
able upload consciousness
matrix kind
thatll happen way sooner year
million well according show
science behind show didnt
wasnt responsible science im
narrator singularity
event close think
far think either
okay right thats right thats
thats im say 150 year ago
horse buggy yes
