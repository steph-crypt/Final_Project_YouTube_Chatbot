there pretty strictly good
application ai drive
really think apply ai
actually completely solve disease
biochemist last 50 year
theyve working protein
structure hand weve taken
data trained neural
network go input
molecule description try
predict data thats
begin thats
terminator start always
innocent dreamer say
change world good
music
star talk special edition neil
degrasse tyson personal
astrophysicist special edition mean
weve got gary oreilly house
gary hi neil former soccer pro
apparently yeah soccer announcer
yes definitely still
dont chuck nice baby hey
announcing know nothing
soccer youre club
announcing american
american dog real football
violence
talking ai today thats
favorite topic revisit
often future
entire world
ai matter biology oh wow
thats big deal know uhhuh
know yeah cuz people thinking
know composing term paper
winning chess got
whole frontier ready explored
tell producer
cooked today okay weve
case get guy involved
time busy
go ill say im made
protein yes youre made protein
string amino acid fold
shape put together form
u there fundamental problem
biology mhm implication
medicine protein
fold oh solution
looked ai google deep mind tool
called alphafold
second iteration alphafold 2
nobel prize chemistry last year
answering question
knew ai smart huh um ai win
nobel prize right yeah
give pack
pack isomorphic lab
together google deepmind developed
released alphafold 3 yes
third iteration last
year applied new ai model
drug discovery oh thats great
right think could
next generation treatment
computergenerated
oh yeah oh way neil let
introduce guest weve
got max yaderberg pronounce
correctly yeah got got
right let hear say yeah
let hear say say yeah
max yoderberg thats exactly
said
copied practicing
practicing studied ai oxford
thats right thats right hear
thats thats community college
oxford oxford community college thats
exactly right oxford england yes
specialized deep learning
algorithm got little bio
understanding image nice
big advance search go
image thought know id
died gone computer heaven
started yeah yeah mean
know 1015 year ago
back ai cool right um
know talk ai
something scifi book
understanding image video like
big thing point time
couldnt actually searched
9000 image computer word
telescope found telescope written
chinese photo taken angle
one image visiting
china yeah like
phd took bbcs back
catalog ran algorithm
across created search engine
could pull footage
decade ago text
object thats seriously
tie
ai looking image
seeing image way
even seeing whole image
brain really
intuiting image see
ai like
holistic process holistic processing ai
actually see image
seeing pixel thats right
really oh
pixel pixel pixel
arrangement thats image
tie language thats
search search ai
know actual image
like big breakthrough back
phd deep
learning well right
imagine pix
image full pixel
actually code read text
tie language
text right unimaginably
hard code hand yes
instead
put theyre called neural
network look pixel
image give lot
lot example image
somewhere got text
tell neural network
text see neural network
lot lot training start
work internal algorithm
extract information
pixel piece together spit
actual text spit
object wow youre currently
chief ai officer isomorphic lab
biology place thats right
biology
background formal biology
okay want ai
thats right thats right
place called deep mind beforehand
google google deep mind exactly um
long time absolutely
love core ai technology called
deep learning thats ive
developing whole career far
deep mind working crazy
stuff know learning play chess
go beating top professional
game like starcraft know back
big deal
yeah world didnt
know ai trying
prove even thing right
right seems crazy back
proving
actually real thing core
know love technology want
see profound impact
world thinking thing
begin yep thats
terminator start always
innocent dreamer
say change world
good closet
would like see exactly
always like evil
businessman who like
weather machine one day rule
world know apart apart
carry yes good thing there
pretty strictly good application
ai drive um know
demis yes started isomorphic lab
spinning google deep mind
really think apply ai
actually know completely solve
disease okay genetic link
back origin story deep
mind feel better
okay im happier yes moved
part founding team
head ai space um
know three half
year crazy journey
fascinating much fun
got ai expertise
alphafold spin biological
application first tell
word isomorphic mean
biology isomorphic
technical term know
onetoone mapping space right
reason called isomeorphic
lab really believe
biology really really complicated
world physic
write equation physic
math math perfect
description language physic
cant really write equation
math biology cell
complicated biology
complex expression chemistry
know oh thats there
many moving part make
yeah thats looking
rose stone
language biology exactly
could perfect description
language biology believe ai
machine learning
could exist isomorphism mapping
biological world
world ai machine learning hence
name hence name gotcha gotcha
gotcha right uh tell u
protein folding know
learn chemistry learn
chemical reaction really
taught shape molecule
anything
anything chemical
symbol write
chemical equation there
shape there
element molecule right comprise
equation dont really ever represent
threedimensional nature exactly
dont even know
handedness yes right take u
think protein protein
fundamental building block
life yeah theyre inside everyone
make everything
basically theyre made
whats called sequence amino acid
amino acid molecule mhm
there 20 different amino acid
put together long
life life
nonnatural amino acid well
make well
make make
actually use drug sometimes
string amino acid together
becomes protein
dont exist string fold
spontaneously cell right
create 3d shape thats
important protein
theyre basically molecular machine
dont exist
actually like create little
piece machinery interact
protein interact
biomolelecules like dna rna
right um interaction
shape fitting exactly exactly
proteact
3d jigsaw puzzle static
way harder 2d jigsaw
puzzle static thing
static puzzle piece
coming together change shape
something come contact
open something else
side protein change
machine go
thats going ask
speed folding taking place
continuous fold thats
youve told
keep moving whole thing
yeah really
really complex dynamical system
know composed know thousand
million trillion atom within
cell unfolding course
know micros secondsonds
beyond dynism youre
talking word
dinism thats word isnt
word dinism think made
oh dynism dynamism dynamism
thank im correcting grammar
first
dynamism dynamism kind dinosaur
dynamism dinosaur dinosaur dinosaur
dinosaur dynamism
youre talking within cell
look one u since
one u different even
though there general like execution
blueprint come
different part process
looking mapping
would say jellyfish look
identical true okay theyre
saying oh skin color slightly
different slightly taller yes
youre describing function
cellular level job
understand job figure
extra way fold protein
maybe biology yet even figure
solve problem
encounter natural universe
oh good question
youre happy today
happy happy
today yeah really
interesting little
molecular machine protein
care 3d structure
work two reason one want
understand know cell
work something go wrong
case
disease want understand
okay
actually need go start fixing
right stop
actually going wrong first place
exactly exactly thats one
thing think
okay go fix
actually saying
drug design saying create
another molecule come
cell actually start modulating
molecular machine going
drug molecule going actually
attach protein
thats going cause protein
change shape example wont
operate normally
stop protein working make
work better sort
thing kind reminds
messenger rna
vaccine develop co yeah
know there many different
type molecular mechanism
take advantage drug design wow
folding protein generally
following set pattern way
fold youre able map
misfold thats
youre able flag
reinvented something talked
rubbish would cool
youre youre youre something
great know like
mean amazing thing
actually turn predict
protein fold modeling
yeah modeling deep
learning neural network thats
alphafold know
generation um
mean actually take
sequence amino acid knowing
nothing protein
get 3d structure
normally would take people month
year work 3d
structure alphafold
know large molecule want
fold got know
way learned
hundred000 example
chemist biochemist last 50
year theyve working
protein structure hand theyve
literally synthesizing protein
crystallizing shooting xrays
like look electron
scattering resolve
protein structure
pretty hard process people
thats way
photograph shape
molecule thats way photograph
reality kind
basically electron microscope
level yeah similar like electron
scattering yeah exactly people
last 50
year depositing structure
weve taken data
trained neural network go
input molecule
description try predict
data right amazing thing
really remarkable
train last
50 year data thats couple
hundred thousand protein
biomolelecular system
apply seemingly everything know
protein universe
proteome proteeration
prediction ai
around little youve already
said youre ai tool
thats accurate
particular tool yes
alphold 2 right big jump
started get experimental
level accuracy protein
thats nobel prize
balance empirical
experiment benchmark
real lab work right alpha 2
reached level alphafold 3
expands protein
incorporate biomolelecular type
protein protein
protein dna rna whats
called small molecule
neighborhood start mixing
maybe neighborhood maybe
neighborhood get little bit
upgrade
thats thats make
superhuman
going terminator
going superhuman
theyre going like u
theyre going look u go
know need guy
thats anyway youre able
predict actually
taken modeled prediction
made protein yeah oh yeah
tell u expect lead
new innovative drug cuz
otherwise puzzle
exercise yeah great lego set
lego set
want guest enjoy yeah
like oh god much
lego set cost 10 billion
laughter
sorry go ahead yeah yeah
take particular disease
know think
actually know solve disease
modulating particular protein mhm
question
design drug molecule want
fit protein certain way
oh traditionally
would actually either
guess go
crystallize one
combination photograph
see worked
model ai thousand
like minute isnt
call target target protein
yes wow know youve got
certain target protein
run list drug
think one drug work better
maybe drug whichever
letter alphabet youre
become sort detective
alpha fold 3 produced many
clue many answer
still grappling yeah instead trying
figure drug ai actually
figure drug drug
discovery well exactly know
let guy speak might hear
two okay figuring
whole industry gary
yes yeah know exactly
going right
start actually rationally designing
drug right traditionally
would take know million random
molecule would throw
protein see stick
thats many drug
created historically yeah
go back youre
sifting mud find sort
molecule there
low percentage success rate
sort drug whatever
problem thats part
know dont necessarily
understand molecule
working something like
alphaold 3 know put
molecule put target protein
system neural network
get 3d structure
chemist start understand
okay small molecule drug
modulating protein still
problem well find
small molecule first place thats
going good protein
know estimated there like 10
60 possible druglike molecule
thats know 10 60
zero even people know 10
16 yeah
dont rude
even perfect alpha fold
youd run across 10
60 molecule
computationally impossible
unfeasible right quantum computing
need something
call generative model
agent able actually search
space understand
entire entire molecular space come
molecule design oh
cuz 10 60
randomly exactly right right
throwing anyway right
right dont randomly
yeah randomly
stateoftheart method right
thats people people
currently thats people
currently well call
stateoftheart youre state
art well thank let let
use word properly
protein turn left
youve predict youve mapped
turn right issue
even alpha fold 3 problem
exactly uh perfect
model end day theyre
accurate make
mistake still currently
need go lab occasionally
amount lab work
much less right
often find area
molecular space model
work know really really well
go lab later
line crystallize thing
see yeah like perfect
mapping model predicted
right back earlier point
yeah old day like last month
pharmaceutical company
big pharma would spend million maybe
quite billion hundred
million dollar developing drug
think holding aside might
abuse pricing fact
there truth first pill
mhm cost 50 million second pill
cost 10 cent
research get formula
first pill narrow
search space cost
developing first pill
manifold smaller mean cost
average 3 billion create new drug
wow thats thats thats thats
average yeah yeah there
low said hundred
billion lowballing
lowballing okay um
massive opportunity like completely
change like cost speed
business model efficacy
business model
proprietary here real cuz
here would revolutionize
come im im company
right mine get
determine everything youre ai
company youre
okay sell
one make
price lower consumer goal
like really redefine
way drug design becomes
much cheaper much
abundance potential drug
chemical matter really
change business model change
economics space
actually revolutionize
cost making drug yeah
thats thats going thats
going right one
satisfied one next step
alpha fold whichever three maybe
next iteration going
investigate drive
misfolding protein
kind get ahead even story
happening wow actually
misfolding protein another thing
thats cause type
disease yeah youll
genetic mutation mutation dna
change particular amino
acid protein doesnt
fold normal way fold
doesnt function normally
molecular machine
thing like alphafold help u
understand mutation
cause misfolding theyre called
misssense mutation right
know could potential drug
target could know think
molecule could know mitigate
understand correctly
look pdr
thick whats pdr physician
desk reference thank uh
thick size old style
manhattan phone book okay
thick multiple inch across
chalk full existing medicine
available doctor prescribe
true 100 medicine
interacting patient chemically
rather protein folding
thats case
mean protein misfold
cant combat kind folding
algorithm prescribe
chemistry body handle
impact say
right think
majority drug
chemical take
know chemical going fix
fold going treat symptom
misfolding happen
changing
mutation protein
could something like gene therapy um
chemical
come attach
protein somehow mitigate
know something like misfold
itll change interface change
molecular machine work
thats particular disease
isomorphic lab focusing upon right
broad
spectrum let let let go
protein cherry pick certain
thing really looking one
particular technology creating
really really general want
able apply drug design engine
protein target disease
area come way saying
know practically company
want focus particular
area focusing moment
know lot cancer course lot
immunology course two biggies
two probably lend best
youre trying accomplish
actually okay question everyones
going want ask right thats
watching listening
getting
would mean going really well
honest um seeing
algorithm actually know change
way able drug
design able discover
know completely novel chemical matter
target
know people working
know even decade right
really really hard stuff making
amazing progress still still really
early company um super
exciting sent anything
photographed yet
sent thing
molecular photograph yeah okay yeah
yeah know youre allowed talk
know get
happy okay go
thats listen im im im
picking youre putting
thats cool yeah
see work fundamental research
publish result
publish image published
image dna molecule know
double helix becomes
public knowledge point
someone tool access alphafold
3 would company access
published blueprint
drug design often
blueprint come patent
youre youre going go
clinical trial need patent
molecule patent youll
lot data around molecule
formula work
talking earlier yeah yeah yeah
okay yeah right
immune system cancer mhm
leading cause malades
world genetic disorder
affect one 100000 people wow
bring together there
enough know theyll fill
stadium world thats
uncommon really trigger
anybodys interest yeah also
profitable dont
dont enough market
sell drug mean know
exactly point chuck um
traditionally might
attractive commercially go
know small patient population
world much
cheaper much easier get
drug molecule open like
space cheaper
easier justify going
risk risk list
big guiding star u like
thats
thats beautiful see
guiding star yeah know
would great though he picked
environment he sitting hows
chief ai officer yeah im interested
active company shaping
policy around youre
there going great deal
legislative policy going
tied youre
patent implication there going
know research implication
going lot thing tied
yeah yeah yeah mean weve
talking conversation
drug design youve
designed drug youve got go
patient clinical trial thats
really long process yeah
mouse even mouse
model theyre actually
predictive like
study mouse dont
know doesnt translate success
people right got go
evolutionary scale get
human bit yeah exactly
there know imagine
world design load new
drug weve got changing way
clinical trial
know actually get
drug patient really really need
timely manner um think
there lot done like
rethought rethought
ultimate goal alphafold think
medical science whole able
bespoke medication
individual rather broader
spectrum medication find
side effect
able design drug
medication zero side effect
work exactly
goal right
shooting know imagine world
sequence particular
cancer mutation right based
individual mutation
generating specific drug
right even like
know 3d printed something around
corner okay yeah um
yet right nent
stage right
imunotherapy cancer treatment
many yet cured
disease lend solution
involve protein folding
many plain old oldfashioned
chemistry protein make like pretty
much molecular machinery
there there class disease
due misfolding there
many many disease due
example protein
expressed properly know cell
going wrong certain tissue
bacterial infection give
antibacterial chemical im
done need
chemical interacting
protein bacteria okay
protein fundamental machinery
chemical drug
modulating protein whether
like cell bacteria
right basically everything
youre talking
happening cellular level
youre describing happening inside
cell protein thing
3d jigsaw puzzle solution
remedy get
remedy inside cell interact
folding delivery system
like trojan horse virus something
cuz virus get pretty uh
command yeah well think
drug take pill drug
design really hard
targeting protein
got get right place
might want pill take
take pill got absorbed
body got soluble
right got go gut
wall got go
bloodstream particular tissue
type cell type care
got go cell membrane
able actually target maybe
target within cell
need property single
molecule actually designing
molecule hit
protein also soluble
cell permeable there many
different factor dont
want molecule toxic
want hit target interest
hit anything else see
molecule get cell
wall yeah simple molecule
fullup protein redblooded protein
hows getting cell
wall exactly there different type
drug call small
molecule thing could take
pill others made protein
theyre often thing
would inject directly inside um
might cell
permeable would thing like
peptide often protein
based drug thing like antibody uh
theyre injected dont go
cell theyre interacting
protein surface cell
dont need permeability
really depends target
want people able
take drug sometimes pill
best thing actually sometimes
injecting best thing yes
remind peptide peptide
really small protein um
got fullblown protein
big molecular machine youve
got small protein um made
know five 50 amino acid
peptide peptide theyre
smaller sometimes
configuration get
cell wall
computer science
upending chemistry weve known
going find kind moving
even ai ai
sort moving science
going see stick one
particular area chemistry always
going exist like
like field science
moment science like chemistry
without math wouldnt think
going
thing ai already mind
wouldnt chemistry without
ai wouldnt biology without ai
fundamental tool
allows u understand world
better chemist one day
like coal miner like remember
grandpappa used go lab
going back issue coming
home smelling like chemical
who actually going able
access alpha fold 3 ai
iteration exclusively isomeorphic
lab come license
want home kit thats exactly
right right right dna go
there alpha fold going
come pill take dont
even need point would
cool finger prick
like put finger sensor
something figure
make pill home home
yeah yeah look thranos story
one
wow thats woman went
prison right access
alphafold search alphold
server um there whole webbased
system fold
protein know academic
use really cool
put system get 3d
fold alfold 3 download
yeah oh cool man mean far
away modeling entire
human suppose touch
onto fear modeling creating
either model mhm next
step creating yeah thats true
thats thats true
thats dream kind need
work scale
know model two atom
interact write
equation simulate small atomic
system thing like alpha fold
get bigger atomic system thing
scale like multiple protein
weve got accurate alpha
3 maybe actually bootstrap
get sort even bigger
system call pathway
thing interact
clicking within
look book table um
action potential interaction
atom molecule youd
good sense
molecule combine
exothermic endothermic
atom molecule powerful
convenient thats
first rung ascending
ladder complexity
gaining control yeah there
there trillion atom within
single cell let alone whole human
body right unfeasible
simulate whole thing
know
good measurement technique different
level scale measure
thing like protein folding
measure amount protein within
cell measure number cell
certain type within tissue
bigger
easier would measure
little window sort
microscopic world
use ai sort fill gap
bootstrap stuff well
atomic level start building
scale modeling make
read article like god know
long ago god long read
article know god
anyway talking
fertilized cell start uh proliferate
become person basically
determined scientist
determined point
many year ago way
could describe there
bunch noise like there
bunch noise cant really see
anything cant make sense
basically
look data would
noise able pierce
veil see mean
havent looking specific
thing okay start
understand know
really granular scale
integrate create sort
dont know coarser measurement
coarser prediction
lot area science
right dont simulate whole
universe atomic scale
find rule thumb way
describe sort broader collection
molecule thats start
build actually learn
neural network cool
question behalf chuck could
alpha discover hallucinogenic
could make see god
deity thank
asking welcome would like
real answer please
go alphael server
try okay right
invitation hey listen im
weve looked previous
show talking biome medical
engineering travel
world deep space probably
going need different upgrade
u able
going able alpha fold
ai like able upgrade
make sort deep
space travel upgrade
anything needi
know yeah sort
beyond know solving disease
like actually enhance
right dont know think like there
there probably potential right
think creating chemical matter
take ingest
mean aging alone would huge
application mean there
crazy research aging aging
basically cellular degeneration
youre able molecular
level kind restart process
jumpst start know boost
aging interesting one know
really nent area research
people starting work
um factor
reverse age cell
thing called yamanaka factor yes um
there even potential people
finding creating molecule
stabilize particular protein yamanaka
factor protein theyre
transcription factor read dna
stabilize thing maybe
revers age cell
super nent
connection wanting modify
genome ability fold protein
interact physiology asked
im reminded
scene film gatka
didnt manipulate genome
selected preexisting genome
certain property there person
giving piano recital
rich sound mean beautiful
camera came around
front person 12 finger
thats right
bread yes right get two
extra note every everything
right everything going could
play stuff like nobody could
play nobody could play nobody
could play would
modifying go space
necessarily sort enrich
diversity human specie
genetic modification
say he english must trust
honest yes thank thank
well done well well played
wait
thing particular type drug
know thing would
manipulate genome um thats
people know start target
disease class drug
working think
big ambition solving disease
maybe something need
um time want
really crack like whole spectrum
disease right even possible
consider without considering
whole area bleeds
together point yeah mean
need understand genome
effect changing
particular base pair dna
going change know protein
expressed abundance
knock effect
pathway really want like
basically virtual cell able
manipulate cell computer
right experiment here
want like cell template
talking prioritizing
im asking much already
happens animal kingdom know
long decade even century
imagined top
evolutionary yeah tri
without arrogance whatsoever yeah
right yet noot regenerate
limb cant yeah
seems theyre vertebrate
seems ought way
extract animal thing
could benefit make
priority people especially
veteran whove lost limb right
conflict uh even gecko
sticky hand like maybe um
could spiderman one day well
organiz prioritize truck
theyll become superheroes
regeneration limb thats
thats got protein thing going
isnt yeah mean
know mechanism
protein nuke well
mechanism dont
know okay yeah
would mechanism emulate
could could yeah
install physiology
big yeah lot yeah
would able look
drug already
drug well
tolerated able reconfigure
way get
benefit drug without side
effect yeah exactly often
first generation drug
something
side effect there big
opportunity understand better
drug work thing like alphab 3
thing like model understand
toxicity drug allow u
potentially modify become
better drug less side effect
less toxic effect cool well thats
going back medical catalog
reanalyze exactly
ai would perfect right
exactly yeah yeah guy going
make lot money man dont
know get seen dollar sign see
get huge company want
invest need get piece
company guy going make
mean cant even imagine amount
gob gob money money
cell body amazing
doorstep quantum
computing know impact
would field field
would make entire life work
look like done abacus
yeah mean mean
going change thing think open
question change machine
learning like ai
quantum computing chemistry even
nearterm real
application quantum computer
understanding property small
molecule drug actually
thing people today
quantum computer simulate simulate
small chemical system like
actually even even company
quantum simulation team um
know using quantum computer
simulating know quantum
effect molecule
quantum computer could work
scale could use instead wow
think many need frontier
chemistry modern society uh one
know
plastic thats
environment thats still
ocean life form
create thatll digest plastic
turn back original
molecule protein something
could applied
world youre describing
ability youre describing
specific solution problem youre
youre empowering chemist way
never previously imagined yes
use capability alphafold
understand know understanding
structural protein people using
outside drug drug design people
people using example
create bacteria enzyme
could potentially digest plastic like
youre talking could think
engineering um know
resilient type crop sort
thing yeah like ai
platform upon rest
technology field yeah thats
amazing thing protein
folding problem start solve
unlock many new thing
whole broad spectrum science right
there lot downstream benefit
would say
okay last thing here last thing
get piece
coming chuck got dollar sign
eye get piece
last thing la last thing
worst possible outcome work
oo question
guard rail necessary go
forward new technology
awesome power come awesome
responsibility yeah mean think
um know ai
know creating new
biology chemical know
need think
use responsibly like youre
putting world openly versus
um close know
many safety reason think there
there lot thing consider
yeah cuz famously one
jurassic park film withheld
lysine
amino acid one dinosaur
case escaped mhm would die
would need lysine
survival kind
insurance plan put life
always find way yeah go
anyway
maxwell yatterberg
yeah thank joining u star
talk going watching
company chuck want piece
yes dont know mean
anyhow im delighted
able look lens
birth entire frontier
human physiology mean time
thank much
super super fun talk thank
excellent excellent right think
done mhm uh
another installment star talk special
edition talking ai human
physiology future drug oh
yeah gary good always
pleasure neil right chuck always
pleasure always
star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist keep looking
music
