david latest
understanding dark matter problem
dont know make
universe okay thats done
famous monochromatic
tic tac everybody saw
stuff like
amazing thing dont fully understand
would government hide
government agency leak anyones
going get funding leak
definitely leak
thats answer right
music
star talk neil degrass
tyson personal astrophysicist chuck
nice right hey neil
right maam know
going today oh gosh yeah okay
got good one got good one got
good got good one remember
happened ufo got rebranded
government uaps yeah
unidentify
aerial phenomenon yeah yeah
inside guy operation
fact came attention
congress let introduce
friend colleague david spurgle
david pleasure welcome
star talk dude came together
graduate school intersected
thoroughly uh postto
princeton okay faculty
became chairman
knew scientist
he running everything right
exactly im looking look boy
running chaired nasa
uap unidentified aol independent study
team chaired thats
youre president simon
foundation well get
later chaired science definition
team nancy grace roman telescope
okay well
time youre also bo board
trustee carnegie institute uh
science carnegie isnt
group edwin hubble work
yep long legacy long uh
really impressive tradition david
morph mr head honcho
scientist big man campus alien ufo
guy congress approached way
approach scientific question okay
approach way thing dont
understand look data
mhm realize much
data could explained balloon drone
anything flashing light
airplane know alien coming
want hidden dont put
flashing light right
ufo exactly like undercover cop
dont like dont see undercover
cop marked police car sir
siren blazing light flash right
okay doesnt preclude
possibility craft would
flashing light fact mothership
close encounter third kind
ton flashing light nothing
flashing flashing light like
dog disco sky disco
yeah im sure flashing light
really make sense spaceship okay
anyway there bunch thing
look look
carefully theyre camera defect think
weve taken picture people
sun glint got ruined
picture correct something like
flare lens flar right
go think thats happening
million time day something
going interesting youre going
find jesus one one
lens flare right thats religion
look
thing dont
understand okay right there
event approximately fraction
percent 1 1 yeah right okay
1 event military
study went
used lot work 1
understood wait back
sec appointed committee uh nasa
nasa nasa nasa okay gotta
give advice nasa could
help advance understanding
requested congress uh
requested head nasa okay
nasa want play sandbox yep yes
okay mm nasa among
transparent agency absolutely
reason dont
agenda nothing study
classified clearance
mh talk openly
everything looked
event didnt understand
highest level
clearance thats would say
say dont clearance
dont c thats exactly
high clearance person would say go
um data ambiguous didnt
understand wasnt like
something clear one point
made scientist
1 dont know yeah
yes okay yeah dont
understand something dont jump
exciting conclusion right
dont say got alien
know look say something
dont know dont ignore
either right ignore
thing dont understand
thing dont understand
want get better
data really message
nasa wanted contribute
help get better data
right everyone carrying
back pocket device take really
high quality digital image yes
accurately record time yes measure
gps position correct measure local
magnetic field make measure local
gravity invitational field
thats
know youre orienting phone
clearly thats
android hey ive got iphone
think billion
around planet youre saying
know way north
using magnetic north
correct got correct
got correct okay know
earth corrects magnetic
anomal call
giv true north true north
good okay yep get really
amazing device measure
ph imagine
picture something didnt
understand taken citizen
whole bunch different perspective
canine different sight line youll
able reconstruct event okay
know fast object moving
far away susceptible
someone capacity interpret
see thats right single
blurry image ten high quality
image mh dont worry
thing like camera flare
youve got multiple im multiple
image recommendation nasa
develop app develop
app oh gosh okay whats
app doesnt exist yet
recommendation fund
development something like
uh use collect
data id app
phone see something dont understand
take picture metadata
image upload app
app simple way
want simplified much possible
go central place
people
coate correlate data
said try make everything public
youre crowdsourcing data
gathering yep okay people
everywhere people everywhere
felt teachable moment
chance say
scientist collect data verify
data check data quality bunch
tv interview soon
started talking checking data
quality ended interview
wanted hear yeah yeah dont
boring dude like want
make sure people didnt put fake
image love he like
course uh gather data check data
quality like guy
integrity get hell
youre saying
era photoshop
even advan even ai
generating image want make sure
need way authenticate yeah
camera caught didnt
even occur see im im
thinking yeah take picture
fact photoshop type
program exist phone
dont actually go right like
could hit button phone
start manipulating image right
go take import
computer mess put
back right
take picture make
sense mean hard take
picture shaking hand friend
replace picture friend
dont know dr spock whoever
favorite alien would
mine spock half alien think thats
true half mother uh show
accurate mom
human dad im saying thats
im saying presented result
year ago happened
since know nasa considering
developing thing need
new money oh yeah okay little partt
money last year tough
year nasa budget right nasa
took huge budget cut remember
yeah cancel program yes
start something new
uhhuh mean started
thought thered new monies
congress theyd able say here
program would would go
community thought
like here something nasa could
would involve citizen yeah
time
cancelling mission
want anything thats really
shame least
radar something money
becomes available okay way
dont think thats big mistake
here im picking
youre saying
immediately uh enlisting public
getting people focus nasa youre
getting excited one thing
every everybody agree
exciting
visited youre saying okay here
app get involved like would would
take money someplace else put
yeah also said
think true see
convincing evidence existence
alien okay see there problem
didnt
lie know seeing convincing
evidence doesnt mean doesnt exist
mean there convincing
evidence absolutely know well
friend fellow
astrophysicist strong
overlap training brain
wiring dont want everyone
committee exactly
brain wiring else
committee nature
expertise selected
selected nasa involved
advising committee chair
pretty diverse set
people coming
oceanography atmospheric science
there lot atmospheric phenomenon
expert ionosphere
science policy people ionosphere
layer upper
atmosphere ied yeah yeah thats
get northern light
happen iere well may even
higher doesnt start
go go ion spere
usually right lot
northern light usually bit lower
know connected phenomenon
okay mh certain radio
frequency radio w reflect
ionosphere interesting thing
happen ionosphere wouldnt
happen layer oh yeah
pretty wild okay go
people intelligence community
mhm right lot
satellite looking okay
would clearance even
didnt thats right yes okay
business business
people um technology
company good right familiar
uh technology
thing use
space look see
going onh al thought
went encouraging lot
different perspective around table
actually really good group
people learned lot
weve learned day avid team
one exciting thing
scientific discovery even
dont find answer
process bring u closer truth
take recent trappist one study
example scientist completed longest
search sign alien technology
although didnt find
effort established new method
future search open new idea
always refining research
important lesson something
longtime partner ground news really
help theyre small team led
former nasa engineer dedicated adding
clarity often contradictory medium
landscape calculating credible
every source reporting story
actually high
gold standard responsible journalism
way low
easily distinguish fact fiction
want dive even deeper ground
news daily briefing break
day top story clearly
highlighting fact point agreement
even opposing view exposing
diverse viewpoint ensures
youre critically informed
enough think youre right even
challenge assumption grow
youre curious u
subscribe ground news today give
someone know giving
viewer 50 unlimited
access vantage plan biggest
discount year go ground
news startalk scan qr code
really cant recommend enough
let get back show right
role hearing
watch rest
hearing watch
everything yeah thought
reflection amazing
thing came fun
watch dont know remember
body alien sh
mexican mexican parliament
meican mummy nasa mummy
mexico put display theyre like 3
foot tall right there like two
three yeah yeah
like came
came yeah
um one thing look
say wait second actually
something think
interesting
send sample around mhm right like
know send sample 100 lab
around world human
dna well find quickly without
bias might inherent
produced body right
addition saw said thats
exactly
crashed alien body put
display one
testimony everyone kept saying
claimed existed said
lock box cant come
look thought alien
lock box youre showing
anybody thing alien
youre scientifically thing
ask something old
mean yeah would
impetus showing fact
alien exist would
government hide know
conspiracy theorist
know ill ill turn
around go ahead ive worked
government agency long time
government agency
leak anyones going get
funding leak definitely
leak im running thats answer
right like running lab
secret alien stuff
leak there lot information
alien body shown get
funding course one
reason dont believe
conspiracy theorist trust people
look economic
selfinterest know
government leak everything time
favorite quote ben franklin
poor richard almanac yes said
three people keep secret two
dead foundational
document country thats right
um didnt bring forward
maybe dont exist oh okay
right yeah okay big concern
could kind alien
technology far beyond u
could pose security risk youre
saying even 1 thing
could explain nothing
whoa could uh future
technology cuz think anything
today thats flying air
would look like anybody 100 year ago
doesnt take much time delta
possibly freak someone right
advanced thats part
story area 51 right
military developing
advanced technology
secret cold war cold war
think drone imagine saw
drone
25 30 year ago right never seen one
right moving moving
direction went
along axis axis instantly
instantly yes would think dr
human control right would
think drone totally used
alien spaceship mhm right
know there technology
look lot reported
event number
event associated thing
seen military pilot
ask going trying
see military pilot
fly way
planet study plane
deployed outside
taiwan chinese one
thing came
study may remember chinese balloon
yes right love chinese balloon
yeah right
clear united state shoot
shot shot
united state spying
chinese military chinese spying
u military like
job right part security
value monitoring getting
information remember correctly
back 60 government
dis sow ufo sighting
wanted promote people awareness
case saw something
russia sending get
firsthand knowledge people
everywhere military isnt
strategic value
far military concerned would
still case know look
war ukraine yeah
ukrainian russian
relying citizen uh following
drone theyve got apps phone
thats right see drone fly
know shoot
yeah
still hearing
week ago year
hearing thought everything got
aired much needed
know think people like
conspiracy people want believe mhm
yeah um people
comfortable ambiguity right say
know look lot data
there thing dont understand
theyd rather jump exciting
conclusion justor make feel
better though know every science
hit something dont understand
excites u right dont immediately
come explanation might
hypothesis without
justifying data better
data mean let honest people
scientist people see
splotch piece toast theyre
like jesus let honest ive
seen pretty good jesus rendering
though good one there
good one renaissance
jesus though well always always thats
painted probably yeah
know jesus
painting look like he local
town there lot lot blonde
jesus right yeah thats funny yeah
never get afro jesus afro jesus
doesnt piece toast pull
toast toaster oven couldnt
believe afro jesus since jew jesus
jewish itd jewish afro
would right thats would
happened definitely
field science general
greatly devalue eyewitness
testimony another way
obtaining data ufo kind
eyewitness testimony
come upon youre already
measuring equipment apart
smartphone else
someone offer
eyewitness testimony theyve
experienced know eyewitness
testimony reliable
mean something weve
learned talking black man
saying yeah there lot
mean isnt alien right
lot court case people
unjustly convicted positively
identified positively identified
eyewitness eyewitness
even without malicious intent
sometimes malicious time
people going thats thats
shown something
shown picture light actually
right right three block away
know there lot problem
eyewitness testimony think
actually important
understanding thing context
justice system mm
ufo right course right
camera dont
camera um early warning radar
system mean step back
think data military
data scientific
community monitoring space
environment around u
time add think
ran number there
million people given moment
airborne window right sitting
next next thats right
mothership coming totally
crowdsource also monitor
everything coming solar system
right something big
coming solar system guy
power knew wed see
yes well certain military
certainly monitor everything flying
u right cannot fly plane
know europe u without
uh someone noticing mhm right right
monitoring lot around u
know lot
environment go
data know lot people
done isnt
convincing
evidence advanced technology beyond
famous
monochromatic tic tac everybody saw
f18 navy pilot reported
hear oh gosh
orbit
moving right dont know
distance object mhm um
dont
tool get distan need new
airplane cant know im sorry
well dont know data
quality event
terrific youd like
measurement know said
there per know there percent
dont understand
like absolutely part right
one thats one cerce
thats one centerpiece one
look say thats
strange next thing think let
get data far away
fast moving right right could
explained conventional
technology balloon far away
something normative could
dont know need better data
pretty um heard someone
security space
suggest would wouldnt
restricted airspace ideal place
military put
anomalous object sensor
see pilot react mhm
scrimmage test scrimmage oh yes
yes see try
shoot puzzled
happen dont
want tell anybody thats
happened part
reaction part theyre looking
find happened right yeah
whole thing stress test
youre trying figure okay
going respond create
circumstance measure
response something yeah
one thing keep mind
actually military commercial
pilot job investigate
funny thing window right
youre united pilot flying new
york chicago see something weird
window go announce
people plane
going hour late going
chicago im going circle around
look weird object
side last day
p youre military pilot
timed constantly right fast
get point point b
trained sensor set
way collect data
star trek right like boldly go
seek new life new life
new civilization yeah cuz every minute
youre there million
dollar cost million dollar
keep air military
job protect country right
job study unidentified
scientific phenomenon right thats
thats nasa job tell new
phenomenon identified
crowdsourced crowdsourced
observation phenomenon sky
one really interesting phenoma
sprite tell lightning
sprite something thats new
flavor yeah basically
upwardgoing lightning 10 time
common regular lightning
pilot would report seeing stuff
fast people
dismissed turn
really common phenomenon go
image google type lightning sprite
sp r r like old softare like
okay youll see amazing image
image dismissed developed
technology get fast enough
get lot image
sprite wow oh theyre
transitory theyre really fast
hard oh get
camera gone gone okay
crowdsourcing encouraging people
document see whatever way
whether discover alien
might discover new science mean
there amazing thing
like st elmos fire thats movie
thats movie good movie
nostalgic know show age
like um well wait sam no fire
discharge top ship
mast glow every say oh
thats beautiful dude youre
get hit lightning
lightning say goodbye saye yeah
explain ball lightning please ive
heard ive never even seen like
picture ball
ionized plasma like gas thats
hot there free electron moving
around okay persists like
one scary thing ive heard
like youre incident
airplane ball
lightning rolled aisle
plane left howd get
plane came window side
dont know plane closed
travel
agent wanted first class wait wait
understand something plane
made metal going move
ionized material metal
actually dont know got mean
there report
something eyewitness work
work plan
level almost faraday cage yeah
right people reproduced
phenomenon might tangled magnet
piece magnetic field plasma
dont quite ball lightning im
expert understanding
still well understood okay okay
there know stuff
like
amazing thing dont fully understand
im going paraphrase hume think
subject miracle
likelihood
could new law physic youre
witnessing greater fact
actually miracle
transcends physic transcends
law physic right
case going see phenomenon
completely weird
never way capture
likely natural phenomenon
thats new u visiting space
alien eavesdropping think
scientist guided
wonderful quote galileo measure
whats
measurable figure make
measurable cant measure oh oh
wow look thats great thats
great okay thats best quote
though okay want got one better
yeah go ahead bible tell
go heaven heaven go oh
wrap let tell
something thats thats mic drop right
thats
yeah thats good one right
david got smartphone
ideal device imagine
deploying people would get
better data cell phone
think would really start cell
phone cu dont know
phenomenon right dont invent
new expensive technology
everyones carrying cell phone around
pocket astrophysics
invent new kind telescope
time new detector
even dont know detector
going find deny something
similar public cuz
going put hand
everybody think carry 100
inch telescope
back yeah know one big concern
right issue
scientific trust interesting right
people dont trust scientist think
thing hidden right feel
important also address question
like sense conspiracy
sense somethings hidden
involving public acquiring data
looking data understanding
transparent thing want
transparent want open espe
there sense hidden
conspiracy think thats great okay
bad segue mh thing
hidden u want
reveal one longest unsolved
problem astrophysics dark matter
there telescope soon
launched nancy grace roman telescope
say right remind
lady hln uh
talked lot crime
im sorry go ahead couldnt help
nancy grace roman
first head astronomy nasa oh cool
oh one really early
pioneer remind people nasa
launch thing space conduct
science whole separate kind
advocation agency somebody
head astronaut go space
different person heading
science okay think person
responsible thing like hubble
telescope modern time modern
time know first
thing would precursor
hubble telescope precursor
james web space telescope right
know like
mercury astronaut right time
youre mercury astronaut
thinking leading nasa
effort start astronomy mh
uh telescope tuned
detect
whats role telescope
helped lead science team
started helped lead design
kind one uh early
advocate make case first
scientific community nasa
congress dont
anything el good buyin
whole community
pretty tight way im proud
u avoid infighting
yes infight among
beg
money right pretty tight got
tight tight
going basically map entire sky
mhm resolution hubble
telescope holy crap youve seen
hubble image theyre amazing
yeah imagine map whole sky
way mh hubble quality
image much bigger field view
could see much
advanced technology itll let u
map whole sky whats
difference ver ruin
telescope also wide
field mapping sky right
ver rubben telescope operate
optical mhm um itll doible light
visible light amazing thing
still limited
atmosphere space
itll operate
infrared sensitive itll
nice complement actually
reminder infrared doesnt make
earth surface nicely
doesnt make space yeah doesnt make
earth surface lot
thing earth atmosphere
glowing infrared really
gain lot going space youll
much sharper image yeah
think legacy incredibly
broad map whole sky
going discover stuff hadnt
expected mean whenever point
telescope new direction new way
nature surprise u plus
put something rest
many people think miss
something dont expect right
okay see expect
right scientist there
something dont expect thats
first see oh like oh gosh
dont know dont
search bias something ive never
seen oh gosh looking
key missed
20 example think
come visit new york city
come new york want see
tree lighting rockefeller center
okay thats like plan im going
go experience
worthwhile see thats
like design telescope study
dark matter design study nature
dark energy there particular
thing going go
rockefeller center best part
trip new york might someone
rapping hear subway
might person happen meet
might bar might elmo
hopefully might elmo
might band heard
bar went late night yeah
yes went go time square
like know made
airplane reservation planned around
getting lighting christmas
tree mh everything
unexpected ended much better
yeah yeah thats interesting
interesting know way
thats history astronomy
okay youve never seen christmas
tree rockefeller center
light fifth avenue store go
worth going even youre jewish
go yeah interesting say
jew
okay uh one panel
establishing
scoping expected science would
hubble telescope okay
old enough predate
telescope youre going
design telescope unless
plan sucker
going look going
question going answer
look document today
remember telescope nothing
anything forecast
right thats real
testament fertile
uh bit scientific instrument right
there clear difference
course ver ruben telescope
groundbased mean nasa
nothing
groundbased money groundbased people
world
nancy grace roman telescope spaceborn
telescope amazing
speak casually
another space another space telescope
yeah thats great exact oh gosh
cool player
town got europe european space
agency isa working
right issa launched uclid
space uclid many
thing way smaller
version nancy grace roman
telescope okay
sensitive resolution isnt good
still powerful thing
weve operational
right operational
taking data still
calibrating understanding data
made data
theyre taken available yet
clear data
data calibrated
without calibration number mean
nothing right right
big part trying weigh
well dont know
get scale throw spring
idea
calibrating press never
talk public doesnt know
anything half
effort calibrate characterize
data interesting
theorist well invited
telescope chile
phd thesis he theorist
earthquake
earthquake level se ror 7 earthquake
threw spectrograph
thing got dat dont know
looking said
observer god saying dont want
theorist
u blamed earthquake
yes ill take full responsibility
hell
anyway forgot went fun
right cant cannot
cannot argue answer
ever okay uh uclid actually
collaboration nasa isa
thats get connected
ukl know lot
thing nasa isa work together
mh nasa built infrared detector
r ride okay okay
james web space telescope one
important instrument
built european right
really work together
thats science thing
politician havent figured yet
yeah unfortunately saying
guy running world
youre busy
science david came age
u observer
theorist theorist
give pencil pad
observer would go telescope
power computing became
manifest branch field
theorist started using
computer observer started
analyzing data thoroughly
quickly comp phrase
computational
astrophysics mean something specific
different evolved
two branch basically
two branch
theoretical work started
thought universe began worked
forward predict galaxy
like could pet
paper mhm reached point
thing start get complicated
couldnt carry
calculation started
start rely computer
let calculation
couldnt otherwise mhm
computer gotten
powerful detailed
simulation star form
evolve explode theyre
comp youre computing
formula running simulation
universe time scale
dont live long enough see wow
computer thats see
thats awesome know
happened lifetime got tell
let tell story
generation u
important observer chip arp name
halton arp whole name
compiled volume galaxy
looked weird okay called
atlas peculiar galaxy cool
trove wanted study
thing different right
pick object
catalog bring different kind
telescope one knew
came thing
new kind formation process
universe cuz theyre weirded
oddly shaped
movement could bring computer
noticed galaxy
far apart others others
closer others like touching
said wait minute suppose simulate
two galaxy colliding oh would
look like galaxy set
sudden galaxy train wreck
object catalog came
life right werent
different kind object would
uh one mentor gerard
deur said uh know lexus
thats accident
different kind lexus still
lexus
entire branch field
resolved burgeoned whole
understanding colliding galaxy
computational astrophysics
think history star evolve
lifetime star really
first big triumph computational
astrophysics okay actually go
back 50 60 first
computer mh able take
military scientist first
computer right take star like sun
right law physic
understood complicated
law couldnt full
calculation hand evolve
forward describe happened
match pattern see
galaxy go give
confidence right
law physic everywhere
theyre going theyre
going run run
run simulation match
youre like okay
got thats really cool thats
first part take
theory supercharges let
calculation couldnt one
quick add one colleague
department computational
astrophysics specializes
gas like one thing star
galaxy gas
amorphous gas
much yeah model
model right cuz discret
object continuum medium
thats whole thing gas
filled magnetic
field there explosion
propagating shock wave shock
really rich physic
still struggling understand
simulation course
piece observation david
latest understanding
dark matter problem
u nearly hundred year
dont know make
universe okay thats done
heard first adam make
four 5 universe mhm
mhm made atom made
atom everything see made
atom dark
matter five time much
something thats sense
gravitational effect okay dont know
wanted lobby call
dark gravity thats
literally dont know
matter otherwise cant
interact dont know
matter act like matter
sense experience gravity
cluster see cluster
galaxy see behave wait wait wait
wait mean clustering
galaxy five time matter
see galaxy
clustering make
mass galaxy see
behavior different way behaving
experience gravity fall
generates gravity also
experience gravity thats
everythings like star earth
right
experien gravity see earth
sun feel u right
history science know felt
gravitational effect
neptune didnt know yet
went royal
he talking
planet uranus felt effect
uranus uranus effect
astronomer 19th century
calculation realized saw
mercury also noticed
experiencing something
weird fact thought maybe hey
idea worked let try
predicted existence
planet vulcan yeah weve done whole
show vulcan vulcan fan
turn vulcan
general relativity dont know
dark matter name using
describe new particle
havent seen yet right name
using describe fact
general relativity breaking
need something beyond beyond
dont know
helpful question thought
answer learned
dark matter isnt okay oh thats
start thats start yeah yeah
know kind like sherlock
holmes black
hole black hole
attended lecture gave one time
also gave evidence
lost sock lost sock okay
draw like four five sock
dont whats deal
one sock okay like bunch
rock know know weve
eliminated whole bunch thing
massive nutrino weve kind
gone working way list
thing know
good eliminate know thats
figure stuff eliminate
possibility figure
whats right sherlock holmes
right exactly dark matter
beginning right there also
dark energy energy energy
associated empty space mhm
dominates universe determine
fate dont know
mean space aint empty thats
right look else
simon done money one
thing building chile
got first light chile country
happens lay right
mountain andes mountain chile
mean andes mountain
yeah 17000 ft ouch great
elevation really high dry sight
studying clear kek
14000 ft higher k
telescope mona hawaii using
study leftover heat
big bang ooh microwave background
excellent well using
lucky detect gravitational
wave beginning yeah wow
learn universe began
okay 70000 ft one breathing
air service
observing 177000 go
bring oxygen tank look um
everybody look like theyre
nursing home okay right ming
oh got tell one
thing altitude
youre dumber dont know wow
people altitude
there youre less oxygen
yeah youre oxygen deprived youre
oxygen deprived thing
people working
telescope theyre telling
theyre theyre
communicating people back sea
level theyre like giving really
stupid suggestion turn
say add five seven
theyre like yes yeah
cupcake like think one u
altitude let think
take hit oxygen
already first light got first
light starting collect data
start science run soon okay
looking gravitational wave
also measure much detail
pattern polarization
temperature see microwave
background thatll let u determine
age universe composition yeah
um much higher wait youre
ligo type arrangement youre going
detect gravitational wave
observatory youre
going look wave move across
pulsar see timing difference
nope thats yet another way seeing
gravitational think
thats actually seeing wave
yeah seeing wave move
affecting data come back
pul opposed lio detected
wash wash
going watch watch go universe
clever people dude
using
early universe right
gravitational wave detector thats
amazing gravitational wave come
along moved
electron 138 billion year ago
electron theyre moving scatter
light predicted po polarized
pattern look look space
look back time looking
back seeing gravitational wave mve
matter around 138 billion year ago
dont understand cannot love
science hear kind stuff
sit go oh know
care like problem okay
unbelievable ever way
involves completely different
scheme detect gravitational wave
right mean detecting
gravitational wave whose wavelength
comparable size
laughter
music
universe jeez okay let u know
beginning chuck go
chuck go three octav know
blew gasket always
simple like profoundly
brilliantly simple yet like
beautifully elegantly complex
time unbelievable okay think
enough brain filling
day amazing alien wavelength
size universe yeah uh think
full think
science course think
scientist sometimes burning
midnight oil even collaborating uh
coming new idea new
observation new measurement
occasionally really different
groundbreaking make
news general
understanding science
unfolds however part
curtain somewhere back
agency organization
funding stream enable
science first place say
im nasa scientist say
mean there money back
voted congress member congress
voted office public
point origin funding
enables first place
hear science funding
agency want think
fundamental science
without science
yeah garage suppose
lately much happens anybodys
garage science greatest science
unfolds today major
collaboration telescope
particle detector collaboration
domestic
international ju toos
two make science
move cosmic perspective
right dave delight see
chuck always good always
pleasure right star talk
wheel grass tyson always bidding
keep looking
