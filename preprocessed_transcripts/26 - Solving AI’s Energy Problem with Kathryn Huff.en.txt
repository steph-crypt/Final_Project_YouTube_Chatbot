chernobyl fukushima
nuke left bad taste people
mouth youre worried safety
metric matter death per
terat hour generated thats statistic
guy absolutely say
id concerned
statistic death part thats
weird count death much
electricity produced nuclear
energy youll die
music
star talk special edition neil
de grass tyson personal
astrophysicist special edition
know mean weve got gary
oreilly hi neil hey former soccer pro
yes soccer announcer borrowing
soccer people yes okay
special edition think
human condition matter
make work
since injured
soccer player life know
human condition
suffering although im
going place beyond anyone
elses suffering uh get chance
special edition gaze
interesting topic yes yes
love ive got u paul mrio
nice see guy he back yeah yes
always fine right
former stock broker tney merger
acquisition hilar
hilarious became
comedian merger
acquisition well im like
give mother instant heart attack
know oh say said
im going said im going leave
wall street comedian went
looked right eye said
better first joke oh good
one clever mom like uh
yes made right turn got
comedy emmy peabody award
winning mean peabody thats
thats coveted right high
little didnt know youon
cartoon character also
work late show steven co work
late show stephen go back
daily show together sten he
first name st oh sorry st co unlike
he guy tv know
dont know name yeah
paul youre high futin like
still even stand like regular
comedian im high fluent youre
supposed look eye
youre talking thats high fluent
heard rumor broadway show
state show yeah called permission
speak uh involves
disconnected divisive get
together share story realize
common think
involving yeah born
standup liking talk
audience member grown
show great frank oz directing
still blow mind love
frank oz yeah know he
guest show know he constantly
backwards talking though yoda
thing extremely annoying
really cool take around
country folk go website
check going
paul muralcom really cool
sort breakout standup
okay cool gary producer
put together topic
love nuke love
nuke missile kind nuke nuke
predate missile okay know
say nuke mean nucleous
atom energy contained
therein
thats problem
okay set show
ai data center well know
dont quite know yet
going supply rapidly
increasing energy demand reliable
clean energy look
fossil fuel phased well
maybe sustainables suit everyone
need giant nuclear power
plant backyard
option climate change mean energy
must clean reli
economically viable socially
acceptable way see
requires clarity science
expert neil would
like introduce guest would
delighted good love physic peep
theyre one
one join welcoming
katherine huff katherine welcome star
talk great meet great
thanks gotta
voice welcome star
talk excellent thats first time
got get one uh
associate professor
department mouth
like business card worth
department nuclear plasma
radiological
engineering thats right mean
glow night university illinois uh
champagne orbana hang flip
card go back card
oh keep going yes phd
nuclear engineering
youve actually tour duty
serving
federal government assistant
secretary nuclear energy
department energy uh
2022 20 24 little tour
duty youve seen
katherine could remind
everybody difference fusion
fision yeah fision
conventional nuclear power
united state around world
separate break apart uh heavy atom
like uranium 235 plutonium 239
whereas fusion gain energy
binding reaction two light
particle fusing would
isotope helium hydrogen typically
youre talking completely
different end periodic table
force hold nucleus together
binding energy nucleus
achieve net increase net sort
output energy coming
isotop curve splitting big
atom coming uh fusing two
light atom thats
shape binding energy curve
nucleus know
astrophysics peak curve
depending plot way
base curve iron star
give ghost hit iron
cant fizz fuse
get energy suck energy
star business making energy
hit iron
thats wrote collapse
explodes rebound
supernova know
astrophysics there quite
relationship nuclear
physicist thinking
star universe let
let try let open
chernobyl three
mile island
fukushima know nuke left bad
taste people mouth
always way
became evidence there
lot
branding thats going
happen going forward
nuclear energy going rejoin
conversation
challenge squaring circle
source energy people typically talk
especially green movement
nuclear energy
kind wnab part
conversation yeah absolutely think
lot around numerics right
talking people metric
matter youre worried safety
metric matter death per
terawatt hour generated
thats statistic guy
say would say id
concerned statistic
death death part yes thats
weird count death much
electricity produced energy
youll die
exist
coal yeah interesting
metric youre using compare
energy source number
different data set informed
number death per terawatt hour
solar wind coal etc nuclear way
way way bottom near know
slightly solar wind actually
even include fukushima
chernobyl interestingly death
three island know
geothermal think one
one lower nuclear term
death per terawatt hour
construction project there serious
issue maintaining wind turbine like
putting thing roof installing
sort thing doesnt happen
nuclear construction site
incredible amount regulation
really left like accident
there plenty life cycle
analysis death also know
carbon per terot hour
reality nuclear term
generation higher
denominator huge wait higher
return high there
power generated per per whatever per
anything ter aatt hour
higher yes long shot yes oh
thats win get course
pulled fast denominator numerator
math stay pulled
right turn
youre
geral treadmill producing
energy kill thousand geral
didnt make much energy begin
right death rate relative
energy return ratio bad
correct im wrong
catherine nuke potent
capacity produce energy whoever
died whatever there much
energy produced
compensates
relative number relative correct
doesnt beg regulation
sort renewables like youre right
solar like know guy
working jiffy lube selling
solar panel putting half
drunk like isnt sound like bad
experience behalf yeah call
uncle way precise
example uncle archie
anything doesnt sort
beg level sort
there level sort death rate
relative renewables interestingly
renewables like wind solar
geothermal nuclear theyre
category
magnitude magnitude lower
fossil know nuclear end
winning historically nuclear
largest source carbon free
emission free power right
emission fossil
know really take
completely different order magnitude
term death per terawatt hour
would say renewables safe
nuclear safe geothermal safe
really fossil need
worried youre talking
safety impact human health
really demonstrable clear way uh
many people ever died mining
coal great question right
estimated kind thing
full total cost death fossil
industry separate
particulate related premature death
whatnot dont know exact number
people dying coal
zero okay pretty high way
physicist say zero
doesnt mean one
two pretty high right like
would lose people collapse okay
weve got clean high energy production
totality fusion fishing
still radioactive material
going make people unhappy
zero backyard dont put
nimes
mean thats theyre
spelled capital want
know thats
doesnt sound clean cant
point fact nuclear power
around year people
accepted fact there
radioactive way sort hanging
anyway like completely new
concept well theyre accepting
theyre accepting
disposal plan katherine
told u paul right
know hasnt huge impact
human daytoday life
incredibly small volume spent fuel
fision reactor 60 year
spent nuclear fuel know
producing close 20 electric
power united state
produced enough material sort
ignore packaging focus
uranium fill football field
tall know meter high
people seem ignore put
right bag sunday night
put garbage
radioactive material theyll pick
yeah yeah thats right going
put blue bag put
staten island remind live
neighborhood ever exactly there
glowing paul house yeah thing
stuff get buried far deep
wa wait youre youre mix
middle nowhere youre mixing
two thing think theyre separable
variable youre saying nuke dirty
fision dirty fusion isnt
dirty understand thats true
doesnt happen yet catherine
world world thinking
combining together
solution going forward totally
leaning fusion excited recent
sort ignition test went
livermore lab im fion girl
im sort classic nuclear energy
fusion person great optimism
fusion take quite long
time interestingly probably know
nif test inertial
confinement fusion experiment lot
commercial proposal attemp
ing commercialize fusion near
term like eer device
france magnetic confinement
fusion slightly different
approach seeing real breakthrough
eater device may quite
year know await
breakthrough thing like first
wall protection thing like
im kind conventional
nuclear energy advanced vision
energy thats sort horizon
right correct fold
conversation im still
waiting mr fusion home fusion
back future yeah
thing seems like dont quite
handle fusion make right
operate way really want
yet ext extension
plasma fusion
break even issue right heat
go get heat thats
extension traditional fusion
process right operating
fusion reactor
like could someday maybe
guy tried harder would
yeah im fusion scientist
like work
nuclear go went way
way department
energy left office
night would turn thermostat
im curious absolutely okay good
absolutely every light switch
little dont forget turn like
sticker mh okay going
major consumer energy going
forward ai data center sure
look maybe quantum computing weve
got bit mining throw development
electric vehicle mean may
already calculated ive joined
doe obviously may
calculated already
calculated enough term
exponentially consumption going
go yeah totally data center
thing like also increased
electrification like ev
kind thing well
increased sort revival industrial
manufacturing requires
electricity heat see carbon free
steel company wanting start
united state dont
enough heat get heat
usually burn fossil fuel
clean energy source available
provide direct heat nuclear
yeah huge
amount demand even factoring
know projection
much new gwatt worth know many ten
gigawatts worth capacity going
needed support data center
center coming decade support
kind endeavor grow
grow every time look news
position
existing clean energy infrastructure
expand support data center
especially data center need 247
reliable always power
multibillion dollar data center
dont want running 2
capacity wind stop blowing
need 100 power 247 regardless
issue sort
data center going
continue everywhere
scaling traditional power plant
nuclear power plant get
smr smrs right fully
developed yet paul could tell
rest u smr mean uh small
modular reactor get right
catherine yeah know
exhausting carry
guy time sense
proximity issue right
data center far away
source nuclear source
energy youre going loss data
loss energy becomes sort
able build lot smrs
smaller closer
data center yeah youre absolutely
right transmission especially building
new high voltage power line move
gigawatts power generator
consumer expensive know cut
land usually need permit
sometimes slow
collocated data center smaller
modular reactor build
advantage modularity
build certainly also supposed
contribute speed reliability
deploy idea
take really long time
build gigawatt scale nuclear power
plant build
30 know sized 300 megawatt reactor
maybe build
get lesson learned maybe
move little faster might paying
slightly per kilowatt hour
able deploy quicker
learn faster coming
cost curve construction
learning thats whole future
yet realized weve
probably last major nuclear
power plant built 30 something year ago
united state yes united
state around developed nation
youre saying new
technology small modular
reactor smrs
advanced reactor youve got
micro reactor youve
different sort acronym going
right
technology option
fishing fusion going forward
know youve got
close nimes going dance
scream like merry hell
know going sort
technology yeah
think technology size
advanced reactor space
recent two build united state
vogal unit 3 four
ap 1000 westinghouse theyre
big like conventional nuclear reactor
incorporate passive safety
theyre kind generation
three plus design sort big
gigawatt scale built pretty
schedule budget
there lot trend towards shrinking
kind design light waterer
reactor thats smaller youve got
design htech ge hitachi
westinghouse shrunken version
ap1000 three ap300 yeah youve
got new scale one small
modular light waterer reactor design
addition
also build small modular advanced
reactor design number
company pursuing commercialization
two deployment already
happening support
department energy would involve
advanced coolant fuel like
sodium liquid metal
salt yeah msrs yeah
sodium sodium couple
cool feature
coolant highly conductive
extremely performant move
heat fuel needed
turbine exchange
process eventually conduction
really useful also
helpful neutronics control
criticality talked
earlier absorbs neutron yeah
keep neutron fast
moderating combine
metal fuel sodium cooled fast reactor
opportunity quite
passively safe using reactor physic
negative feedback expansion
fuel expansion
coolant sort neutronic behavior
coolant drive power
power go high keeping thing balanced
regulated isnt practicality
issue though corrosion
problem process right
critically sodium case
liquid metal combined
something else becomes salt
salt reactor talk
yeah sodium also somewhat
cor corrosive cant see
liquid metal
pyrophoric get wet tends
burst flame good yeah thats
good know get wet
spend quick second reminding
u dont want simplify much
correct ive done
end youre trying create
source heat raise temperature
water spin
turbine magnetic field
coil generate electricity
thats way weve making
electricity since faraday thats half
old school correct half
old school yeah correct yes
almost exactly like coal plant
youre boiling water
different way different way
different source heat mean
goal get even higher temperature
mean aiming building star
earth star
earth would pretty hard
fision await fusion colleague
matter fision reactor
deployed
advanced coolant get much
much hotter safely conventional
reactor talking 800 degree
celsius really high temperature
quite bit 300 degree
se would usually see
conventional light water reactor
higher temperature water mean
pressure guess right yeah
absolutely youre going use
heat directly useful
industrial application like
know reducing steel reducing iron
steel making process rather
making electricity
turbine right rather burning
natural gas coal make direct heat
first application x energy
high temperature gas reactor
dow chemical plant well theyll
use direct heat
electricity convert
heat straight reactor
wont converted
electricity well temperature
high cant generate electricity
robust lack better term
travel farther distance
without loss exactly way
convert heat electricity
isly
case case high
temperature heat higher quality
easier convert
little bit less loss yeah good
important point okay hear
neil next
iteration smartphone right
youve got big clunky cell phone
used back 80
shoulder mounted one used
one magnum pi would
gecko right right
shoulder mounted remember okay 1987
saw movie real time
im looking said gee wish
rich phone like want
phone suitcase theyre
getting smaller smaller
getting higher temperature
sound lot like smartphone
much cost who paying
well think confused
two thing whats also happening
chip getting efficient
right laptop used burn
top thigh doesnt
anymore putting exactly
exactly thigh
katherine quantum
computing much computing
less time ultimately thats less
consumption energy isnt
yeah one would hope right
use energy thing
advance human prosperity right
uh also use displace
kind fossil energy still
rely contributes climate
crisis small modular reactor
said mrr thank reminding
much actually cost
writing particular check
remains seen precisely much
much design cost
looking scenario would would
refer liftoff report de
put estimate new
nuclear power know going
order
120 per megawatt hour first
kind way nth kind
maybe 60 per meat hour range
thats big range similar
kind range seeing
look know renewables plus grid
scale storage
comparable reliable 247 clean energy
involves renewables right
alternative would new natural gas
carbon capture cheaper certainly
maybe 100 high end
60 per megawatt hour low end
geothermal big range
similar nuclear know 130
high end 57 low end hydro
power always cheap recently
iceland nearly 100 geothermal
mean theyre sitting top multiple
volcanic issue partly
like there two stream technology
battling word
demand energy right like year
2060 there going
12230 streaming service alone right
okay youre going house plant
self waterer self fertilize
talk right
seriousness keep
know lazy fusion
people clearly arent pushing
envelope know phoning
seriousness
develop energy fast enough keep
incredible demand
become
efficient like would say total
wattage light bulb house
probably 100 watt thats got 50
light bulb theyre led okay
right katherine dont even
shut light leave
room cuz dont need
advance mean there guilt
inducing mirror going come
soon stand front
say really thats
want eat like like seem hit
nerve one
talking life
one exactly
seriousness
technology thats needed
keep demand new
demand havent even foreseen
yet great question doe
estimated want hit net
zero 2050 net zero net zero
carbon carbon thank okay yeah
build least 550 770
new gws firm clean power
hydro know geothermal
thing like battery storage
least 200 gaw need
nuclear one
made calculation across
world dozen country
committed tripling nuclear energy
country since
flat earthers among u dont say across
world say around world okay
give sentence
get get
absolutely yeah around world dozen
country committed tripling
nuclear power right
football field meter high worth
spent nuclear fuel right correct yes
new advanced
modular small modular reactor good
friend
smr going able
recycle spent fuel
could know mentioned sodium cooled
fast reactor earlier metal
fuel terra power isnt
currently planning recycle
united state amable technology
kind recycling
nation france example recycles
great deal spent nuclear fuel
resulting lower volume lower mass
much shorter lifetime longterm
radioactivity
putting longest lived
useful isotope back reactor uh
could united
state dont currently
infrastructure would
take real government effort move
forward recycling know
de definitely something
continuing research
great deal
interest commercial side
seeing recycling back table
term option molten salt reactor
also mentioned earlier
note smr msr universe molt
salt reactor also amable
recycling like asmr universe
yeah yes
hows nuclear power
yes tell yes still
mining uranium there still plenty
uranium left earth crust
yeah still mining uranium um
best uranium world come
mine canada exists
lot place including united
state australia kazakhstan
braing oh gosh soon yeah think
reality unless great
deal recycling youre going
continue mine uranium yeah
recycling would reduce need new
fresh uranium isnt part
issue geopolitical concern
right come
great technology andmr feed
data center there lot uranium
theyre every
country country
borderline sort friendly terrorist
take like factor
simultaneous
technology developed away
nuclear energy
dependent uranium
potential hotline
state department know basically
come going back relying
one single exactly yeah think
thats come right
thats right there trouble
one sector shift economics
youll single point
failure everything running oil
fossil fuel there problem
biggest bottle neck uranium
fuel cycle know mining
uranium there lot source
processing conversion
enrichment fuel
increase number isotope
uranium 235 per kilogram total
uranium enrichment process
fuel fabrication process happen
much smaller number facil
internationally yeah know
quite quite point international
collaboration necessary
ensure know russia
dominated historically conversion
enrichment capability last 20
year decided sell
united state needed
capability u among
ally france uk etc
underway fact right behind
law reband russia
uranium uh russia know import
near term could
protect ability invest
new enrichment capability katherine
whats called spent uranium mh
basically waste product
fision uranium fision mean
recycle boost
isotope back stick
particle accelerator
uranium would
accomplish there two different
way basically sped fuel
start mixture uranium
atom split fision product
two part uranium atom split
might iodine teesi
practically know half
isotope periodic table uh
chart nucleid mixture need
separated fision
product removed total
already split atom think
public generally familiar
chart nucleotide uh
know periodic table element
thats mysterious chart
box sat front
chemistry class table
nucleotide always
advanced chemistry class one
didnt go physic class
list element
isotope possible
element thats complicated
diagram correct quite bit
complicated extremely
useful nuclear engineer
end producing lot isotope
inside reactor fision
process okay track
whereabouts make little
cocktail find one work
better able
take forward thats interesting
idea know um fall
chemistry group useful
industrial application thing like
one interesting
possibility recycling ill
get second one
interesting possibility
recycling product
arent useful reactor
otherwise waste
product hard generate otherwise
useful
know medical reason imaging
kind radioactive listed technum
one byproduct ive seen
used medical uh imaging
thats mean possibly
recycling material
absolutely technum 99 meta stable
routinely used thing like thyroid
imaging whatnot right right cool
picking dumpster
exactly thats right specialized
high precision uh radioactive dumpster
yeah cant boost
uranium back isotope need
run
generally speaking end
take fision product
still great deal
enriched material left
fision process breeding
little bit plutonium
uranium 238 atom absorbed
neutron another neutron
move way chart
nucleates plutonium 239
also file put
uranium plutonium back
reactor usefully along
transuranic element thats
recycling aquous
chemistry electrochemistry thats
different recycling plastic
got carry weight
waste product thats right thats
right itll time could take
l nuclear waste dump
sunday make dump run
sort
sort got
right little bin right sort
waste guy sort
radiation got guy yeah
pay 50 buck
he easy find he glowing
explain going sound
like nei question like
havent gotten better reducing
amount radioactive waste get
generated process
attempt
scientist
lazy first volume
pretty small start yeah
there lot work fuel
utilization amount fuel
put used maximum
extent practical lot
resulted design leverage
higher initial enrichment uranium
youll see lot small
modular reactor design
allows reactor smaller
lot case itll allow higher
fuel efficiency fuel utilization
kind radioactive wass get
fast
reactor metal uranium plutonium
fision product object right
never sort sort come
reactor going
format know get lot
simpson kind image look
like glowing green go goo spent
nuclear fuel actually uranium oxide
coming conventional reactor
type ceramic quite heavy
little pellet
solid uh quite dull case
sodium cooled fast reactor would
solid metal cylinder case
molten salt reactor uranium
dissolved liquid salt
reactor dont really exist
commercially yet theyve
proposed would liquid
would kind reactor
sort liquid waste spent
fuel sort turned ceramic
deep underground
cu thats kind way originates
earth begin extract
kind send back
similar state yeah rock
come put
back solid uh uranium oxide
typically contained
canister thats steel concrete
layer upon layer shielding
katherine theyre equally
safe yeah fairly straightforward
um maintain fision reaction
stable steady state point
development technology
feedback could drive
reaction super criticality um
spend lot time
balancing reaction reactor
whereas fusion reaction tendency
end hard
make fusion reactor hard
reaction maintain hard
maintain there
sort opportunity easy super
criticality dont end
situation might become
overpowered create lot extra heat
werent ready melt thing
etc fundamentally since stable
state fusion reaction
happening little bit easier
keep safe dont uh
radioactive
byproduct fusion
activated byproduct kind
high level fision product
radioactive long time
well manage spent nuclear
fuel fision gotcha
dispose careful way thats
right multiple nation making
real progress fin finland
start operating
final repository canada
selected site final
repository sweden gotten permission
begin constructing final
reposit mhm one quick point
think fear factor
accident kill many many
people there coal
mining accident
tout death per terawatt hour
nuke look good dont
look good there disaster
terrorist take plant
becomes target weapon
there kind radioactive
leakage fision
fusion maybe said
selfdriven maybe youll snuff
tell someone
who concerned
widespread damage would
accident relative source
death source energy
time bring person
nuclear power plant would show
containment structure
dont would show video
sandia
experimenting structure
protect u nuclear power plant
accident sandia
ffrdc yeah sandia national laboratory
new mexico new mexico think
yeah thats correct albuquerque
experiment show could
ram jet engine right side
con containment building sort
standard steel concrete structure
dome reactor
survives fine thought
actual experiment conduct
mission
impossible filming
throw tom wanted new
challenge talking
neighborhood right want
get people come board
great education give people knowledge
safety want get people
board nuclear
powerplant small large
neighborhood put chickfila
got chickfila attached
nuclear power plant people board
little drivethru enjoy
uh thats work never knew
new pr campaign department
nclear exactly nuclear waste
chickfila bring power plant like
produce lot job tax
revenue community love maybe
use build
chickfila okay data center
connected surprisingly enough
people behind ai tech bros
important
model going forward clean
reliable energy surely tech bros
going driving whole thing
along nuclear energy become
goto source energy
future seeing already weve
seen request proposal power
purchase agreement signed ensure
new reactor coming online
amazon invested x energy
microsoft invested restarting
three mile island unit uh
clear demonstration money
already going towards new
deployment restarts think
helpful deep
pocket working towards reducing
risk theind build yeah
hopefully going result power
even tech company going
need thats need
country see everquest
capitalism market anything
smrs become
small literally theyll
marketed could
nuclear reactor house right like
could see day power generator thats
whole fusion thats like give
whole new meaning nuking leftover
li literally n leftover here
here example 1968 movie 2001
came imagining world 2001
33 year
could
figure future computing
would distributed rather
centralized modern
computer one giant computer
controlling whole ship super
brain super one brain
werent thinking could
miniaturized dont need whole room
fit hip watch
movie watch different movie
exactly gary referenced
comparison smartphone development
could get reactor could get
small thats thats question
back expert future
possibility let add im
impressed level private
enterpris participating trying
solve energy future dont
think always like
like city power plant
county
utility thing
government
entrepreneurial atmosphere seems
yeah want invent buy
product want go
picnic show go anybody want
smoothie go im going power
nuclear min miniaturized
seems like overkill
yeah shake
damn good smoothie way make
energy powder strawberry banana
probably overkill
especially regulatory nuclear
nonproliferation community want
make sure certain nuclear material
kept extremely well controlled
observed counted know tracked uh
there universe
could put suitcase uh
briefcase there potential
make dirty bomb spent
fuel there many bad actor around
unlicensed im say
throwing way
future far future yeah mr
fusion little nuclear home friend mr
fusion mean far actually
away thing obviously
tested far away
commercially able bring
situation go online yeah
first couple early
stage construction
expecting completed
hope fiveyear construction
timeline itll probably like
10 year dont
order book
next year two
wait another 10 year
next one seeing
data center kind
company utility like dominion
thinking small modular reactor
see order thats
opportunity first
deployment five 10 year
know connected grid
followed next many want
one basement want able
go party say got nuclear
reactor basement think
anyones going stay party
exactly want first
one block nuclear power
reactor looking like
walk right got
land plane katherine uh
working right
wrun research group writes
software modeling simulating
advanced reactor fuel cycle
lot weve talking
today write multiphysics software
graduate student
multiphysics mean mean
yeah combine different
physic especially youre combining
physic different scale case
neutronics small sort
angstrom 10 the4 second kind
time scale thermal hydraulics
like second meter
two thing affect
youre talking
reactor feedback reactor accident
actual reaction tiny little
nuclear thing plug
macroscopic facility
draw energy hadnt thought
way multiphysics word
thats right multiscale multiphysics
want sound high futin thats
size time scale
well phenomenon thats right thats
right study advanced reactor like
mol salt reactor high
temperature gas reactor sodium cool
fast reactor recycling strategy
uh something really important
okay earn keep
university also teach
absolutely uh favorite thing
whole wide world im sure
understand cool
make sure shes honest
broker sound lot like
seem like youd great
youre relatable make
understandable somebody uh
doesnt know world could borrow
joke though dont think theyre
laugh enough uh 50 buck joke youre
want go bunker
whole place melt nuclear
know got best bunker know
get go party
reactor
basement go come full
well let offer cosmic perspective
right may may yeah
u old enough remember back
50 60 people
imagining
future didnt wait
longer month maybe even
week one major magazine
life magazine look magazine cover
story city tomorrow home
tomorrow transportation tomorrow
food tomorrow youd see
artist illustration tomorrow
would look like tomorrow
infinitely far away like
lifetime every single one
projection got wrong assumption
wed unlimited access
energy every one
illustration flying car
motorized sidewalk everything
motion power source energy
source got wrong
didnt walk future unlimited
energy walked future cheap
computing became information
technology future energy
technology future wonder
hearing development
horizon need require
perhaps though long overdue
doorstep future
derive energy one
dozen way much
need anything want
cosmic perspective join
thanking katherine huff
brilliant exposition state
industry dude always fun good
good man absolutely tell
frank said hi became
good friend show
yeah he fan
uh
okay laughing cuz
funny right gary well catch
next time star talk special
edition neil degrass tyson always
bidding keep looking
music
