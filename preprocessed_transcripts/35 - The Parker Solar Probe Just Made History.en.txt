heard anything parker solar
probe lately whats parker
solar probe named eugene
parker solar
physicist back
1950s proposed crazy idea maybe
sun releasing particle
surface form today
would call solar wind
particle would stream
solar system collide planet
possibly generating earth aurora well
going confirm
use telescope really
kind want go well thats
hard dangerous sun
hot finally engineering came
pas design construction
remarkable space probe became reality
reason im talking
parker solar probe made
closest approach sun
close closest weve ever
sent anything sun five sun
diameter away since sun
huge gravitational field anything
fly close sun
speed increase gravitational
attraction sun result
parker solar probe reached
highest speed ever humanmade
craft hit top speed
430000 hour fast 430000
hour thats fast terrestrial
standard universe amount
61 100ths
1 speed light get
point show
fast moving high become
make measurement sun
deeply understand call
solar weather storm sun
release particle space
actually way heating outer
atmosphere sun call
corona corona whats rendered
visible total solar eclipse
million degree much hotter
sun surface reason
remain little bit
mysterious however sparsely
populated gas molecule hot would
feel dont dont know
particle hit youre
bathed complete solution hot
gas corona
likely could survive
fine even though million
degree would much damaging
devastating radiant
heat coming surface sun
parker solar probe
doesnt melt shielded
substance element
periodic table highest
melting point could
metal highest melting
point element table far
carbon there carbon composite
shield rather thick
nonetheless protect sun
always oriented way
shield rest electronics
make measurement magnetic
field particle flux whatever
might heating mechanism
corona sun closeup personal
guess say thats touching
sun cuz corona part
sun full atmospheric structure
size shape youre told
probe touch sun
thinking youre probably thinking
going skim surface sun
like thats going
five solar diameter away
surface little human interest fact
there little memory card
flying mission photo
eugene parker file containing
original paper published 1958
making radical prediction
would would become solar wind
well name 11 million people
people want little piece
name participate
exploration solar system
particular case kiss sun
sun nearest star space
earth understand
better able accommodate
idiosyncrasy sun cycle
11 22year cycle uh
remains bit mysterious u
scared little bit explosion
sun send flux particle
power knock
much orbiting satellite unless
satellite electronically
hardened expression go
particularly susceptible modern
time given much economy
national security depends space
asset know space
weather generated sun better
thats little
bit whats
music
