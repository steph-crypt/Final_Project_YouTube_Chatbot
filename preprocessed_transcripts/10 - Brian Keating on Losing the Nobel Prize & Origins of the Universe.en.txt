hell know
temperature
thousandth degree room
temperature fluctuates degree
exactly whole universe
universe small
talking equilibrium
temperature equilibrium quickly
expanded hence justification
inflation yes right
expansion give
uniformity across entire
expansion correct wow okay im done
need cosmic aquarius come back
star talk neil degrasse tyson
personal astrophysicist
cosmic query today
guess brought chuck nice
chuck man hey thats right
bought good brought
good yes got got
got everything ever
wanted know im going read
four
cuz thats many get think
theyre fleshy reply
way look
reservoir inquiry
give u fodder discussion
eventually question
answered right
question patreon
supporter love
love going cosmology today
oh hair special today
im happy im glad
cosmetology
cosmetology yeah thats
weve got u today one
active scientist space
space cosmetology
laughter
brian keading brian welcome star
talk nice person
finally right yes yes uh youre
active social medium honored
guest podcast yeah two
time guest yeah two time guest
whats name called
impossible podcast named
arthur c clark famous dictim
way discovering limit
possible go beyond
impossible oh uh realize
get impossible
possible well dont know
realize rational
chuck youve uh thinking
cosmology especially uh signature
big bang yeah uh whole
career yeah ive
dedicated life
understanding know happened
tuesday big bang
answer question really
sure tuesday wait let get
pedigree way youre
chancellor distinguished professor
physic department physic uc
san diego right
student distinguished professor
know well dont care
chancellor think wow
teach
right go office
get private lesson thats funny uh
youre also principal investigator
simon observatory weve got
whole simon thing
city flat iron institute thats
right yeah jim titan city
fortunately passed away last year age
86 jim simon jim simon yeah he
philanthropist mathematician
multiple career worked
government broke code
vietnam said philanthropist
mathematician order
order also
reverse order left one thing
hedge fund manager 26th richest person
world one one thing thats
important left uh uh
wife marilyn simon
distinction honor
asteroid mean lot people
asteroid got asteroid named
jim anybodys got asteroid
well yeah duh marilyn let
honest solar system littered
theyre basically space garbage
let honest cant give away
man
as join join
dont one either uh
marilyn honor distinction
one first babysitter
got experience early experience
dark matter change
diaper thats right dark matter
got experience wow
yeah age age two three yeah wow
guy go way back way back
birth
personal big bang chuck said nine
month earlier
uh uh whats simon
observatory whats relationship
im whats called
principal investigator yeah uh im
cofounder along
friend david spurggle mark uh
came together graduate school
yeah yeah david spurggle
earlier episode star talk
chair committee representing nasa
investigating uaps yes yeah he
also archive he also
took marilyn simon
president simon foundation
okay kind withdraw
simon observatory otherwise
conflict interest interest mean
thing
really people like david yeah
ethical people yeah um 2014
city published
uh front page new york
time march 17th st patrick day
published article said
space ripple herald origin
universe announcement
bicep 2 experiment detected
called gravitational wave
primordial wave ripple
spaceime bicep uh thats acronym
whats acronym created
acronym background imager
cosmic extragalactic polarization
checking bicep want something
want yeah exactly dont
disc whats looking space gun
gun okay give back acronym
space gun show background background
imager cosmic extragalactic
polarization
clever dad joke
well signal looking
called polarization
polarization pattern
able see special polarized
glass well get second
would see swirling twisting
curling pattern wanted make
bicep muscle curl
got away dad joke even
kid see see
thats bad
curl tell exercise one muscle
muscle curl bicep
thats right right good
yeah
project well founded
previous predecessor experiment called
creatively bicep one first
incarnation like
iphone every couple year
upgrade get pixel get
detail cool thing
literally isnt
orbiting south pole
antarctica oh
bottom world oh gosh yeah
thats right um penguin would
call top world thats
right dont want know
polar bear specific yeah uh
created experiment along
late great um colleague mentor
andrew lang uh tragically took
life soon got first data
second version
experiment thats another podcast
uh experiment built
intently nothing else measure
wave gravity existed
thought oh well never detect
minuscule looking
signal 1 billionth
kelvin cmbbs average
temperature 27 kelvin
say minuscule didnt think wed
try challenge
scientifically see signal
low given fluctuation
already earth
atmosphere yep radiating
experiment thats right
exactly yep literally like
string bell
crazy thing 2014
know announced saw
kind needle know
actually like piece hay hay
stack know find
hay hay stack thats funny
piece hay
thats funny know
needle actually iron man said
one movie
knew okay want find
needle haststack burn
hay stack needle left
thats right cuz needle dont
burn take electromagnet yeah
youll find needle like
experiment designed one
thing never thought wed
detected wed
know kind onus
experimentalist know want
know enough detect
know fall victim
pernicious scientific
fallacy confirmation bias
youre looking something oh
found eureka never happens
right found
remember telling wife know
going win somebody nobel prize
know spoiler alert know
first book called losing nobel
prize wasnt wasnt guy
um wasnt u
retracted later neil
mentioned go
humiliation front
page new york time press
conference harvard know real
show around world cnn
everybody academic
affiliation time
professor uc san diego
correct ive 21 year
probably running
oh yeah front
page important
paper record san diego union
tribune union tribune
cover yes exactly
discovery launched motion
would become simon observatory
day got call jim
simon already funding
predecessor experiment mine called
simon array small
grouping telescope meant also
look signal
signal called
distinctive voice uh know
smoking merit cigarette without filter
know 60 year started
smoking know late
teenage dont know
doctor yeah chain
smoker hey brian exactly
sounded like boston
got boston oh cant
boston
plus doesnt sound good boston
know oh thats wicked like
know
wicked like yeah thats diner
waitress voice really yeah yeah brian
keating team helping u
piece together one biggest
puzzle cosmology dark matter
energy new finding may shaking
everything thought knew data
suggests dark energy might weakening
meaning universe expansion could
actually slowing true
would challenge one biggest
assumption modern physic
rewrite textbook need
clarity thats exactly star
continues partner ground news
built app website help
u separate speculation science
one swipe find original

complicated life
bicep 2 experiment reported
would later determined
erroneous detection meanwhile
jim simon
seeing youre seeking yeah wanted
participate put head
early version simon
observatory variant simon
array yeah bicep 2
result come thats right
good thats right
bicep 2 leading world well
think discovered
ripple exactly really
havent doesnt know
he like bro whats
money right okay want back
call im like dont
know say knew
back mind could problem
result might need
confirm another instrument
later turned case
actually right yeah
maybe might say look
got get got give back
money got integrity
know refund money
speak going crazy cuz
get know 10 million
give back adam thats let
tell something thats
ran integrity
ran money integrity
time 10 10 10 million
integrity
determined yeah cuz
remembered wasnt close
happening
important important
episode science actually okay
tell important
even get tell
exactly missing
discovery invalidated absolutely
let take one giant step back
project begin
looking gravitational
wave take back 2014
right hadnt detected ligo
made detection gravitational
wave obama president
ukraine invaded first
time hold guy give one second
im staving said obama
president im like oh god
elevator risen okay go
ahead annoy chuck uh
phase detected
gravitational wave directly ligo
indirect evidence
existed uh
theory promagated since
early 1980s alan guth
inflationary theory answer
question caused big bang
made big bang bang postula
there socalled quantum
field filled whole universe
fluctuated nothing
universe became came existence
quantum quant
stuff nothing
time magician
universe yes everything quantum
actually pull universe
hand thats exactly
universe
fluctuation go right
discovery true
confirmed would tantamount
discovering big bang
done far pensas
wilson discovery cmbb
cosmic microwave background
butter bread around keing
house pius wilson bell lab
jersey exactly far
state way across
hudson river make far thats
right okay know youre
san diego dont dont listen
long island he man im new
yorker life new jersey
true long island
root uh yeah thats stony brook
yeah stony oh god yeah thats
jim dad professor oh
thats would case
inflation claimed
discovered thats everyone
said going win nobel prize
nobel prize
discovering heat left
big bang
discovering ignited spark
ignited big bang
designed bicep originally
became bicep 2 like iphone get new
detector camera upgraded
ended building telescope
got call jim
simon pickle right
dont know say kind
invented kind father
predecessor experiment bicep 2
bicep one know definitely
father
involved new project
funding ended happening
relied data
instrument actually someone
taken picture powerpoint slide
arch nemesis plank
experiment plank experiment
billion euro experiment bicep
mere10 million u dollar european
space agency l2range point
orbiting around sun earth
farthest coldest deepest darkest
incredible team thousand people
working earth sun l2 earth sun l2
thats jwsc yeah exactly
one first second
one hanging theyre
chilling theyre chilling like theyre
steakout two cop steakout
sitting l2
go coffee time
went coffee last time true
cuz theyre like parked yeah
earth orbit sun think
getting validation mean
easy jim call
whats going next
ended discovering didnt
see pattern would
impromaturtor big bang didnt
see cosmic swirling curl
big bang determined didnt see
along competitor
plank team worked together
find actually saw
nothing cosmic schmutz
right dust people
study dust call thats right
livelihood one
astronomer dust another
astronomer nobel lost nobel prize
wasnt blunder joke wasnt like
left know put thumb
camera something like
actually measured exquisitly
precisely signal
astrophysical origin mill
billion degree kelvin level mean
exquisite local
signal big happened
different signal exactly thats
congratulation precision
merit idiot interpreting
wrong way however
like oh thing work
experiment basically
precise measurement whats called
astrophysical foreground something
foreground know
space cosmos
made astrophysics actually
material make meteorite
brought meteorite
guy dust ubiquitous
type dust obscured
measurement prevented
winning nobel prize actually
stuff planet made
identical happens
magnetic produce radiation
heat saw
misinterpreted signal
baby produce um infrared infrared
microwave emission yep jin simon
upon hearing he like well
retracted
claim detected inflation
humiliating hum
like easy thing still said
want go signal ever
remove dust
good thing like said chuck
actually good thing make
mistake say oh got refine
like go
car there dust windshield got
clean windshield except youre
going uni galaxy
removing dust youre removing
dust signature data exactly
without vacuum cleaner
dust devil need way
exactly jim
wise david spurggle
figured cuz one one
killed bicep
interpretation figured need
multiple color light bicep
2 one color light
couldnt see multiple color
multiple color learn
spectrum learn
characteristic simon
observatory jim funded
see cosmic signal
assume may
want
also see dust
signal
cosmic signal plus dust signal
telescope saying
one band light exactly
could distinguish cosmic signal
local signal two band
light show
differently two band youll
able identify youve
able take take
thats remember
episode remember ambulance
chasing theorist came behind
false result thinking real coming
explanation get
nobel prize thats right
wow thats remember got email
like 100 theory many theory
well there 1800 paper published
cited paper
embarrassingly enough um yeah
led
disaster sense led
know initiation new
powerful instrument ever made
cosmic micro background thats
thats science observatory science
pi congratulation
thank much yeah thats
cool thats great story got got
get oh write book
familiar
polaroid sunglass
subset
know theyre think
people dont type
sunglass want always
polarized sunglass
backpack cuz never know
need pull need hide
paparazzo
flash might bounce
something need need
polarizing sunglass block
bounce light catch u
polarized observation work
yeah light three primary
property color spectrum
intensity bright light
also something called polarization
least familiar property light
light electromagnetic wave
wave oscillates plane
oscillating
electric field vector going
like magnetic field
vector going like two
wave one going
sorry thats right one going
one going side
side
magnetic electromagnetic
okay light interacts
matter see like glare see
reflection well polarized
sunglass oppress
suppress one
oppress come see youre
sitting two people take
different understanding word
show know one day thats
right going able get
see mountain top using
polariz see side
know sometimes feel tired
like im tide light tired light
oh man got get
broll right good way
polarized sunglass work
actually suppress one two
polarization state light happens
horizontal one thats
want wear beach
want wear youre
driving get glare
skiing absolutely yeah absolutely
skin thats theyre
expensive add
film thats molecule
actually made polymer actually
suppress one two state
light let rest
dont want totally dark right
polarized sunglass suppress one
two polarization state light
make light 50 darker also
photography called neutral density
filter exactly yeah film
thats uh glass
actually knock one two
polarization state light one
responsible glare
youare mean two
oriented
right let try here
light coming okay
expensive demo
actually knocking half
light cuz half
unpolarized source half
polarized one way half polarized
way source
unpolarized put another
polarized source front
rotate eventually axis
polarization orthogonal
block 100 light
see perpendicular
completely orthogonal
perpendicular would say uh
rotate slightly
offaxis let light
thats polarization work thats
see glare
doesnt affect eye doesnt
hurt eye youre skiing
said um thats
instrument theyre looking
polarization optical light
microwave light big
bang leftover heat big
bang remember said inflation
inflation theory
quantum field fluctuated
produced everything know
love big bang would also
produce called gravitational
wave wave fabric spaceime
th wave would perturb
electron proton early hydrogen
atom universe cmbb
cosmic microwave background produced
400000 year big bang
light interacts matter
see glare becomes
polarized matter would polar
matter orientation would
change depending much
gravitational wave energy present
cmbb produced
actually gravitational wave detector
using photon cosmic
background type film
onto wave gravity
exist exist
get get polarization
curling twisting tw pattern
polarization called call b
mode polarization wow
lot logical step actually
well tested well
theorized hasnt detected
yet quality physic going
yeah thats super cool man
yeah literally use
cant use know cant use
iphone got cool detector
colleague suzanne stag
princeton uh shes built detector
operate 01 degree absolute
zero right using isotope helium
incredible stuff
theyre superconducting detector
theyre basically little thermometer
know go outside
new york san diego go
outside see sun
hand basically detect
sun using infrared
skin absorb infrared heat well
detector see
microwave infrared radiation
operate
really cold otherwise like
building know biggest
know james web space telescope
putting manhattan whats
fluctuation temperature
youre looking
universe cooled would
present uh right big
bang yeah exactly exactly
looking therell deviation
part billion
nanoelvin word
universe average 27 kelvin
would 27 plus nano kelvin
direction 27us 1 nano kel
youre looking nth decimal place
right billionth degree
billionthion degree wait
somebody gave money
wait wow here thats
insane let drive home need
inflation okay okay let
tell okay going
transition
okay direction 27 whats
give decimal place
2726 2726 degree
direction universe okay
look direction right
276 degree right
hell know
temperature
thousandth
degree room temperature
fluctuates degree exactly whole
degree corner corner
near lamp whole
universe thats right one
guth said
way get case
universe small talking
equilibrium temperature
equilibrium quickly expanded
right like fast couldnt go
equilibrium
marking
temperature bajillion year ago
thats cool hence justification
inflation yes yes
expansion give
uniformity across entire
expansion correct wow correct okay
im done need call
aquarius come back l2 he going
call steak oh god yeah
thats insane insane mean
literally mean think
like think like
god wow thats brilliant mean
thats thats thats really
inflation explains
needed cause inflation
pull as
basically mean
result related whats called
multiverse know basically without
multiverse dont get inflation
model according
thats cause people like there
phase transition right there phase
transition yeah actual
dynamic explained using
quantum field theory theory
everywhere space there quantum
field okay guy right
sound like episode star trek
next generation next generation
love phrase phase
transition let get
question come okay right
oh man got excited put
hello dr tyson dr heating uh
10yearold reuben sixyearold eli
harrisburg pa right
everything compacted one tiny
dot smaller speck dust
big bang uh indeed formed
dust around prior big
bang doesnt mean
another universe collapsed form
whats deal wish
uh young people would said
simple question
know b theyre basically asking
caused big caused universe
start expanding first place
mark good scientist
dont know dont know sure
alternative thats
say doesnt know something
mark good scientist
doesnt know thats right wife
sends grocery store
crappy scientist known
doesnt right okay well thats
call research know
phd mean known
field dont know
exactly perhaps
trying know answer full
community yes community
scientist specifically
simon observatory question
question simon observatory
part designed answer
sense stephen hawking used
say nonsensical ask
happened big bang
time came existence gonna say
said like asking whats north
north pole oh santa
claus right there got santa
claus reality
answer question affirmative
actually hinted could
universe existed
beforehand actually collapsed
used call big crunch
call bounce theyre actually
eminent theorist
earth including never like
crunch cuz implies brittle
make crackling sound
serial revenue delicious
anything word crunch
got good captain
punctuate
uh uh actual answer
trying determine happened
science cant prove
something happened like prove 1
plus 1 equal 2 1 1 equal two
tell mutual friend terrence uh
reality cant prove
physical fact falsify
alternative model see
twisting roing twisting pattern
polarization called curl mode b
mode falsify model
big crunch
previous existing universe
cyclical model prove
wrong uh getting data
see would
deathnell alternative model
would huge triumph
history cosmology okay dont
know answer okay next question
go right glad cleared
right uh
good good know floating
idea way tested
exactly rejected
thing conjecture anything
literally like thousand theorist
consistent fact
key thing
want prediction
postdiction exactly retro retro
good day gentleman matt
oklahoma burning question
origin universe
exactly trying gain looking
past help advance
population earth technological
standpoint solely
history book
well got feeling uh matt
little problem work
polite he really
questioning existence yeah thats
right yeah justify
taxpayer well um
dont mind actually want
ask guy step
matt uh whats
whats favorite day
calendar every year favorite
birthday birthday
neil like four cardinal point
okay calendar yeah okay
equinox
solstesses okay okay
know like like
four cardinal point like
jesus neil
like oh god actually
cuz long ive known he
person point day
like texting
day point like
day look forward day
thats he twitter
know thats time thats
thats correct go ahead uh
mentioned related
birthday
birthday people say
christmas anniversary kid
birthday whatever want uh
beginning like
idea firsthand
evidence happened
born chuck rely
people witness eyewitness
testimony well video oh god
dont want see
reincarnated
big crunch uh
people want know happened
came ultimate
history fulfills need u
like knowing history create
know excess gdp
part wellrounded educated
civilized society knowing
answer big question
make u different animal
people homo sapien mean
one wise one know
one wise wisdom
ask question perhaps
answer thats make u unique
different specie
okay listen im think existence
think think defended
well yeah okay right
well give go
matt give go
alan ryer say hello dr
tyson dr keing always wondered
cmb last frame
reference radio wave kick
say c rb
oo like let let preamble
saying radio wave one point
distant
past included would later called
microwave right microwave
simply small radio wave micro wave
theyre really like
centimeter radio wave even
longer uh historically
still radio wave since
word use small
radio wave call microwave okay
pick uh
go universe
make little box one cubic
centimeter okay inside box
mostly nothing might
maybe maybe know proton nutrino
mostly therell 419 photon
big bang
average wavelength 2
millimeter average there spread
black body 2 millimeter
wavelength time stretched
much much shorter wavelength inf uh
know
infrared optical
ultraviolet eventually
gammaray universe came
existence highly energetic wait dont
think
photon describe way
moving volume
recombination right oh yeah
know yeah think
yeah recom im think free photon
since thats temperature
think youre saying
okay extrapolate back
go free
photon yeah
scattering scattered photon okay
video recently
thats beautiful long take
photon get sun oh
yes okay tightly tightly coupled matter
radiation universe
expanding cooling eventually
get radio wave
know keep paying tax
thats going take billion year
universe go expand
factor 10
could take factor 10
time age universe
wavelength 10 time bigger
basically start calling
radio wave okay universe
10 time bigger
stretching universe exactly
thats cool answer yes
yeah yeah youre going see
buddy dont know want
spend money trademark
right
clarify cosmic
microwave background cosmic
visible background yeah infrared
infrared background cosmic
visible cosmic uh uh optical well
visible yeah ultraviolet
side cosmic xray
background gamay background
thats right yep go okay
love hey star talk fan dont
know know audio
version podcast actually post
week advance video version
get spotify apple
podcast podcast outlet
multiple way
ingest cosmic star talk
uh yog say hello lord
nice dr keing personal
astrophysicist love uh yoga
nagpur india question
cmbb anisotropy really random
may know anisotropy
mean isotropic right make
sense would
isnt isotropic ac
okay tell isotropy
yeah isotropy feature
complete uniformity thing
look
homogeneity similar position
every direction look way
point telesc youre ever
flying airplane youre
cloud go cloud go
cloud yeah cloud
look window
look perfectly isotropic anywhere
look window youre
brightness
bright kind look like youre
inside pingpong ball everything
brightness intensity
thats isotropic thats perfect
isotropy principle looking
everywhere anisotropy
mean fluctuation
amount
one sp one space youll see something
different look
space thats right
universe perfectly symmetric
earlier time amount matter
everywhere amount dark
matter everywhere
exotic particle everything exactly
identical universe would
way know form
cluster galaxy single galaxy
planet etc etc right
perfect isotropy isaac newton
realized 300 plus year ago
perfect isotropy incompatible
existence dont see
perfection wherever look
aspire also know
there clump dark matter
know know exactly exactly
kind whats called clump
matter clump matter
question asking
significant
basically related fact
formed region
excess dark matter
excess dark matter know
coagulate though thats inflation
come field quantum
field tiny fluctuation
theyre isotropic
either quantum physic enable
universe thats right quantum
fluctuation product
quantum inflation right
shouldnt presuppose
looking see
yeah pool dark matter
knew coagulate
fluctuation quantum field
fluctuation
disruption field
create something pop field
thats universe
one big field
according according
universe particular
instantiation condition
quantum field whats called
multiverse kid
universe right there
multiverse say
encompassing know
one star one planet there one
many many billion galaxy
could trillion infinite number
universe inhabit
inhabit multiverse
multiverse collection
point fourdimensional spaceime
maybe higher spacetime could ever
exist yeah
fluctuation greater space
youre absolutely right within
fluctuation like wave
ocean theyre wave upon wave upon
wave manifestation
infinite series wave train
perhaps date back big bang
chuck insulting
sound accuse someone
fluctuation actually quite
compliment
cosmically speaking look
right good question
couple right brandon
christian brandon christian say
hello dr tyson lord nice dr
kading brandon new
jersey question today
idea could possibly
side cmbb would
considered part universe
discover would
something else altogether ah okay
cmbb shell photon
fictitious shell
photon coming u
particular event mean
fictitious word show
send well
artificial um non there
place go cmbb
question asking
right cnb representative
event occurred event
first electron fused
first proton making
first atom hydrogen
happened universe became
transparent wave light
existing beforehand wave
photon free stream come
towards telescope come
direction moment
look back space youre looking back
time moment time
look like shell u look
see shell photon little
bit hotter little bit colder
average 2726° kelvin
absolute zero tiny
fluctuation beyond
mean earlier time yes
thing earlier time
pretty boring life
pretty boring 200 nearly
400000 year yeah
400000 year nothingness
except proton
neutron plasma forth
electron cosmic event
there place there
well universe glowing
different temperature exactly
plasma almost uniform
plasma okay expanding cooling
shifting waveling red shifting
wave go wow right
super cool 1701 cara say
greeting tennessee dr tyson
comrade nice got make
russian
cosmic query regarding higs
field current model higs
field evenly distributed could
area spaceime field
dense uhhuh thats great
question like could mean
giving different mass
particle
wouldnt wild thatd
messed universe though
mass
today yesterday right good
friend mine matt straler guy
wrote wonderful
book called wave
impossible sea
higs field im glad like
impossible word know love
thats youd surprised many book
word impossible higs
field thats
impressive people talk
higs bzon thats whats
fundamental higs bzon one
instantiation one creation moment
particular fluctuation field
called higsfield yes could vary
time time exciting
thing whats called
scalar field dont want get
technical there thats first
scalar field know
one thats postulated
known yet exist hope
know shed light
pun intended inflaton field
scalar field dont
called vector property
dont property
value like temperature room
scalar point every point
space there value know uh
30 degree celsius kind hot
know im talking get
even hotter point
number every point higs
field special case like
type field like firmians
quark type field
photon field
sort direction point
spaceime like gravitational
field value direction
want pull right
value exactly okay okay
yep care um
vary could connected
two higsfield infotton
would really exciting
would say particle field
responsible giving inertia
mass massive particle
existence coupled somehow
origin universe maybe
there connection
mass particle
ever initial phase
universe called inflation
something havent figured yet
mass look
pretty random yeah yeah
fundamental theory predicts
mass particle universe
exactly thats great question
right eric venus say yes
like planet
goddess say understand
look universe
looking back time
learned far early
universe expect impact
life earth near future
anything looking back
use looking forward um like
yeah um there lot
mystery still dont know
dont know first
galaxy formed nothingness
left cmb dont
know exactly went
transition called cosmic dark
age learn history
learn know actual
medieval dark age impact
decision make society
think learning
early universe evolved type
physic play yes
hinting uh
hint actually
bulk property universe
particularly dark energy evolving
need know need know
different past dark
energy uh different value
today hubble con
thought constant whole
universe later might
true changed past
could change future exactly
could involve property
spaceime called vacuum energy
universe
could lead know
different scenario end
universe everyone always talk
beginning big rip big
crunch dont know would happen
know say keep paying
tax could another
trillion year find
answer another fast bit
dramatic
answer came age
cataloges peculiar galaxy
called peculi didnt know
hell era
computing able simulate
must happened ordinary galaxy
make look like cuz theyre
colliding train wreck
learned
happened past create
catalog peculiar galaxy
say hey wait minute
headed towards andromeda going
one simulation
somebody else say hey dave right
future graduate future
future say hey look two
galaxy isnt
beautiful wow look didnt
always look like sombrero
many kardashians
milk drama okay one last one
matt nukem say hello dr tyson
dr keing lord nice name matt
nukem like duke nukem im san
diego california san diego thats
hometown mean current
hometown im curious simon
observatory ability detect new
particle know look
collect data
cheer fellow science educator
discover thing youre
looking thats side light
question predict serendipity
uh cnb discovered
accidentally werent looking
glow big bang uh
aftermath uh actually great
love simon
observatory thing
swinging fence
dont know inflation took place
see could hull
happened bicycle
international audience swing
fence baseball reference
mean youre swinging
deep home run might might
strike yeah swing
way might strike
connect way yeah
international listener think cricket
century thats oh thats
thatll even better look
um going cricket
century like um there
thing guaranteed happen
theyre guaranteed know
thats particle dark matter
know weve detected dark
matter there dark matter detection
called nutrino nutrino
every property dark matter
doesnt make enough socalled
know make universe flat
forth weve detected dark matter
however embarrassingly enough
shamefully enough physicist
17 elementary particle dont
know mass three 17
know mass exquisitly accurately
14 higs boson
electron etc dont know
dont know mass three type
nutrinos three nutrino flavor
lower bound
upper bound dont
measurement like someone looking
chuck saying oh youre
somewhere know uh 1 inch
tall 1000 ft tall like
interesting
true yeah true
useful thats beautiful way phrase
going go
take early
image dark matter
composition universe
affected effectively
weigh nutrino getting enough
together theyre light
theyre million time less massive
electron least could
even less sure constrain
property weigh
collecting
universe grand scale literally
