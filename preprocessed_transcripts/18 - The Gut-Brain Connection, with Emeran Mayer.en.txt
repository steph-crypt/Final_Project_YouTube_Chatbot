brain gut connection
surprisingly never really
identified brain gut connection
system gut
interconnected
gut like brain within
gut immune system
microbe also live gut
nervous system gut
communicate
time havent evolved
without microbe gut every
organism today cockroach
butterfly human microbiome
gut microbiome whoa think like
charge yeah uber
ride thats
music
star talk special edition
mean got gary oreilly gary hey
neil man im good
chuck always good man good
course right today
yeah im im checking
subject love okay right
gut brain connection ah people
brain gut
oh went philosophical straight away

episode okay weve
everybody life tell u theyve
gut feeling something gut
feeling yeah weve seen
people stress dive dont
say brain feeling
exactly weve seen people
stress dive fridge
weve seen people depressed

work gut
standalone system within body
right actually direct
gut brain connection
gut feeling may actually
fact fictional imagination

make sense right call
hangry dont dont im
hangry im hangry spoiler
pun coming uh obviously
food thought time
expert

u hayden planetarium right
office gentleman based ucla
emaran meyer yes think
said name correctly youre
medical doctor ucla youre
gastroenterenterologist lot
syllable say youre gut man
think like correct
scrabble winner youre also
neuroscientist hardly ever see
two phrase
brain gut well
increasingly maybe
right youre also author
book got
simple mind gut mind gut
connection mind gut connection
2016 harper collins
mind gut added word
immune connection immune connection
mind gut taking body
yeah right well see
take u note
say youre also documentary filmmaker
whats yeah
almost um didnt go medical school
fortunate um retired
businessman invited several time
accompany sound assistant
place new guinea um
orinino river yanomami um indian
formative experience wow
nice thing reconnect
back mean know first
year medical student idea
thing know today
people visited
lived yanomami
interesting group people
healthiest microbiome
planet really found
poop three time day
going well thats
thats getting like
exactly determine
healthiest body
digging poop forest
scientist gloria
dominguez married famous
gastroenterologist researcher
interest studying
microbe um people around
world call vanishing
microbe know losing microbe
went yanomami
elaborate analysis didnt
obviously took sample
um turned microbial
system people
diverse richest anybody
must thought crazy
poop lab
back dont know know place
new york get charged extra
finish resume
youre professor
department medicine physiology
psychiatry thats evidence
breadth brought
together study
guided career led
path starting gut
always interest
brain nervous system
point said necessary
know connect
department thats david
geffin school medicine ucla let
get started mhm
brain gut connection
understand timeline correctly
nobody really talking
book came oh really
wrote book youre
pioneer brain connection
surprise ive
struggled professional career
literally decade get concept
brain gut connection accepted
major factor
epiphenomenon major disease
factor like inflammatory bowel
disease irritable bowel syndrome
many call functional
gastrointestinal ibs guess
hear time yeah tv
commercial um like
kind amazing enthusiasm
gradually developed book
first year really popular
first year gradually
picked go go
online mean every second word gut
health bra hear
time cursory fashion
know there lot indepth
talk gut
well mean gut would say
brain complex organ
body okay
digest tube know
mouse anus
long time digestion uh absorption
storage waste sort
main focus interest
meantime know know 70
immune system embedded
gut big portion hor hormonal
system endocrine system embedded
gut there separate nervous
system gut called
little brain mike gerson new
york colombia sort pioneer
uh describing popularizing
concept wait wait people
literally brain as
youre saying
yes know probably dont know
person know theyre like
yeah yeah sort
ramp answer
system gut interconnected
okay gut
like brain who talking
brain talking gut
gut talking brain first
within gut immune system
um know microbe also
live gut nervous system
gut communicate
time dont
know know right
could look inside right
lens know would see
thing interacting talking
add brain um
thing there
birectional communication going 247
even sleep always anything
happens brain level said earlier
mirror image gut
dont see see face
youre angry see
face see gut
contracting youre angry also
lot thing go
gut generate emotional feeling um
95 doesnt become conscious
thats thing
receptor transmitter
say
activated working im
obviously emailing
clarify said
conscious mean understand
mean feeling
wont know youll
act feeling
mind gut connection controlling
mean behavior thats
commanded microbe
need microscope see yeah
want say lot people
theyre aware know
theyre oblivious
body urge right yeah
yeah like sensation
everybody know uh satiation hunger
satiation absolutely
basic gut feeling people
funny say
younger mother used
say would eat id say im
still hungry would say
wait 10 minute stomach
talk brain let know
youre hungry well catch
yeah brain catch
stomach dont think dont
know got damn
thats case yeah lot
people lost mechanism
know like big part obesity
signal come
gut glp1 molecule
everybody talk everybody talk
produced cell gut
go hypothalamus
brain tell brain stop
eating youre full lot
people lost mechanism
feedback um
clear
mega dos hormone right
100 time higher gut
produce glp1 injection
everybody see tv right
give sensation
know glp1 excuse got
pharmacist sitting among u
cant help every tv
channel thats true way
think lost 20 pound
youre saying didnt know
chemical see
advertised 100 time day yeah
molecule heightened create
sensation really body
producing along
yeah uh lot thing
dont know many
sudden know seems
effective substance use disorder
people take find urged
drink people alcohol
abuse problem stop abusing alcohol
theyre like yeah didnt want
drink know know
kind ironic first
came la research student
studied hormone
know also
sibling called gip there
another medication
time didnt know
excited find substance
gut nobody clue
took really literally 35 year
40 year know got
bunch question want
establish something
received emerged idea
brain gut
connected way one understood
previously understand
medical school study brain
study brain study gut
study gut there siloing
body bit
piece assembled one thing
absolutely idea there
connection require somebody
mix interest one
aspect human physiology yeah
would say know ive
longstanding interest college
psychology know read
stuff yungian stuff uh came
medical school already
background know brain
science perspective yeah yeah
perspective would
actually say main reason
ended medical school thought
going go psychiatry
spending month
psychiatry rotation convinced
want
people okay never mind okay
might today might today
psychiatry moved lot
really yeah
openminded um charismatic uh
mentor really supported
know beginning yeah
interested isolating
molecule like glp1 necessarily
brain said combine
know brain
openminded um unusual
colleague either ignored
didnt find interesting
like ibs field
example like really
entrenched interest people say
ibs gut disorder right forget
brain know
counterintuitive fact
kid learn
hipbone connected simple
bone connected
like would think would
know gut bone connected
brain would make perfect sense
right first thing learn
learn anatomy
day
one go
think know med western
medicine successful obviously
many aspect based
reductionistic view body
interconnected system biological
gradually changing
there couple development like
there entity called functional
medicine nonscientific entity also
science there
scientist think system
interconnectivity system
itll take another 10 year
think
change mean theyll catch
spoke gop1
youve got cortisol serotonin yes
stress suppose love eating
experience eat certain
food maybe youll tell yes
serotonin released
gut dopamine cult like
say youre diving fridge
youre stress youre
going sugar fat
whatever mean long
take u work
weve got image person
broke yeah
loved one gallon ice cream
watching sad movie cry whats
thats sad movie
gut like hogenas ice cream
ice cream yeah
there smart people
worked area surprisingly
never really identified
brain gut connection know
always talked appetite uh
stress substance use disorder
never really became sort
essential part thats really
started know knew
thing quite time
good scientific study support
really become specialty
know dominant
paradigm think
going back chuck uh insight
anatomy
kneebone connected
several thing connected
brain bone gut
connected autonomic system
vagus nerve spelled
e vagus nerve
weve heard
couldnt tell actually
body right
yeah vega nerve okay
clavicle neck run
telling
good doctor right
doc tell u wheres vega
nerve
said exactly
yeah vega nerve first
birectional pathway
know like birectional freeway
okay traffic go
gut brain brain stem
higher emotional center 10
go way um example
stimulate acid production
stomach thats veagal phenomenon
thats people used cut
vagus nerve ulcer disease
dominant wow wow
amazing think
like 30 year ago
absolutely understanding cutting
foot ingrown
toenail exactly thats insane wait
body vagus
nerve go brain
stem okay neck um
like sound like chuck
knight said chuck say
90 second ago
tell okay
whats important realize
vega nerve branch
organ monitor every organ function
seven 247 one gut
received lot attention
always wondering 90
traffic going gut brain
there much happening
brain need know know
there receptor vagus
nerve serotonin
glp1 gip
disproportionate call afrant
sensory signal brain related
complexity go
gut signal
get microbe
processing hub yeah yeah im still
confused relate
immune system immune system
told 70 located
gut sandwiched layer
seven zero 70 zero wow sandwiched
layer gut
close communication microbe
gut micron away know
nature could engineer something like
thats potentially deadly
influence micro micron
millionth inch mean millionth
meter guess meter
right would thousandth
millimeter yeah would micron
yeah yeah immune system
close vagus sensor
nerve go immune
system gut pick
signal immune system
produce like cytoines example best
studied kind
effect behavior know like
cytoines um fatigue chronic pain
oh yeah well got come
pause
urge people
clean
colon uh cleanse cleanse
urge get oh im gonna
answer doctor
people prepping colonoscopy
theyre cleaning everything
microbe set shop
communicate brain
flow body benefit
one colleague look
butt okay destroying
hardearned ed microbiome every
time get ready um oh chuck
answer whats answer dr chuck
okay here answer uh
cleanse thats thats
first human yeah im
saying actual cleanse
mean know supposed get rid
stuff joke oh im
sorry wasnt good joke oh
thought saying like okay
never mind said
said said human
see missed cuz would
laughed cuz thats funny
excuse im sorry missed
colonoscopy thats look
intestinal lining good
stuff thats need
wall intestinal lining
cleaning look
youre getting rid okay
yeah two answer side
first one would contradict
said oh think real
well know aruveetic medicine
thousand year propagated
colonic cleanses right
benefit
let everything read say
benefit negligible
best okay unless wait would
health benefit suppose
feel better doesnt count mean
know doesnt talking
feel better punch
puppy make im sorry
say loud okay yes anyway
tell tell
good get arrested
long time dominated
driven motivated concept
cleansing human obsessed
cleansing know
spend lot money cleansing
cleansing colon
cleansing diet 19th century
europe modern time yes
cleansing become popular
talking ancestor
know need need dig
take bath year
necessary yeah birthday
got celebrate
okay microbiome
science um there certain potential
explanation people
thousand year well
reestablishes balance
within know within colonic
microbiome okay studied
scientifically certainly
youre saying feasible though
even though even though
dont empirical scientific
peerreviewed study feasible
concept could case
conceivable
blueprint microbiome doesnt
disappear cleanse
population blueprint
body
reconstruct okay jump
start jump start jump start
right fine changed mind
stripping stripping layer
paint reevolves
bring new layer paint
nice shiny microbe
important gut
evolution wed got rid
like sleep never
vulnerable asleep
right yet weve evolved
without sleep havent evolved
without microbe gut
come theyre
ogs theyre original life form
planet theyve 4
billion year know three
half billion cant get og
sure three half billion
people original gut know nicely
done thank
successful evolutionary development
every organism today
cockroach butterfly human
microbiome gut microbiome wow
there complex
there number calculated
freak people go
large intestine take one
centimeter slice one
centimeter one centimeter thats
410en inch
american american america thats
right dont bring metric
crap talking america
boy better talk inch
know talking millimeter
centimeter 410en inch
life work microbe
total number human ever
born
wow think like
charge yeah
darkened anorobic vessel fecal matter
microbe uber ride thats
uber ride
microscopic organism microbe
yeah read something recently
book one favorite scientific
author antonio damasio um
comparison early life form
know lot
intelligence mean microbe
planet must phenomenal amount
intelligence collected three
half billion year couldnt
long division
yeah mean dont
mind obviously
live homeostasis
world main benefit
connect
brain influence much
conscious entity mean
mind weve got
original gut microbe ogs
like refer three half
billion year theyve invented
language theyve got theyve
alphabet sort
communicating u
little hideyhole gut
know million gene
compared know meek number
1000ands gene stored
information build
molecule use
language basically stored
genome history
three
three
swear got b billion
billion okay
settled first microbe settled
floating tube uh first
know marine animal interacted
floating tube there
something called lateral gene transfer
transferred
gene language
animal know fast
forward first version
socalled little brain
gut interic nervous system
animal developing head
becoming polar organism
information language
transferred brain
polar organism head
opposite end whatever okay
okay yeah language ability
think come us building
block microbe developed
billion year mean
one fascinating idea
incredibly fascinating seeing
gut brain connection seeing
microbe way
communicating u super
highway used psychedelics
ingesting yet
everythings going
brain mh much
gut sort exploration
lot thing going
gut dont know yet like
serotonin play big role
know psychedelic
experience activating particular
serotonin receptor 5h2a receptor
brain
psychedelic experience seem many
seem related receptor
brain receptor
also gut microbe
dont know effect um
actually one cant
accident right accident
coevolutionary
thing right okay mind
desperate try expand thats
active find something
like psychedelics
whiz brain yeah mean
human probably used psychedelics
long long time long long time
based experience initially
accident ingested
mushroom sudden sort world
sort talk
evolution accident
eating mushroom sort
beginning stoned ape theory
evolution phrase stoned ape yeah yeah
okay stoned ape
mean ive zoo ive never
seen know ape
would love would love sit
watch chimpanzeee tripping
ball would love
havent pleasure seeing
well wild im guessing
theyll stumble across mushroom
curious eat go whoa
isnt basis gary coming
receptor
psychedelics unless
purview microbiome delighted
yeah thats really interesting
question cant really answer
say partially based
personal experience guess say
even though know
im recommending
people im recommending
right good doctor
cant im letting know
everybody psychedelics mean
cant legal medical legal
reason sue please
experience know
everybody say
universal human experience
one person get
realization interconnectedness
environment
planet like get totally
different paradigm oh yes chuck
oh god yes missed show
back
traveled costa rica iawaska
entire week wow uh tell
changed entire life
changed perspective everything
get funnier
know
one uh one
uh transmeditative state uh mother ya
came said cant help
funny son im sorry
okay clear
fully supervised oh god
yeah activity know
licensed theyre fully supervised
medical staff hand
wasnt somebody sold
street nobody back way
recommend say
please find professional
somebody supervise make sure
there medical staff hand
go somebody house okay
go dude ponytail
who like dude ive
shaman like long would
love turn universe
yeah doesnt ponytail
okay party
drug yeah youre
looking get high dont
kind high right yeah
yeah like one speculation
mean partially based
self experience there different
phase psychedelic experience
there initial know
rush get lot
visual auditory experience
longlasting effect mean
least 24 hour notice
pay attention ability
communicate talk youve
never talked like
emotion
even past one experience lot
people say one experience like
said lifechanging
effect youre going
look world differently
thats easy understand knowing
interferes brain neurosynapses
connect back gut
well slow effect know mean
thing happens
brain initially fast response
absorbed small intestine
oh ingest yeah
ingest got get
get brain
microbiome allows right
true part
absorbed small intestine
happens immediately ingestion
part go
colon longerlasting
effect would surprised
theyre mediated microbial know
add thing
stimulate 5hda 2a receptor
produce molecule
create longterm experience
right given there
connection there many
psychological
feature human behavior good
bad failure
psychological profile neurological
disease sort thing much
blame micro biome
current knowledge pretty much
based call association
study correlation take big
population people
particular diagnosis look
gut microbiome
different even know
part study right
doesnt prove causality thats
thing give example
think uh anxiety
opinion ive studied
pretty intensely first part
career know many mechanism
brain know effect
early life adversity predispose
greater anxiety know
much brain mechanism
people try propose know
microbe cause anxiety
research gone diet
relation alzheimers development
yes part big um u
european consortium alzheimer disease
funded nih there definitely
pretty strong evidence nih
national institute national institute
health said thank god
thank god yeah well thank
god time
time let tell
something sound like flavor
flight yeah
would say there there pretty
solid evidence call
dispiosis altered composition
gut microbiome play role
may heterogeneity know
ultimacy one disease maybe
different pathway
diet know become
sort magic word systemic immune
activation systemic inflammation
clearly one main risk factor
alzheimers also
one like parkinson um
alzheimers also
interesting anything preventive
chronic disease want
go whats referred
antiinflammatory diet basically thats
emergent awareness health yeah
butyrate
antiinflammatory phen yeah
butyrate polyphenols sort
thing large planted
alzheimers severe
symptom there evidence
ketogenic diet know
good diet average person
starves microbe
case beneficial there
one disease entity refractory seizure
young child ketogenic diet
also god ketogenic basically
protein time fat protein fat
protein keeping body
ketosis state keto right right
mean dont access
sugar carbohydrate
body basically us fat yeah
course presumably
agrarian ancestor ate
dead animal right berry
course could find
uh caveman diet
correct well know going
back personal experience
caveman
say
hanging
hanging didnt living
yanomami afarinoa river mean
theyre surrounded animal
know bird fish big
mammal eat small
amount animal product
mainly eat tuber berry
plantbased stuff thats
healthy microbiome thats
healthy microbi
studied way colleague
mine ucla ela sha way
production neurotrans gaba
inhibitory neurotransmitter
brain ketogenic diet thats sort
like valium know sort tuned
tone nervous system
much u really knowing lot
much u
beginning understand know youve
research decade
much
know yet look forward
yeah think scratching
surface surface oh really yeah
think well think
million gene microbe
know
gene aint right
yeah around little bit longer
collection gene
represented diversity microbe
youre referring million
gene okay someone prepping
colonoscopy got rid
entire population microbe
value exam
prevent colon cancer get
back microbiome
toilet come back fairly quickly
know would say wheres
recipe wait who oh
blueprint reassemble
gun inside dont im asking
medical doctor well im
telling
ask two
got anyway
yeah need know okay
youre saying chemically
equipped reproduce
microbiome suitable u
there form colitis
serious form antibiotic
basically destroy microbiome
yeah um oh antibiotic
getting rid whatever
condition biotics
killing everything called
cedhicial colitis thats thats
one therapy
effective feal micro transplant
disease work
poop transplant poop
transplant whose poop
taking oh ask uh ill
tell dog poop
there people
identified donor free
disease family history disease
diverse healthy
microbiome donor
one effective therapy
get one transplant
poop transplant
person got
transplant microbial composition
donor yes
didnt look
like week later
month later person
microbiome reassembled
reason possible
microbe floating inside
lumen inside gut
also inhabit mucosal lining
thats probably
information stored blueprint
thats exactly come back
yeah say earlier thats
okay
thats know dont need
right need funny
youre right funny guess
right advertisement
gut ailment every time see one
say could happen
one show lot
ibs irritable bowel syndrome
know cause gut
health fix yeah yeah
something group
studied know like would say
four four decade youre failing badly
people still get back
work well
fortunately finally 30 year
know writing article review
article basically called
disorder altered gut brain
interaction bring brain
finally
effective therapy brain targeted
therapy meaning simple relaxation
technique mindfulnessbased stress
reduction gut directed hypnosis
cognitive behavioral therapy theyre
better effective
medication he getting newagy
received
quote western medicine yeah
lot resistance also
pharmaceutical industry course
need pill need pill need
pill yeah
cant meditate pill youve
got mean getting inundated
supplement getting inundated
probiotic mean probiotic
there know eat
yogurt cuz got
basillus active microbe
really need official
organization gastronology
published know always publish
statement uh expert
statement said there
good enough scientific evidence
actually recommend probiotic general
treatment ibs however
patient know benefit
there also there different type
probiotic go internet
know yeah yeah whole
industry yeah thats whole
industry like wrote book
somebody came retired um
ulip packard engineer said
want partner want start
probiotic company go
big warehouse get
organism package
know market thats
lot people said
he billionaire
youre saying seen since
dont know right
there lot table right
inundated ad
telling u one thing another
medicine put forth
would say best practice going
forward youre prescribing
audience surely diverse
kind thing aware
put food pie hole
love glimpse
diet
dont judge cuz like pie
first would say
food know lifestyle
food big part
lifestyle mediterranean
diet never longer call
mediterranean diet
mediterranean lifestyle go
italy summer experience
social interaction uh
big part know
like go
back around go back
soil plant come
animal eat come
food chain u yeah like
awareness gut
health may optimal key
start realize
eat
grown grown
eat context
know thats easy say
suppose dont care
poop regularly
worried
dont mood swing dont
ibs make rare
spectrum gut biome issue
seems right know
sudden since become acceptable
topic dinner party
case even 10 year
ago seems like everybody
know like 40 60
population kind poor gut
health know im sure thats
true wait people
studied said best
gut health world
manifest fact
live longer never
diarrhea constipation
metric arrive
conclusion know people
um
thats youre saying
lived would realize
cant cant go back know
there there way there
cable there streaming im

without medication
medication medication
medical system medical system
impressive medical
insurance anything dont need
well dont either
let honest america
healthcare right
illusion people dont get mad
vote differently okay right
youve spoken mixture
traditional western medicine
lifestyle diet uh even sort
eastern philosophy way living
way sift fact
fiction someone who exposed
ad youtube
video someone seeking guidance
inundated
misinformation thank
difficult average
person difficult especially
today medium climate going
get worse know political
reason think going listen
dont blame im healthy
doctor said
best health anybody could ever
know know healthy
yeah one mission
stage career really
provide answer people
trust transparency think
always always
evidence supported
evidence could come scientific
study high quality know five
mouse claim
also come um traditional
success develop
criterion somebody stuck around
five six thousand year there got
something know
cannot cannot dismiss
turmeric good example true
antiinflammatory there
scientific study jinseng another
there there several thing
think there obviously
middle
enormous number stuff thats placebo
placebo bad thing
people feel better want
spend money people poo poo
shouldnt use phrase know
people denigrate placeos
work study placeos yeah
there lot know high
high quality research place
brain mechanism gut brain
connection placebo brain
perceives working yeah
placebo
evidencebased therapy body
know
enemy pharmaceutical industry
obviously thats badmouth
wonderful thing youre
really good doctor healer
utilize placebo response
extensively
interesting isnt thats
pretty wild man yeah doctor
brings new york city
wasnt show u
invitation um
integrative health symposium thats
going uh
tomorrow saturday
couple one panel ibs
one talk um increased
stress responsiveness people okay
especially stress buzz word
killer late yeah
stressed well cortisol stress
uh inadvertably linked well
welcome town yeah uh thanks
making time schedule
speaking gut biome dont eat
dirty dog okay hot dog yeah man
oh need yeah
know got guy
got live see people
eat every day oh theyre theyre
itll kill
okay yeah built resistance

go one dirtiest
fingernail thats thats
best one thats guy dont look
like thanks neil team
pleasure pleasure
u sir guy amazing
team know weve done lot podcast
there many
like dr emmeran mayor 2016
book mind gut connection followed
six year later mind gut immune
immune connection nice right
gary thanks
pleasure right chuck
stomach hurt
laughter
well go talk gut see see
happens gut feeling
fine good know thank
star talk special edition neil
