life form pristine
planet first question
would ask exploratory human first
let say go old episode
twilight zone called invader
episode agnes morhead lone
ranch woman little house
prairie watch
called invader point
im life form see
human first question would
come colonize
planet cuz thats goal thats
happening okay
music
star talk neil degrasse tyson
personal astrophysicist
going cosmic query today
except today
paul mccurio paul whats friend
welcome back star talk great see
whatd chuck
uh know he
bag somewhere he he last time
chuck breathing still
still breathing man
im good im good miss miss
still late show

love havent seen
dont know answer ill
say dont know yeah oh
know always answer okay
go eric
krajidoti dr tyson duke mccuria
wow ive never called duke
oh cuz oh cuz chuck called
lord oh lord nice oh didnt oh
okay okay well everybodys got
title im duke go
hope matt home wife
duke earl
duke earl right go
lower duke duke yo
going 30
minute duke
got come high give
falsetto
well find youre dook
well come something right
go greeting mangahila
pennsylvania regarding idea time
travel star position hypothetically
create time machine
attempt go back mangahila 2000
year ago would end empty
space entire solar system
would arrived location
departed would
departed every time machine
also space machine theyre spacetime
machine dont say
relevant
matter
got around back
future marty trying
escape libyan terrorist
jump delorean he
quickly typing date type 1955
day year
leaf go back
1955 earth part
orbit date around sun
date date date
skirted
cant true hang
dodged bullet little
bit okay 6 month earlier
later plopped
vacuum space hed dead okay
reason dodged
bullet entire solar
system also orbiting center
galaxy happened pick
exact date key
well moving coordinate
system solar system okay
whole solar system
moving go back 30 year he
leaving solar system
today moved
time would solar system
today 30 year ago also
would well ahead solar
system would gotten soul would
need another 30 year catch
also moved space point
time landed
exactly spot earth
implicit storytelling
youre absolutely right nothing
cant way make
sense wait solar system
formed 46 six billion year ago
isnt premise part question
false premise would
end entire solar system
would arrived location
solar system location
rotating
galaxy milky way rotating
star
milky way rotating around
central black hole center
go back time go back
time longer left
space youll dropped
middle nowhere always
land spacetime coordinate
future sort
without relativity part youre
going visit mar dont aim
mar aim mar
get
intersect mar youre going back
2000 year empty well
there going home depot cuz
existed subway sandwich shop
theyve around
mall yeah well mean know
franchising methodology
brilliant never get enough
credit need
know solar system
earth 2000 year ago
move back time move back
location cannot say
manga would manga 2000
year ago wouldnt would
exactly today
mangahila sound like native native
tribe thats would
2000 year ago he asking
create time machine go back
mangahila would end
empty space yes would unless
moved time thats ive spend 10
minute describing understand
answer answered
question yes yes unless also
move back space base well
correct got okay yes every
time machine also space machine
otherwise would quite
lethal time would
happen get dropped
middle space cuz everythings moving
got move action okay
marggo lane mhm life
form pristine planet watching
exploratory human arrive first
time okay youre observing human
arrive first time yes
first question youd ask
assuming could understand
answer
question would really needed
sketcher shoe dont
bend put thats
bet saw tv
commercial forget
thats specie
there lot question
kardashians really whats
right people
make vaseline make money think
ive tub
vaseline vaseline handed
grandfather dont
think understand conceptual
okay go think
people used use vaseline
lotion big use grease
brake car still
giant bat tub vaseline
know could go
30000 bag garbage youre going
find one empty container
right life form
pristine planet watching exploratory
human arrive first
question would ask exploratory
human okay first let say
look online maybe pluto tv
one thing old tv
tv tv yeah there
several others well go old
episode twilight zone called
invader thats say well
watch lot twilight zone im trying
remember one uh
episode agnes morehead
lone ranch woman little house
prairie whole one
woman show shes character
watch
called invader oh remember
called invader
dont say anything point
im life form see
human first question would
given know human
come colonize
planet cuz thats goal thats
happening okay
let happen okay weve
seen happens colonize
stuff okay uh thats
first point
second thats interesting
implies human
technology alien
case yeah otherwise alien
would visited u first thats
youre jumping conclusion
wow youre missing question
got ask really conveyed
happiness little yellow circle
smiley face called emoji like
many bigger question
could ask people yeah
colonization good point
nothing good ever really happened
good
would say survive
wouldnt enough right come
visit another planet thats maybe
would would hiding
behind something say
feel brother
know got ask black
question cuz know cuz theyre
thing maybe say
part oh
see yeah part
demographic well see
goostepping toward
probably know youre jew black
person h may want let
pas gypsy catholic
catholic pretty much anybody yeah
yeah anyone non aryan wouldnt ask
got though
seriously technology
got u assume would see
land something
youd want learn scientist
would compare note yeah would
thing there certain thing
common u even
dont otherwise speak thing
call tang like kind thing
would know though thats
im saying dont know tang
kardashians slipon sketcher
dont dont unless show
drinking tang ruin every
joke party stupid logic
kardashian underarm slipon
sketcher could ask whats
cant presume
life form smarter
ability see weve
here would say want
know want compare science note
science transcends time
space way culture
doesnt transcend instagram got
big following matter
id verify see
wavelength light
see could completely
different sens well going
think say medically youd probably want
check right
first dont mean poking
body first didnt mean
way im talking
like anal probe anything im
saying thought dont
give alien bad name im
saying wouldnt want
check mind compare note
term science wouldnt physic
would physically want understand
body versus visa v vessel
vessel ser
biologist yes im physicist
compare pull periodic table
element mhm
organization universal anyone
know element well enough well
would organize way
okay somebody landed
like write creative writing
major didnt care science
first emissary another
planet im pretty sure would
given science yeah youre
science snob oh
one everybody care hello
neil paul julian atlanta
native writing downtown manhattan
question relates star black
hole understand sun belongs
third generation star since
big bang star eventually
die explosion
form black hole ending eternal
singularity mass
possible distant future
black hole
star since lifespan much
longer star could
passage time create population
black hole outlive nearly
replace star yes next question okay
turn according
stephen hawking black hole actually
evaporate slowly
burnout evaporate
different different yeah
wouldnt burn
slowly there point
star burn leave
corps corps
black hole come time
black hole black hole
outnumber living star
never outnumber corps isnt
black hole like like
alice brady bunch giant
vacuum cleaner like sucking
star whether evaporate
dont alice brady
bunch yeah housekeeper
would vacuum
black hole
yeah im sorry cant connect im
sorry see alice
grid nine square
center center
notice image kept uh repeating
back forth didnt
technology pretty short
loop right got annoyed
thing mad mad mad
mad world yeah um saw last
night really im serious okay
know every movie okay
there shot end spencer
tracy hanging edge uh
slide cable go
window sitting great
dne licking face yes thats
repeat keep
repeat annoying
well
dont know got
like he
eye move way um
possible already black
hole star un
universe know
progenitor black hole
star thats made one
10000 star one million star
massive star
black hole volume gas
creates star creates lot
low mass star fewer middle mass
star high mass star
like cosmic game
hideandseek called
initial mass function specifically
initial mass function favor low
mass star high mass star
rare rare dont know latest
iteration initial mass function
least rare one
thousand star
massive enough make black hole
end life im saying
star today born
pocket gas still
alive thriving would
one two black hole black
hole outnumber star
way outnumber star
trillion year trillion year
lowest mass star burn
fuel sound like star
need like support group black
hole way get dealt
theyll fine black hole need
support black hole
develop jeopardy
avoid thats well
emotionally
relationship people
whats relevant yeah need
map black hole
step around
especially time machine
dont want time machine land
black hole didnt type
right spacetime coordinate
right let move think
answered thoroughly mhm cesar
fredik bogota columbia love
uh speed light c shape reality
fundamental property however
intriguing consider
regardless unit used c could
potentially half double
value could suggest factor
possibility
imposed constraint within
simulation might determine
seemingly arbitrary value
universal constant understand
wow here couple speed life
fact
299792 440 meterss
yes yes know c
come latin word speed c
stand constant yeah
think there speculation
1922 uh historian scientist
celitrius latin
speed thats first ive heard
well thats im open
horizon thats first ive
heard true first ive
heard doesnt mean
fundamental
constant universe right
word constant begin c
understand there im
wrong id intrigued learn
thats really going okay
theact
suggestion okay unit
arbitrary completely
arbitrary said youre tall
59 mhm measured height
unit
59ness tall
unit number unit 59
new unit thats 59 im one
unit youre one
okay point doesnt
make shorter taller anything
point im saying unit
arbitrary speed
measuring real
fundamental unit dont matter
precisely understand speed
light measured
precisely defines length
meter thats well know speed
light get another point
precision measurement
speed light affect
definition length meter
v vary well
point still
uncertain thats correct
amazing fundamental thing
inherent cannot
inherent uncertainty around
speed light youre saying
whatever uncertainty
smaller capacity measure
know
uncertainty cant measure
always uncertainty every
measurement know
always know say
tall 59 59
quarter 58 34
58 78 59 18
59 116th come gave
unit inch youve
approximated havent well
depends sock im wearing
approximated measure
59 let say youre exactly 59
59 even mean
thickness line thats nine
inch five
foot within thickness
line right 58
9900s inch 59 1
1000th inch youre saying
exactitude impossible correct
always everywhere never measure
something exactly
spa spacetime continuum
theyre whats called measurement
error theyre error theyre
measurement
uncertainty 58
youre later 510
point life
exactly 59
could never measured
right could
measure bracket according
uncertainty measuring
device right im exactly 59
felt little vibration little
vibration measurement never
exact never
never thats correct
know greater precision
youre tall tallest 62
youre shrinking yeah im probably
shrinking spine
collapsing disc
spine column fluid yeah
go space grow inch
space suit walk
spacew walk made taller
one took
growing gravity gravity
longer squashing atom
getting stretched yeah molecule
stretch right im probably 61
34 id guess
say science tall drink water
right go doesnt mean
great affection
know bound
boundless right stephan summer
uh steph h kansa
making way old small
town love yeah making way
old query found one
talked could
pas wormhole gravity
would well understanding
gravity warping space
since wormhole making hole
dimension space would
warped side
furthermore wormhole literal
hole dimension would
able pas even perceive
uh being live within
threedimensional space
wow want sound like
want write another sequel
say want repeat anything
want write
sequel interstellar thats
he trying thats exactly
wormhole us make
one us negative gravity know
make wormhole dont
sub stuff substance
make happen gravity collapse
spaceime negative gravity
could negative matter would pry open
spaceime creates shortcut
principle
able position
way pop hole fabric
space time step
youre instantly side
way would rendered
transporter completely obsolete star
trek think step
wormhole get planet
yeah there guarantee youre
going get without getting
lost like google map take
right suddenly youre
corn field ill take chance
dont pay attention
google map ill take chance
dematerializing body energy
rematerializing back matter
side think
thats po like
nose end cheek anything
anything thought memory
stored synapsis brain
dont know whats going
maybe could help let say
misplace key time
suddenly thing rearranged know
time thats possibility
brain complex im
guessing dematerialize
rematerialize chance youll
mess rather improve okay
3d wormhole
another dimension even know
like trying change
flat knowing car
see part wormhole
intersects dimensionality
part wormhole well
here example gave another
show uh live flat sheet
paper standing
around see dot appear
nowhere dot becomes small
circle big circle
watching okay shrink
back becomes dot
disappears thatd freaky thats
called vega act magi
magician work completely
freaky bellagio
witnessed threedimensional sphere
passing two dimension
world described
point circle grew
circle wide diameter
sphere went back
disappeared passed
side higher dimensional
thing passing
dimensionality manifest way
another answering
question answer uh
wormhole literal hole
dimension able pas
even perceive
being live uh within three
dimension yeah perceive
would see part wormhole
intersected dimensionality
nothing wont
appreciate else going
fact move
fourth dimension youre going
catch youre passing
wormhole
youre going instantly get
side instantly
instantly movie like showing
youre going tunnel
know like water
park correctly done
rick morty
exactly watch rick
morty science knowledge
dude whats name doctor strange
know im talking he
would superpower
would want able
sophisticated understated
trying hard
like yeah yeah mean prefer
rick morty wormhole rick
us real science
wormhole
rick morty thats accurate
us real science whereas
doctor strange us magic
cant perceive wormhole arent
way like walking life
like tourist loss new york
city looking taking picture
everything yes isnt way
science sort make u
feel way
deal cant become
scientist unless comfortable
steeped ignorance okay
constant debate
like try get
lazy trying get stuff right
want get stuff right oh
better know anything right
let go bottle wine
learn love question
oh god went law school
dont need aida answer freaking
question know talking
science like looking
picasso youre like whoa
nose calf dont know
historian art
historian theory theyre
completely full know okay
know youre fired
science dont think ever put
nose calf yes
right go oh captain
carl two k everybody ohoy
captain carl st thomas u virgin
island ive often wondered
photographer physic enthusiast
colorful world result
white star white made
color planet planet
orbiting blue red star would
world different shade red
blue way want thank
neil shout comedic
sidekick uh would would world
different shade red blue
orbiting blue red star
current eye yes evolved
there reason
evolutionary path wouldnt taken
divided blue light
different subcategories yeah
pure red entire earth
going feel like brothel yeah
however dont pretend dont know
width
sensitivity light much greater
single band light say
lost right
roy g
biv know roy g biv dont
know roy red orange yellow green
blue indigo violet roy g biv okay
never knew never
got learn something every
day yeah thats im
okay okay roy g biv see
color make color
photo hubble james webb
telescope infrared part
spectrum cant see color
infrared part spectrum
know take
rgb slap
onto different wavelength
infrared part spectrum create
color photograph thats
would see site
shifted infrared part
spectrum world would look
like infrared part
spectrum neutral color
cant detect
evolved see there reason
think brain wouldnt assign color
thats whats going
assigning color fact richard
dawkins evolutionary biologist
think bat actually
echolocate see color
mammal brain capacity
use youre using
echolocation
tag color orbited
orbited blue star wed still
would still clear sky
word every eye
evolved star transport
u blue star right would
see color blue
see color visible part
spectrum therell blue
ultra violet ultraviolet see
color visible part
spectrum however fake
authentically fake thats called
perfect instagram filter right
going direction
violet take three band violet
light adjacent one another
assign
rgb bring back together
reconstruct would see
sensitivity shifted
violet ultraviolet part
spectrum blue part
spectrum think
shifted color
limited much ability
shift limited well
im
see red violet thats
thats want see color
anywhere else take rgb
slap three different band
come color picture xrays
infrared ultraviolet gamma
ray red
planet blue planet red star
blue star star
color ability see
without sort slapping rb
technique
rbg roy say roy g bib roy g bib
way evolved cant
cant see way
band visible light
narrow compared ultraviolet
infrared narrow
practically blind matter
insect see deep
ultraviolet insect theyre
perfectly happy stare
bright light cant see
second whats happening thats
different thing burn
stimulate retinal cell
recover yeah
take several second yeah yeah
yeah
always fun way
youve drinking uh right
another question hello im john may
huoi uh may hoy mayoy go
uh parkland florida know
cosmic microwave background
like snapshot early universe
temperature dropping
ever since im wondering could
temperature used kind
universal clock could measure
super accurately would tell u
exactly old universe right
would age
matter
universe
yes every part universe
place time
138 billion year
ago oldest thing
universe every direction look
exactly age traceable
period time yeah everything
moment see past
ask thing
well even farther away u
think diameter
universe big universe
today even though cant see
diameter coming
96 something like billion mile
full diameter could see
galaxy horizon today thats
look like would need
infinite speed light thats im
giving
possible im giving
observational limit universe
temperature way
measure universal
clock temperature also work yeah
universe grows
temperature cool
onetoone correspondence
back extrapolate early universe
there murder scene um
forensic morbid
well thats brain
think uh
figure based temperature
body body died yes
thats whats happening hadnt
thought way thats
work yeah got crusty old
cop got got
sexy sidekick thats right male
female havent thought
well thats im whats
next question okay uh joe lero
liperella uh pennsylvania
relativity tell u object
approach speed light
deep gravitational well time slows
stop relative observer
question side
extreme object
motionless zero
gravitational effect would
time work object there zero
gravity
time go fast well
object motionless there zero
gravitational effect right
would time work
presence gravity age slower
like ultimate antiaging
hack bottle
qvc right
dog pony show call star talk
could making big buck
start qvc channel yeah
dr tyson qvc hack
asking theyre asking
question side
extreme word relativity
tell u object approach
speed light deep
gravitational well time slows
stop okay watch
year ago people realized couldnt
accelerate past speed light
preclude particle existing
faster light cant
accelerate past exist
side
serious thought given
point there movie
based there
hypothetical particle
property called tachion
takios greek meaning fast
tachios tachons tachons would live
backwards time possible
time slows reach
speed light side
speed light continue
equation jumping gap time would
go backwards heck yeah
yes yeah know
exist never never found
could theory
something
allowed exist einstein
equation something allowed
thats good enough reason go
look part one
point stop looking
seriousness go doesnt
cant find welcome frontier
science like cant find
phone house im going
keep looking go know
dont know thats right
mystery give someone
else find month later
time meet object gravity
movement like lazy good
nothing 15yearold son wont mow
lawn right lay sits
answer question
yes clear
answer wait wasnt two
part yeah there uh
object approach speed light
deep gravitational well time slows
stop yes deep gravitational
well yes time slows okay correct
side
extreme would techons
techons know
havent found okay correct got
techons work equation
result saying
well write way maybe
prediction equation
work well got
motionless space far youre
concerned youll still
timeline matter
people say fly
everyone
different time reference
care clock
wristwatch clock
wall thats care
thats youre moving
there
gravity
time speed
object motionless
there zero gravitational effect
would time work object
talking
joking gravit
antiaging hack right
word thered aging
time there right there zero
gravitational effect yeah
everyone else around
reference frame age exactly
rate could 1 second
every 10 second outside club
right right wont matter
cant hack system
say want go back
younger okay youre smart
tell group going
get plastic surgery first avoid
aging process yeah plus youre
space zero g surgery arent
necessary
well yeah right
got nothing pulling nothing
pulling stuff float thats
invent invent
people zero g facial surgery like
question simple
straightforward interesting dennis
albertie please explain buoyancy
buoyancy love right
density end
day density gravity
know gravity yes
less dense medium
youre immersed float
top simple
complicated define density
much matter cram
certain volume big advance
amazing didnt happen
19th century early
variance 18th century
really took 19th century
fact could float metal
make boat
metal almost impervious
war
iceberg billion dollar gross
movie exactly titanic
probably two three
billion look summarize
submarine boat denial well
here happens
react good line
submarine boat denial
hole thats made metal
bit metal would sink
bottom however
hole shape pressing
water water rising youve
created environment average
less dense water
therefore float
vshaped volume
air get add air plus
metal part content thats
within within volume
systematically reduce
density material go back
thousand year ago people made boat
wood sensibly wood
float make anything
wood would float made complete
sense youre susceptible attack
took metal plank 4
12 piece metal flat threw
water would sink yes
dont vshape dont
rel relation air
volume
volume carve
volume mass shell
divided full volume whole
thing get low
lower water itll float
principle iceberg
float youve iceberg
simply less dense water right
simply less dense dont need
vshape iceberg
mean dont dont
ever need vshape except mean
like styrofoam make boat
doesnt need vshape right
shape important know
material youre working heavier
stuff right
youre display want
displace correct right
displacement correct bottom
line um iceberg float got
vshaped hull steel float yes
styrofoam cooler best scenario
sit tap get couple
beer time
time okay thats im paul
got time one one got
okay actually
interesting one terry burke st
louis question simple nuclear
fision fusion small amount
matter lost converted large
amount energy gravity
associated lost mass also lost
great question way
gravity emanates mass
also energy mass energy
thing different side
coin youre losing
mass
energy youre losing combination
two go hand hand
answer gravity
associated loss
never vary mean
con constant never
idea gravity
associated lost mass also
lost oh matter energy one
thing mhm
distort fabric space time
thats need know
okay mhm commonly think
matter distorting space there
energy distort space
well equal mc² reminds u
theyre two side coin
amount energy created
amount gravity lost
word like mass lost
gravity associated lost mass
also lost lose gravity
energy thats created leaf
system yes youre losing youre
losing gravity anytime matter
energy leaf system know
doesnt sort change
time know depending
amount energy thats created
energy created gravity
lost yes lot
energy small amount mass
wouldnt lose sleep well
listen lose sleep
walk life
caring science way
cant weird though human
onethird rotation earth
semicomaos
one last question ill quick
one okay okay uh mc mark used
bell dont know
mark portland oregon
solar system comprised
remnant single supernova
collection many many im curious
galaxy diffuses multiple
supernova together okay first
supernova huge explosion
gut scattered everywhere
start galaxy rotates
say
differentially inner part
complete circle faster outer
part shear gl gas cloud
contaminated
detritus supernova explosion
get rotation galaxy
stuff becomes well mixed
next generation star going
ingredient last
round supernova explosion
like fertile ground next round
yeah got way
right think thats good
question wow yeah excellent patreon
member general
audience general audience
way join patreon special
custom qampa session
thats side patreon
payw wall yeah worth paying
dress elizabeth
character cq
thats youre missing
youre cheap join right
good oh give gold
bar everybody thats
sword sword say
got use sword right every
patreon member get puppy
pony pony
right done yet another
installment cosmic query paul
mccurio well find show
road yeah paul mccuriocom
someone say take show road
thats
new york authority
called said take road
uh uh uh inside paul
mccuri podcast movie
called inside thanks
bringing u
help get people come oh yeah
copied something dont go see
