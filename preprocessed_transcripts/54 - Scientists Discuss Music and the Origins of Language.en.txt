standpoint
yes star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist
got chuck nice chuck
man hey neil right okay
star talk special edition
ive got star talk special
edition also get gary thats right
edition gary oreilly going
take u gary tell
u generally speaking music
pleasure appreciate artistry
enjoy performance music
transport u another time place
alter emotional state ask
throw audience
trance performer flow
state get awms nasty
little rascal theyre
annoying music
gift ancient greek knew way back
music power heal
talking cognitive neuroscience
music need someone
special whose range nothing
short
extensive daniel leverton phd
cognitive neuroscientist expertise
music
psychology multimillion bestselling
author another musician

working best
business mean best
scratching surface say
load award
load stuff neil enjoy show
sorry cant co stopped
uh know youre going great
great time going
fantastic show thanks gary sorry
cant u daniel levon
daniel welcome start talk thank
neil yeah listen dude
youve done everything life
havent done interview yet
okay
die youre primarily
released book yeah
going talk bit
mostly human brain
music look background
starting music producer
knew everybody anybody who anybody
book connects music
neurological health maybe kind
knew well book 350 page
412 didnt read
note
end good good read 4000
peerreviewed article wouldnt
theyre note
good thats bu book yeah
analyze put narrative
something always suspected true
didnt really evidence
right let start
square one movie close encounter
third kind communicate
alien initially musical tone yeah
make bold assumption alien
hear right sense
assuming life
form might
dont thats bias f see
bias put alien plus
bipedal head two
eye nose mouth ear okay thats
bi also lousy taste
music actually like
song played awful
four note
yeah idea five
note idea
sufficiently advanced technology society
thing like fibonacci
series geometric series power
two idea might
universal language math would
obvious one entertaining
spielberg movie perhaps
prime number popping
thats right right right thats would
totally fed geek world
would flocked film
comment care
music know know music
auditory uh doesnt leave kind
trace say cave painting right
lot speculation
say tra historical evidence
archaeological physical evidence right
although bone flute
dated 40 60000 year ago oh
wow theyve found
well said like thats
thing mean someone took femur
carved blew air
made flute yes said
bone flute like get corner h yeah
know shut shut cuz
many many joke go bone flute
exactly right point
yes somebody find
femur right drill hole
precisely spaced interval right get
particular picture theyre 40 60000
year old theyre among oldest
artifact find human burial site
im guessing might done
wood cu easier wood
doesnt last long going say
calcifi califi bone wood wood
would turn dust yes
interesting thing okay well
went much trouble
technological thing know
drilling hole however
bone flute wouldnt
first musical instrument would
stretching skin across stump
would beating chest
bobby mcfarren style perfectly
reasoned bone flute requires
sufficient effort right surely
instrument made
less effort got
didnt last okay right yes make
sense
instrument happen without
anything singing yeah singing
banging two keep beat early
rock
music see
coke bottle
time okay agree existed
agree ask question
field journal called
behavioral brain science
interesting model peer review
journal somebody writes target article
dont know
astrophysics uh somebody writes target
article people around
world qualified field get
write commentary peer rev
commentary peer reviewed
idea put forward
maybe 40 50 people weighing
think
really wonderful thing
well
journal nature right
write article article
little bit controversial editor
solicit comment ive written
okay beyond
dont freeforall
describe nice thing help
field cohere kind
consensus almost town hall yeah
target article people get write
response yeah mentioned
2019 couple
target article evolution
music something devoted
whole book 2008 world six
song subtitle musical
brain created human nature idea
know like many thing
evolution youve explained
public better anyone thing
dont evolve typically single
reason single purpose there
there bunch different
evolutionary pressure case
music least six
independent line music became
important encoded genome
passed culturally
genetically give
significant one
survival uh qualified im
six one six
asked rank order im
evolutionary biologist okay give
six okay favorite six
okay go favorite think
transmission information
within culture across generation
talking also
write thing weve written
language planet 5000
year fact almost defines history
well thats right absolutely
know human planet
40 100 200000 year longer
depending define human
time weve
planet writing
believe studying
contemporary hunter gatherer society
cut western
civilization industrialization
every reason believe theyre
living way might 20000
year ago believe used
music encode knowledge example
learning would song
would encode root
well right roote
take well one go
dry song say dont go
mountain greatgrandfather
og went neighboring tribe
killed make
watertight canoe boil
plant poison music
first available
evidence lab many others
around world whats lab
way mill university mill canada
yeah yes okay uh laboratory
music cognition expertise
available evidence neural
structure encode music
phenetically older
encode speech wow evolutionarily
musician talking
one another thats seems
brain development
standpoint yes steven myan
written wonderful book called
singing neanderthal mh posit
sort proto language
music sound like great punk group
sing singing yeah suggesting
made sound dont yet
word could imagine writing
language think sound
put together musical yeah
there two part let talk
sound without language sound
language dont mind ill
go backwards time
language set language
music word set
music word would become encoded
preserved memory uh far
greater resistance distortion oh
god right youve got
mutually reinforcing cue rhythm
accent structure meter rhyme scheme
there limited number way
fit word
space look ilad
odyssey orally
transmitted long poem old
testament bible uh yeah psalm
song thats right old
testament sung right
ever written thousand year
preserved far know fairly
accurately song able
resist large degree distortion
simple speech make perfect
sense simply teach
child song first abc yes
nursery rhyme sung little
kid learn body part song
right put right foot put
right foot put right foot
turn head shoulder knee toe
knee toe everything learn
kid mean lot learn
explains would
evolutionary value
remember lesson yes water
hole food get
eaten right like equivalent
dance sang like bee dance
thats give direction yeah yeah
thats give bee
waggle wagle wag might
suggest among vertebrate
least bird engage song oh
well whale song call song maybe
theyre angry theyre
complaining well really
human whale equivalent
get lawn get get hell
planet ive got
lomago sharpen question
animal offer evidence
musicality bird
think bird song whale think
whale song creature
make think melodic sound
one another thiss um
contentious question ethology
community remind ethology uh
study animal behavior thats
called ethology dont
know uh biology let say
ethology yeah ethology animal behavior
yeah cool thank let look
characteristic human music one
thing well sing
bird wont bird
sing know there another con
specific nearby bird whale song
communicative speak
one another speaking
specific intention usually
referring thing animal call
know referential
event world theyre either
meeting call call distress hey
everybody look there predator
hey there food
uh specific stereotyped
communication used
presence others arent
part changeable infinite
variety song bird theyre
riffing right melody
bird song identifier
smartone reason
work pull
sound dont change
song right right
could noisy environment
there bird find
bird bird new york
offspring bird illinois
bird brazil
specie theyre going sing
less song whole life
encoded know know
colleague evan balaban
study took embryonic dont remember
let well took yeah took
took egg emic bir took fertile
took thats egg egg embrio
right well yeah took fertile egg
okay let say chicken
get auditory cortex zebra
finch implant
developing brain chicken wait
zebra finch zebra finch
finch kind kind bird
song bird im literal
cuz know youll name stuff know
zebra finch take sber auditory cortex
put developing brain
vice versa zebra look
like finch finch zebra
stripe exactly exactly right got
question bird learning
song parent
environment hardwired
found chicken started
singing song finch
finch started clucking like chicken
oh hardwired sound
like great pixar movie
somebody mixed egg
beginning youre chicken ill
chicken want could whatever
want chicken
go scramble farm animal thatll
mess farm
hardwired uh action anim
everybody else right u
u everything know
animal communication
music way would define music
infinitely generative cant
model markov chain
evidence always enjoyed
music entertainment know
talk becomes
directional medium medium
direction telling
story giving
know information point
proof evidence historically
went still
determined
man jam love
much great song well one
us music create
bond mother infant
infant would imprint mother
singing voice know
relaxing comforting song release
prolactin soothing
tranquilizing hormone weve got
number different reason music
theyre subserved
different neurochemical system system
work even utero yeah
age 20 week auditory system
fully functional wow fetus
hear sound amniotic
fluid would like would change
frequency would
change frequency would change
frequency hear put
ear water
thing dont get difference oh
well mean like prism
change isnt exactly
change frequency speeding tape
simply play music
different medium doesnt change
frequency change frequency
emphasized others stick
ear underwater swimming pool
bathtub music playing youll
hear primarily hear bass
note though frequency
bait note hasnt shifted appreciably
although water different medum
mayor could calculation
see think think
okay okay let table
moment yeah value lullabi
example
soothing auditorally
soothing chemically described
yeah whats chemical
prolactin prolactin
soothing tranquilizing hormone
calm
neuro hormone yeah
different music activate different
part brain yes holy moly music
activates every part brain
far mapped oh goodness
thats astounding activates
mean part brain respond
every piece
music okay music reizes
brain would account
say smell
hear piece music take
right back time place
everything explicit without
even trying summon memory
depends music uh uh
mean current theory memory
neurobiology memory
everything youve experienced
thought get memory
problem getting
need get memory
call retrieval queue
retrieval queue unique
sing happy birthday thats going
bring back particular time
associated hundred heard
ninth birthday oh god
going happen play na n
hey hey kiss goodbye havent
heard long time tear
clown something associate
particular time life
brought back
uniquely associated time
life like pr melins right okay
smell thats pretty cool mean
popped
head said tony
bennett
alzheimers thing said
often even
midst episode could
remember even tony
bennett could sing song
could start playing left heart
would jump yeah would
start singing st louis
right almost worked thats messed man
know thats messed
probably cut dont dont cut
thats thats hilarious thats st
louis comedy gold kidding
mean mean thats
pretty wild reason saw
glen campbell
able perform well
affliction suffered yeah
ive opportunity privilege
see brain scan
tour half brain
offline alzheimers really made
half brain literally half
brain functioning
still best guitarist planet
arguably could still remember
song might two three
time row cuz couldnt remember
done act
intact yes drawing
part brain work must
well interesting thing
brain massively
sentence begin interesting
thing
brain
everything here uninteresting thing
brain right go give tell
something interesting brain
theyre massively redundant thats
came learn recent year
whatever circuit theyre
massively redundant uh make
evoltion sense get hit
head dont want lose ability
important thing thing
talk lot field
cognitive reserve analogy
youre marathon runner run
26 mile bad day covid
sprained ankle probably still
run five mile faster canh youve
got athletic reserve built
musculature uh air capacity
mention willpower right work
musician cognitive reserve
musical domain much
lose lot lot
circuit redundant
circuit still intact interesting
said book successful
aging reiterated chuck
lose half brain might
still able tell joke right
talking might
able ive made entire
living expression
half brain youd dangerous
half brain
okay go interrupted sorry go
learn instrument older age
write successful aging
previous book also
reiterated never late
learn instrument ne youre 70
80 late ill tell
story second
neuroprotective youre neuroplasticity
fancy word making new neural
pathway right whole
life ever heard oh
dont grow new neuron
true even learn music
later age yeah help
neuroplasticity neuroprotective
mean building
cognitive reserve new pathway
one thing invigorating
get sense agency uh really
selfefficacy learning something new
engage
greatest work made
greatest mind history story
grandmother think
person person al illustration
grandmother born berlin 1897
leave
nazi grandmother escaped
three daughter husband rest
family killed
80th birthday grandmother uh told
mother grateful
united state
able raise three child
country would take
said ever since
came 1939 every single morning
gratitude sang god bless america
song written another jewish
immigrant irving berlin would
sing song sing mother
went radio shack got
80 keyboard electronic keyboard
put little piece tape
number 1 2 3 4 5 six could play
melody played every morning
saw 81st birthday
taken tape cuz
memor moriz right hand part
82nd birthday worked
rudimentary harmony left hand
played song every morning
died
97 think learned
instrument way express
gratitude lot n
one powerful experience
daniel recent book uh
published n
nton ww nton thats thats
publisher yes anyone 70 get
reference okay yeah youre
eddie murphy fan youll get oh
yeah youll get one skit
yeah im ww norton im
happy uh yeah yeah book
ww nort one part
attraction oh right yeah
really yeah get 10
dont bet publisher uh
beautiful title
heard secret chord
great thats thats thats
beautiful song wrote um
leonard coh leonard cohen he got
heard secret cord
pleased lord hear
like oh gotta yeah give
willies even even
without knowing song make
feel gwenth paltro
know okay like book
reason yeah draw
yeah bundle
sale goop yeah exactly exactly
refer default mode
network one
biggest finding cognitive
neuroscience generation
brain want mind wander
might say something always
knew know lot thing
thought knew turned
true job behavioral
scientist little bit easier
uh astrophysicist
20000 year history people
thinking certain thing
test see
really folktale
rest idea mind
want
wander uh opposed paying attention
neural biological uh basis
take energy pay attention
something keep mind
wandering energy mean uh
neuron need work harder
metabolized blood oxygenated
glucose glucose fuel
brain already big consumer
body energy even within
youre dividing task
energy intensive isnt
paying attention something
engaged something making
decision us glucose
phrase paying attention actually
quite accurate youre youre paying
glucose limited capacity
source youve paying attention
something attention
flag brain mind start
wander called default mode
network discovered
colleague collaborator venod menan
stanford important
thing understand
default mode mind
wandering problem solving get
done think
obvious um im trying
solve problem eludes must
mean case solution
nonlinear connecting
b two thing knew
come nonlinear solution
typically happen
asleep dreaming another
manifestation default mode
dream get really
random yeah thats
get nonlinear
box thinking youre walking
supermarket aisle looking
cheerio suddenly come
solution getting default
mode happens automatically weve
worked hard unless try fight
get
three thing meditating walking
nature listening music think
everything weve described thus far
known u mood
setting memory jogging role
play state mind
medicine come there
something wrong measured
doctor
music fix alleviates
book wanted write 20 year
ago wrote brain
music enough evidence
medical application music
good scientist speaking
enough evidence im going go
okay
know many people dont think
way start youtube
channel get
thats every youtuber yeah
turn youtube youre looking
yes yeah evidence
weak didnt want go
share think
feeling ethical commitment
science uh taking
grant money ultimately either come
governmental agency tax
break private foundation meaning
taxpayer fund scientific research
believe every scientist
ethical obligation explain
spending taxpayer money
dont want spend taxpayer money
saying stuff aint weve
got book yeah there lot
foundation statement give
short list ailment
alleviated music ill start
wellness music boost immune
system particularly immunoglobuline
iga responsible fighting
infection mucosal system
covid cold music also boost
production natural killer cell andk
cell tea cell travel
site fight infection
sickly people world people
never listen music well
inverse true well well
talking significant uh
small effect mean certainly
always exception tale
distribution course quantify
statement improves
resistance wellness quantify
mean like p less 05 mean
much effect
immune system example
boost immune system uh better
say eonia vitamin c
thing people right
might gotten five cold year
listen music would get four
cold dont know dont know
well get five cold
wont bad well well well
thats right mean happen
yeah dont really know uh cant
dont want claim okay
know clinical study
laboratory study iga example
nk cell increased
point point whether theyre successful
fending disease there
lot variable okay
one thing say thing
improved yes separate
actually clinical trial
logical progression though
expect ca expect
loog logical right thats one thing
wellness parkinson
disease parkinson disease
characterized degradation cell
basil ganglion ive seen brain
map brain back yeah
underneath basil gangang ganglion
yeah group subcortical nucleus
connected brain
internal clock happens uh
dopamine normally used signaling
transmission information
cluster neuron wa dopamine
feelgood feelgood chemical
neurochemical neurochemical well
thats interesting thing dopamine
throughout brain
different thing different part
brain interesting youre
experiencing pleasure dopamine
released lyic system including
ventral tag menal area feel
pleasure dopamine different
thing different place help
maintain steady gate
synchronized circuit required
walking movement uh
thats degraded parkinson
give lopo supposed
promote dopamine clear
parkinson advanced enough youre
basically wheelchair bound right
start first sign might
shuffling youre walking dragging
foot um inability maintain
steady gate sometimes try walk
end running sometimes
walk end freezing
cant get started called fen
station find
play music people thats
tempo natural
gate activates subsidiary
redundant circuit weve got
population neuron fire
synchron music entrain
music predict next beat
going right allows
parkinson patient walk smoothly
there technique called rism rhythmic
auditory stimulation developed
colleague mine named michael tout
university toronto colorado
state developed let
guess thats play bgs
tell way use walk thats
exactly right music
sync
play music right tempo
neuron start firing
maintain steady gate
course therapy parkinson
patient able give get rid
crutch walker walk
month whoa music way
get brain without
pharmacologically cuz imagine
future wait minute
part brain remembers used
walk overridden
let go nip tuck
suppress boost youre
done maybe day come yes
music filling
gap yeah thats right another
interesting case chronic pain
acute pain kind pain okay tell
pain 680 million
drain annual economy u oh
well music doesnt stand
chance number one reason people
im surprised 680 million yeah
mean think painkiller
pain reliever pain people chronic
pain right
whole pain manag con
conservative number yeah number
one reason people go doctor
doctor report 80
patient come say hurt
80 doctor visit hurt
treat pain use two thing
weve using thousand year
bark tree synthetic
equivalence aspirin know
something poppy uh synthetic
equivalent heroin opiate opium lab
first show people
listen music like doesnt matter
whether heavy metal hiphop
classical jazz rampb music
like brain produce
endogenous opiate remind
endogenous mean internal brain
could said internal
use word endogenous
fancy know field see spot
sun call sun spot huh
okay like tell like see
sun call endogenous
sunspot okay endogenous keep
going brain producing
opioids uh help ease pain
producing
pharmaceutical level sufficient
level instead
oxicontin addiction might
able get away say advil
music maybe small much smaller
dose opiate much shorter
amount time whole opioid crisis
could potentially averted
whether anesthetizes
definitely help pain management
thats point right
either way either
painkiller
assist painkiller doesnt make
difference thats right doesnt make
difference wow yeah
sort
neurokinetic affliction might
touched music multiple sclerosis
arises know uh neuron
insulating sheath like wiring
house insulated
sending electrical signal
need insulation dont
interfere
myelin sheath white
fatty tissue call
white matter uh multiple sclerosis
loss myelination ouch oo
sound terrible cross
circuit yeah short circuiting yeah
brain signal music help
movement disorder multiple
sclerosis another kind movement
disorder stuttering mostly
boy mostly boy dont
really know inability
speak smoothly think
timing circuit
internal clock gone
ay music kind hijack system
steady tempo isnt helpful
people professional
neuroscientist one day find way
get inside brain fix
problem well inside brain
colleague eddie chang
colleague bob knight california
san francisco bay area
implanted array electrode inside
im ready fix everything
yeah well mean astonishing
way
happens people
epilepsy uncontrolled
electrical activity cause seizure
volunteer
experiment
human
weve 100 year
animal measure single
cell time know
far well figure
stuttering cell maybe
able treat treat
tourette syndrome yes yeah
tell tette disease
debilitating uh almost every case
accompanied tick unwanted motor
movement facial tick body
jerking often thought
disorder people swear
uncontrollably thats present
case thought yeah read
somewhere rarest
yeah oh right thats
rarest tourette people
actually swear uncontrol tick
often make sound
instead swearing like thats
right thats right know something
like music help
seems uh write um
musician seems youre scientist
sitting office hayden
planetarium dont know supposed
lie dont ask question say well
seems case anybody could
say tell something
lab statistical integrity
well talking
collection anecdote plural
anecdote data okay thats
good line good line
like thats good line
number case
anecdote come study case
billy ish perfect example
popular contemporary singer
tretts find shes
singing tourette seems go away
seems shes keeping log
shes observed monitored
uh observation people
like billy eish others grant
application go nih im
part panel thats working
nih white house science yeah
yeah mh francis collins big
promoter work though longer
ah head nih correct he he
white house science office
okay uh he working
eradicating hepc convened
meeting uh 50 scientist dc last
december music medicine oh uh
entrusted help choose
scientist would also
invited professional musician get
tap budget thats
allocated non traditional medicine
yeah there institute
alternative complimentary medicine
emilene edward uh run place
terrific nah
budget line oh right
yeah also national
institute neurological disorder
stroke ni addiction agency
national cancer institute think
26 institute interested
music medicine one thing
potentially huge cost
saver best example economy
go get surgery
likely preoperating theater
theyre going give valum benzo
dipene relax
anesthetize knocking
relaxing two different
thing theyre thing
volume might cost 5 cv
corner dwayne reed
whatever hospital average cost
know
750 oh pill pill youve got
compliance got regulation youve
got kind reporting need
done youve got know
overhead ridiculous number
study shown play
people relaxing music
chose important
point cant foist music therapy
somebody using music dont like
interesting opposite effect
im intrigued
progress active active
field research much
much last thing close
going tell
memory memory
work like took snapshot
physicist come brain
look state every neuron
going know memory lurk
hidden within
neurochemistry used know
forgot easy
really
low low low windfall
ground right thats even right yes
thats called bending picking
apple even low hanging
matter people claim least
hope one day upload
brain computer upload
configuration every cell
storing information would call
memory right uh idea
connectome sebastian sung
princeton others working
thats recent term right
connect home yes idea
parallel genome uh
enough know neuron
know
connect one another state
theyre given time
state neuron
preserve memory here
think mean
speculation experience
something example youre looking
sunset youre listening music
youre drinking nice glass red wine
thats experience
experience delivered beginning
uh stimulation impinging
sensory receptor setting
cascade neurochemical neuroelectrical
activity there group
neuron delivering
experience wine taste
bud uh olfactory system
olfactory bulb present
somewhere brain
selfconsciousness awareness
prefrontal cortex whats
happening later remember
experience uh say lab
lab shown
neural family group neuron
pattern activated
memory allows
distinguish memory actual
event appears think
neurochemical tag get attached
event get stored memory
pull know
memory actual
event evolutionarily
important thing happens
dream neurochemical
tag say dream
otherwise might dream punched
nose come see
dont know thats
reality could lead another
punch nose would say wheres
evidence yeah getting punched
nose yeah
whats movie arnold
um total recall total total recall
instead paying expensive
vacation would sit
doctor chair would implant
memory
vacation yeah yeah would
good oh remember
beach found shell
yeah great cost 20
buck instead 2000 colleague
danny collaborator danny conan
recently passed away nobel prizewinning
psychologist nobel
economics study study
human being um irrational
brain irrational
documented need study
show irrational come
well cataloged
different kind
irrationality thats pretty cool
okay good enough know
irrational category
irrationality thats good work
one
studying
vacation people told could
fantastic vacation
life wont remember
uh itll free itll itll
good vacation itll cost
lot money remember
would prefer people prefer
one remember big
part going vacation
anticipation
memory year decade later
get interesting point could
memory
experience suppose would
something still musician
artist cant defend
scientifically feel like virtual
vacation implanted vacation would
like ai generated music would like
fake flower hotel lobby look fine
distance get close
enough realize doesnt nice
scent nice texture youve got
um uncanny valley real
dont want
false one well ive enough
experience life people
told good
time sure cannot remember
uh single mal scotch
involved much
one last thing memory heard
college
assume didnt hear
likely
remember something learned
reproducing state mind
time learned
youre studying chemistry book
youre high youre better
taking exam youre high yeah
true lady
gentleman failed
college didnt smoke enough smoke
enough called state dependent
memory retrieval discovered
one teacher gordon bower
stanford happen
oh discovered 70 im im
im im old enough
college 70 thats
remembered coming
big finding mean idea
study one classroom uh youre going
remember material better
youre tested classroom
retrieval cue
called term
state dependent memory retrieval one
experiment
parachuter h learn bunch
unrelated word youre falling
airplane try
recall either ground
falling airplane
turned finding wasnt strong
thought uh
actual
physical state
airplane state arousal
energized okay
complete duplicate scenario
duplication emotional
state emotional state
reason depression hard
treat people depressed
remember sad time life
right hard get
access happy memory
think oh never happy mean
cant draw upon good time
face bad time counter
like oh everythings bad
time music help one
promising thing im working
group ucla treating drug
resistant depression drug talk
therapy music play
somebody who depressed happy song
make feel worse youre
depressed usually
sense feel misunderstood
world others people
life put happy song
thats one person
understand youre furious
rubbing face right put
sad song suddenly there
somebody staring abyss
side
understand feel theyve
came
side created beautiful work
art daniel delight

thank much chuck always good
always pleasure gary
get well soon thanks taking u
