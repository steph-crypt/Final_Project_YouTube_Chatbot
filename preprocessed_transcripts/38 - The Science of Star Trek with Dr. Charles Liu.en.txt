fan star trek look star trek
say wow imagined could
travel hundred time speed
light imagined could flip
little device hand talk
someone thousand mile away
imagined could walk door
would open without touching
saw star trek least
believable part
future door know good
photon torpedo phasers
communicator quars
automatic door
happening like come
music
guy star talk neil degrass
tyson personal
astrophysicist cosmic
query edition mean got chuck
nice house thats right right
chuck whats happening
question today random
indeed one subject
thats right subject
subject star trek star trek star
overdue star trek episode
thats right could
get little way topic
get go deacon chief
called said make
charles lou welcome back star talk
thank neil hello charles l
dont know friend
colleague he professor
city university new york uh still
staten island youre graduate
center well yes yes interacts
graduate student thing right
combination yeah good good
podcast called
lunaverse
lune cool cant take
credit family told use
like really theyre like
yeah yeah yeah thats good thats good
well give one okay
learned boy proud
okay say cuz im 10 year
older get say
came dont
yet yet there
handy answer book series
okay okay handy put
favorite subject answer book right
okay one wheres
life okay handy quantum
physic answer book oh gosh everybody
claiming invoke quantum
physic explain stuff dont
understand need book absolutely
there little scher cat right
bottom oh got cat right
got little
ad oh gosh oh thats cool look
youve
dont research quantum physic
thats right use quantum phys use
quantum physic every day
user guide thats really
yeah answer book designed
sort reveal detailed deep
weed research result kind
like know quantum
wonder got little
question got little answer
there whole bunch whole biology
section okay quantum work
biology lot u dont understand
eye work quantum
quant yes uh photon
come hit eye
activate certain cell rod
cone activated quantum
reaction photon cell
molecule
absorbing photon something happens
photon get absorbed yeah
thats called
sight got chaff quantum
entanglement youve got bios people
contributed
size electron thats favorite
one love okay size
electron 10 theus 18
diameter thing
putting minus
measurement would
positive like gotta
negative fair enough billion
billionth meter billionth
meter billionth billionth
billionth billionth billion
nano whats
thats billion thats billion thats
billion isan get th
billion
right nano 10us 9 thats 10
10 9 10 9
yeah
yeah
nananan nanano okay thing
though electron small
weird profile size isnt
really determinant right
depending try measure
try thing minute
indeterminate measure
get number didnt say
didnt werent listening
didnt say size
electron said smaller
size smallest size
capable measure cant
measure anything smaller
smaller might mean
electron size could
know could
electron ex book got
get show oh thats see
happened
happened mess quantum
man
mess quantum get
horn quum get horn baby oh
go theyre entangled horn
okay okay star trek im old enough
say first round star trek
occurred living memory mhm thats
old thats cool didnt see
star trek rerun yeah saw
came weekly wasnt allowed
watch tv school week oh
good parent
episode would ultimately see would
rerun mh mh around
people talking star star trek
meant people
culture cant believe got
show there black woman
answer phone shes actually
sitting next white
people
bridge crazy cra let let spend
minute get racial
let find um
technology find intriguing
remind u year
original season took place year
supposedly took place around year
20260 okay would 200
year future thats right
1760s look 1960s surely
1960s would look like 2260 surely
thats completely rational thinking
right could mean uh
however look 76 theyd koga
wagon 1960s going
moon thank im there kind
hockey stick um element pression
didnt read recent book
think hockey stick
think going
faster light travel didnt say
didnt say im saying
hockey stick uhuh deeper
know answer always hockey
stick like okay ill get ill get
going happen see
going charles
impressionable kid techn
ologist culturally uh youre scientist
science technology star
trek really impacted well always
feel think back albert
einstein said creativity
imagination important
knowledge could imagine
einstein say there
dumbass people dont
know get certain stage
truck influencing
basic level knowledge
course extremely important order
really make advance really
imagine something exist
right dream yeah yeah
come star trek fan
star trek look star trek say wow
imagined could travel
hundred time speed light
imagine could flip
little device hand talk
someone thousand mile away hello
imagined yeah imagined
could walk door would
open without touching
trek came around automatic door werent
course hear
ive said hundred time ill say
saw star trek
least believable part
future remember said yes
thats thats im saying
said door know okay
good photon torpedo
phasers communicator tri quars
automatic door
happening come guy
best best
pressure pad thats right going
like supermarket going
supermarket got grocery
thing youd step pad
needed room door swing swing
pocket door anything
tell yeah
technology well
kid didnt know yet revolutionary
stuff naturally
assumed like oh okay
future theyll phaser thing
uh really cool
phasers could set stun
really like fact
designed lethal youre
kid thats future yeah
theyre thinking future 200
year dont know theyre thinking
near future
future lifetime people alive
time show go
list tablet computer
got got check check checklist okay
hand right tablet okay
getting paid apple
hold logo front okay
apple
call got read everything
like
uh tablet computer handheld
communicator right fact went
flip phone thats old
thats old thats old news thats old
try go back who got
samsung foldy thing z
flip think theyre theyre trying
still feel flip telepresence
zoom everybody meet
everybody atampt already
heel video phone
dont think people realized
time call someone
dont always want looking
well yeah learned
hard way pandemic oh
goodness know 2001 space
odyssey already video phone
right right beginning movie
somebody calling child
end atampt say know cost 170
thanks calling exactly
2001
film shot 1968 thats right
within couple year
star trek thats right theyre
imagining video phone 200 year
future 35 year future
got correct yeah got
little correct well
clearly everybody got correct
matter went galaxy
matter specie
encountered lieutenant aora put
screen person would come
screen theyd like yeah
charles wheres camera putting
screen exactly
know backlit screen
probably oled something like
lot technological thing
actually done entertainment
storytelling purpose right
scientific imagination uh world yeah
transporter classic example
didnt want spend lot time
shuttling people back forth
little boat
immediately instantaneously brought
someone
became cool
feature entire show people
started rcon retro actively
try figure physic
behind ran kind
problem sort said yeah
sort work give
hall pas one yeah yeah cuz
heard cost dont
heard didnt verify
seemed plausible cost
would take ship
land people get ship
get back ship go back
dock right there there cost
given many time going back
forth planet stage
landing spacecraft
take pulled
orifice make happen like
whats word use retro rcon
retroactive con
thats thing never heard
common comic book
something happens
go back say oh
stitch back together
reverse engineer science
pretty much thats
youre okay yeah
uh warp drive thats
really blew open
think want didnt say oh
go faster light
didnt knew thats
allowed thats right
hat einstein
important way called warp
factor whatever right warp
drive eventually became also
significant storytelling thing
meant engine
engine uh worked uh
exotic material new thing
invented called dilithium dthi crystal
crystal somehow important
making matter antimatter
transaction work properly although
term matter antimatter werent used
much original star trek
werent yeah later
socalled photon torpedo also
revealed basically big chunk
antimatter uh torpedo
could fire people
idea come uh sense
got get point point b
know theyre far away
find way get
take somewhere
thats usual dimension space
led kind wonderful
story numerous episode
sort warp drive failure sort
transporter failure uh would lead
story line yeah yeah thats true
really good stuff one one
revered episode called mirror
mirror uh transporter accident
accidentally brings several member
bridge crew parallel universe
something might think
many world interpretation quantum
mechanic right exactly
parallel universe everyone evil evil
spar evil
kirk marvelous story right
could tell evil spark

video description let get back
show old day
white hat black hat
goatee devil
goatee right thats right wonderful
story wouldnt one one
let issue thing
maybe could thought
little deeply example
phasers came ship yeah
directed energy weapon
yeah like variant laser course
phaser able see
side
correct un know hit chalkboard
eraser make cloud see
go vacuum
space thats right
visible side thats right
rcon also idea
oh okay idea
phasers laser completely
different thing addressed later
episode star trek next
generation showed laser
extremely weak compared phasers
phasers whole different kind
energy beam weapon right result
could seen side
furthermore dissipated time
missed wouldnt keep
going know take planet
accident yeah six year later there uh
ship explodes
houston problem smoke
right youre saying
powerful there energy leakage
sideways
know whats funny read great
thing uh uh jean rotenberry
coming originally
going call laser ah
said well laser real technology
got futurize right got
make sure know laser
10 year well look kind
stupid got got future
proof thats really smart
indeed laser wound everything
use right day laser
floyd big attraction
evening hour weekend
planetarium right thats 1970s
late 80 laser like impulse
item kmart longer could
say let go see laser right lost
draw laser light show
saturday night yeah yeah
exactly uh one last thing
got go qampa thats
whole point okay uh hard
enough convers somebody
moon mhm mhm light
travel time yes delay like two two
half second yes cant
witty reparte right theyre talking
people halfway across galaxy
start trek thats right dont know
addressed
original series original series
really wasnt addressed
accepted fact expect yeah
could okay uh
transponder communicator
instantaneous next
generation came idea
subspace communication uh
properly addressed
communication go
regular space fact almost
different dimension kind sid
stepped dimension ordinary
space went kind
communication wormhole
able kind communication
instantaneous way faster
even fastest starship sense
transporter yeah cuz get
question every
say close
transporter say sometimes
goal solved different solution
might creative simpler
one think necessary
thats right foresee day
get command wormhole
step wormhole yeah
dont need trans dont need
dont need disassemble
entire molecular construct uh uh
makeup put back together put
back together correctly right well
sense right youre dependent
network right star trek discovery
series uh focus something called
melium network right based
mushroom mushroom almost yeah right
course mushroom
popular science fiction
basis last u zombie yes
fungus broadly fungus
mushroom mycelium thing
clear fungus
branch kingdom tree
life right adverse cool
animal plant correct within
fungus kingdom thing like
yeast also mushroom
eat mushroom thatll kill u
mushroom thatll take take
subspace trip right
network like much like
public transportation network
go certain station certain
place want right allows
go literally anywhere want
go whenever want go im saying
machine open
wormhole like like rick rick
morty like like mr mr magic guy uh
who guy dr strange doctor strange
open hole wherever want
whenever want dont dont try
defend transporter ba
youre magic dude youre
science anymore rick us real real
science oh course yeah
ob yes whereas dr
us
magic right duly
informed whole study
melium network mushroom
mushroom general fungus micology
yes think pretty cool
wonderful area study recently heard
scientist describe possibility
reason mammal able
evolve dinosaur
terrible extinction right
better relationship
better relationship fungi
really body temperature
allowed u resist infection
parasitic relationship uh fungi
whereas say reptile cold
blooded 65
million year reptile stay know
like crocodile example theyre
still roughly used
whereas way different
little tiny reptilian chuck still
reptilian brain still
reptilian without doubt u
bigger u smaller
also like sound rock
oh belly exactly mouth wide
open forgot youw open mouth
dont um look tree
life yeah impress
intrigue common
ancestor animal fungus
mushroom human yes split
later tree life
common ancestor split green
plant mean human mushroom
genetically related either
u green plant green plant
aint aint something pretty
amazing thats thats maybe
thats love shitake much thats
im saying thats
one ever accused kale tasting
meaty thats true people used
word mushroom nobody ever
kale burger people
portell burger portell burger
umami thats described common
meat mushroom mushroom
mommy flavor thats right
eat go
mommy came thats
yeah thats japan
first came one
think japanese right abely
japanese aaron jack jackson say hello
dr tyson starlord uh dr lunaverse
oo thank aaron lake balo
california question
spacetime travel warp speed
planet 100 light year
planet b would take starship
voyager 100 year arrive warp
speed 101 question doesnt
get closer farther away planet
duration 100 year
depending respective trajectory
word expansion
universe take warp speed
take account expansion
universe
presume must right
hard make calculation right
charles talking
universe expanding far
time take adourn tv
commercial keep mind
travel fact
almost travel star trek
happens within milky way galaxy
within space expansion
universe completely counteracted
gravitational pole thats
object galaxy right
make sure got clear right
experiencing expansion
universe coalesced
gravity galaxy
experiencing like outside
galaxy kind
together moving together make stronger
point force keep
body together molecular force
gravity proximity earth
earth proximity sun
sun proximity center gy
tighter expansion
universe would manifest
scale okay got win right
right like expansion
universe never going pull u apart
get place big r
called big rip oh jesus christ oh
god anyway go ahead thats whole
another show whole another show
explainer another episode right
wouldnt worry motion
something compensate
problem sure he
asking question
star trek version warp drive
arent pulling object thats
front closer
expanding space behind
youre effectively moving fast thats
he asking thats warp
shell bubble yeah thats thing
miguel aluer suggested
calculation man
world im telling right
like mentioned warp driv
like michelle
like come
didnt come kuer he guy
there lot written idea
right enabling okay paper
would intriguing
interesting right
scientific community okay scifi
people took ran ran
oh gosh well opened
whole new world well enjoy
kind fun way
pronounced french way he
spanish mexican meic oh really yeah
oh like michelle whats
v miguel
miguel miguel miguel miguel right yes
true pull space backward
forward continuity
star trek idea youve done
pulling snap back place
havent noticed change
happened fast wow dont
worry space time
distance distorting longterm
basis happens quickly
youre traveling
bubble kind yeah treat space
traveling space like
okay amazing right let go keep
going go oh goodness
dont know say never
know say anybodys name
exception right im g call
joe joe samuel lopez um
say hello star talk enterprise oh see
joe uh jlo
portugal here simple question
star trek character identify
thank
good totally answer one
oh yeah answer kind copout
actually reason like star trek
dont affiliate
individual character like story
separate thats cop app thats
told thats told
whats name
chuck okay oh chuck okay one
like mr spock
loved logical thought
would great live life
without emotion never affected
thing able assess
analyze one truly identify
scotty he
always freaking hell know
got come im sor shes got
blue c cant like he
always like
always said cant
always know
would scotty real
james tiberious kirk really
really ive
leadership position mh lead
many different way right right
one lead
example another one
follow everyone want
youre leader youre
actually following right
thats technically elected
official supposed thats right
okay youre manag rather okay
different way
kirk would get
fight john luke peard ever go
fisty cuff anybody oh yes
much captain kirk didnt
always flashback
though
c oh youre referring tapestry yes
episode get stabbed
heart angry nosin pool
fight well dom jock technic end
end defining
pivotal moment life allows
dynamic decision
definitive person
like fact yeah spock
could beat kirk game chess
kirk made decision
always always logical right
mean human
human fully experiencing
everything make human
mean emotion flow
way manage
control perhaps certainly express
wow fact would
fight fight could outsmart
computer always wanted power
okay uh know computer say uh
prime director must
wait minute
contamination must
error
error yeah yeah yeah thats right
sterilized episode would put
loop computer couldnt
get smoke would come
computer yeah think
thats really something uh william
shatner writer put
got feeling william
sh like going dumber
computer certainly going
dumber
nemoy youre going make win
chess beat computer like
little weird come fact
beat guy chess okay
identified immensely character
wow right thats cool okay thats cool
love yeah thats cool there many
like hard thats
hard question know oh
way sbe christie star
trek memorabilia auction yes okay
attended multiday thing
big attended one thing
obscure fact one
thing sold auctioned mhm
foam
phasers phaser hip
stunt double goa scene
make sense wow dont
get hurt dont get hurt yeah
break phase cuz know like
six thats right
let
honest cool thought
everything right youre filming
got cool ever wanted
one question universe

universe earth always keep
looking right go
bryant brian say close
developing warp drive engine
human ability travel
faster light first
faster light trap well
possible mean period
talking miguela kuer war drive
idea right warp space
object travel space faster
light straightforward rule
object distinct energy photon
thing though right
might able travel faster
whole idea
warping space bending youre
traveling medium space
faster speed light
youre youre bringing point
space together unfolding
traveled fast
speed light broken
speed limit
arent effectively moving
wormhole connect two point
though still still wormhole
world people talking
theyre traveling faster light
moving point point b
right speed faster 18622 mil
hour per second excuse right
kind thing
describing exactly neil described uh
sort passageway make
differ actually move point
point b speed still
make space allow u get
point space point b space
faster light would taken u
get still mathematically
possible energetics though
way mathematically possible well
einstein general theory relativity
right show einstein field equation
like way say dude einstein showed
explain okay
didnt mean way chuck im sorry
saying einstein
general theory relativity field
equation basically moment
uh even 100 year theyve
written um solution
understand manipulate
mathematics many many
different way
nonsensical physically
might actually show
possible way moving space
time sort faster like
warping technique order
uh enough energy move motion
uh kinetic stuff thats part
get stuck math show
way warp space time make
happen actually getting piece
mass like spaceship
point point
piece as piece mass
piece like swear
thats said
compliment matter okay
statement true
said referring mass question
charles
taste thank
okay okay okay go yeah thats
work move space
time moving piece material
one point space time another
point space time requires
lot mathematical
let settle
matter new physic matter
technology working within solution
already known physic thats right
wow think far away
far away right yeah
possible heard
ruled completely love right
okay go got
minute see many opal leman
space nerd opal leman space nerd say hi
name opal leman chuck thats
layman okay
god im 14y really 14 hey oh man
im 14yearold atlanta georgia
wondering antimatter
warp drive containment system work
read somewhere space chronicle
book would need hold
antimatter chamber made
antimatter wouldnt
interact matter
wondering antimatter containment
system would held would
suspended field magnet
correct way
love 14yearold thinking
wonderful thing
love 14yearold dis
thought ahead know
would need help
saying matter antimatter
course annihilates
contact contained within
magnetic vessel right magnetic bottle
kind would b basically
bounce side bottle
without ever touching matter
exterior would make need
make sure antimatter
charged either positively negatively
would create bottle
kind charge
would contained inside socalled
bottle actually physical
bottle made way charge
field bottle field
bottle charge interact
magnetic field
one force
electromagnet force
go together thats theyre
separate entity cool
thats talk
amazing theyre like
charged theyre kind bouncing
thats right dude thats
amazing exactly love god even even
science fiction awesome science
thats great right right
go um brian lacy brian say
hi guy baltimore brian
baltimore technological
need increase need
strong reliable power grid star
trek theyre powering giant ship
even bigger space station know fusion
always 20 year away far
future using also
powering similar smaller device
like phasers thats right amazing
phaser small
huge power source right yeah wheres
power come dont
say dilithium crystal dont
enough captain dont enough
okay question hasnt
satisfactory answered uh idea must
sort amazing
battery right sort power supply
store enough power like
dont see refueling anywhere
thats right wipe
entire building something thats
palm hand
make sense actually
set phasers overload dont
know would ever include
happens overload blow
like bomb use
device right oh oh thats sound
make
know blow
right yeah way
draw power something like
must sort battery
capacitor something like
never properly described
could put
something quickly tell everyone
capacitor capacitor
basically two plate conducting
thing like metal typically
store charge one waiting jump onto
basically
something work uh like
battery transfer huge amount
electricity quickly example
defibrillator capacitor
battery charged
capacitor
defibrillator go capacitor
sends thousand volt fraction
second thats work
one one contact
correct go heart
ideally pump reset
unfortunately
power source device
never properly described
convenient assume
battery capacitor
incredible power okay chuck dont
know much got time like one
question really
man dog going go
steph steph say captain log 2024
alpha omega greeting dr tyson lou
lord chn thats thats enough
uh say reflect
world star trek set
around year 2260 wonder
feasibility achieving advanced
technology depicted series
time considering back
future envisioned technological
landscape early 2000s
closely aligned actual
progress aside absence
flying car prospect
realizing similar advancement
portrayed star star trek
year 2260 know yeah
looking really looking
okay ill put way call
percentage
technological wonder see
star trek actually exist
year within 200 year 200 year um
prediction uh 1
disappointing 1
stuff shown true lot
great stuff think whats already
happened right communicator video call
talking talking
right there lot thats
already existed weve basically hit
point star trek technology
stuff reg break
technology cuz thats really
cool thats long long technology
long used phrase dont wor
techology technology credit
credit yeah weve reached
point stuff dont know
work yet basically need physic
dont understand yet one
hundred physic dont
understand resolved im happy im
psyched right got see
youre thats youre
relating back actual science
discovery may make
allow technological advance
come true thats made point
earlier missing physic
missing techn
occ
without scenario got
technology amazing fun thing
right need attendant physic
go think thats
im excited
amazing thing discovery
study break
physic level know dark
matter dark energy start
yeah dark energy opposite
gravity right everything
gravity wanted
harness oh god yeah
exactly yeah youre talking
entirely new realm physic opening
upm physic yeah thats wow im
excited think realm physic
thats really exciting way look
realm physic 1900
little earli first hint
something unusual going inside
adam centennial
decade development discovery
quantum physic interesting whole
realm ena computer
storage creation storage retrieval
information digital information
without exploitation quantum
quantum physic oh gosh segue
right back handy handy answer
book physic thats really cool man
here something clearly
never come true hasnt
come true yet okay every scifi movie
yes future everyones wearing
clothes ah yeah noticed
everybody got
shoulder thing theyre
wearing gleep right
resisted day
think thats one
easiest thing resist want make
thing uniform want make thing
predictable want keep
unpredictable individual
whats easiest way way
self expression
put body good like
okay anybody young child
know go phase
theyre like im going naked
know
remember day
freeing yes he like
restaurant cant right
like dont care
food want
naked child speak
16yearold high school girl
yeah office fact chair
oh even part original
invite came office
boyfriend oh big
astrophysics fan dragged
would learn like
engaging everyone come
office four
kid
sister parent guy
girlfriend sitting
tred engage everybody
said whatat
forgot said said
really like star trek hey said
shes 16 said whoo like much
like star trek said brought
gift dont know got
federation trivia book wow mission
one mission two w back
like type know typewriter
type face im gonna let let see
charles maintain oh he gonna
geek blow he gonna blow away
ill im good stuff 50 page
im good sort
stuff right go go
revised second edition 1976 oh gosh
dont know dc fontana oh shes
famous science fiction writer
wrote number beautiful episode
star trek look tell okay okay
okay okay okay spock last name
couldnt pronounce
good answer well played well play
well
played well played okay sulus
first name hikaru damn look man
killing getting lucky guy
year flint born know
who flint dont remember flint
happened scotty changing
know dont got
changed guess ling
okay name woman kirk cannot help
loving joan collins isnt

favorite episode really yeah totally
okay okay worst gangster name ever well
point trying
see im jojo cco see n thats
right okay planet
man trap planet
hey im sorry im drawing blank
dont know one
ala okay youre infallible
thats thats
needed oh please geek chief
bl blind spot yeah yeah
blind spot would
writer star trek
one writer
think science fiction
storytelling embedded within
often
allegory
challenge face everyday life
best yes
also represent dream state
future try hard enough
make
happen know going
happen without collective
investment without
collective sense want
waiting u
future ask without science
fiction would still cave
without somebody thinking future
rle science technology
invention
innovation without role could
play
life dont want live
world want always
live believing
knowing living
differently tomorrow today
differently living
better star trek gave u
glimpse future science
technology might bring episode
best also morality
tale cu good power
science technology going
future without wisdom harness
right right
neighbor presence power
there world without science
fiction dont want live
keep coming
dream tomorrow thats better
today cosmic
perspective two
professionally life served
radio announcer correct true
okay ive pretended
time want sequence
give smoothest radio voice
saying star talk keep
looking okay smoothest radio
voice going come
lineer audience going get
three time okay go charles
star talk keep looking
star talk keep looking
