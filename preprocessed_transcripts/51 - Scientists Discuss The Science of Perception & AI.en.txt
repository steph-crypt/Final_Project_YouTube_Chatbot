edition know mean weve got
chuck knight man hey
buddy always good
cohost also gary
oreilly former soccer pro sport
commentator crowd cheering
yeah thats thats crowd
uh tottenham tottenham yeah crystal
palace theyre
anytime mention name
room there crowd
effect gary know special
edition youve helped
branch star talk focus
human condition every way
matter mind body soul
would include ai mechanical
augmentation
robotics fit right
theme take u need
episode age ai
machine learning uh society
naturally star talk asking
sort question human brain
work apply
machine
one big question
perception uh get blob
neuron think thats technical term
yes technical sure yeah
skull understand world outside
guest kl friston one
world leading neuroscientist
authority neuroimaging theoretical
neuroscience architect
free energy
principle using physic inspired
statistical method model
neuroimaging data thats one big
success he also sought
people machine learning universe
give little background
carl neuroscientist
theoretician university college
london professor studied
physic psychology cambridge
university england inventor
statistical parametric mapping used
around world neuroimaging plus
many fascinating thing
owner seriously impressive array
honor award
time get speaks brit yes
he evened there
picking brick there
one okay carl friston
welcome star talk well thank
much point
speak american well please
dont carl take certain
level illiteracy im sure
dont
possess yeah please dont stoop
level
let let start uh
something field
principle idea
pioneered note known
free energy principle come
physicist there lot sort
way apply let
start free energy
principle well say ti
principle um spirit
physic therefore method
like hamilton principle bast
action prescription
formal mathematical prescription
way thing behave
use either simulate reproduce
indeed explain behavior thing
might apply principle released
action example uh describe
motion football free energy
principle special domain
application talk
selforganization thing uh
thing particle
people population
method really describing
thing selforganize
space give
whole new term know weve read
thought seeing
selforganization matter usually
there source energy
available though reach sort
minimum energy thats ite
state prefers
know ball roll table onto
ground doesnt roll
ground onto table seek
minimum place favorite
box morning breakfast
cereal always say
settling content may occurred
yeah open like
2third full two3 powder get
twothirds crushed shard h corn
flake finding sort
lowest place gra earth
gravitational potential need
new term well old
term guess um pursuing
american theme trace um
kind free energy back richard fan
probably phd thesis
trying deal problem
describing behavior small
particle invented kind free
energy proxy enabled
evaluate probability particle
would take path path
exactly mat
transplanted applied
movement particle back
refer belief updating
lovely introduce notion
um know nature finding
preferred state described
know rolling downhill free
energy minimum exactly
ambition behind free energy
principle preferred state
state belief representation
world something say
exist point
contact machine learning
artificial intelligence free
energy thermodynamic free
energy free energy score
probability explanation
world head right kind
explanation think
existence way make
sense world behavior
way sample world
effectively falling downhill
settling towards bottom
extremely itinerant way wandering
way sort go daily
life different temporal scale
described effectively um
coagulating bottom
serial packet preferred state
wow youre dont want
put word mouth dont
belong attempt
interpret understand
described didnt yet mention neuron
carrier
transmitter thought
memory interpretation
world talk
pathway understanding
world take shape pathway
track nearly semi infinite
connectivity neuron brain
youre finding
neuron naturally face
one stimulus versus another thats
absolutely right fact technically
describe neuronal dynamic
trajectory path nerve nerve
cell firing exactly performing
gradient descent variational
free energy literally true
think intuitively idea
um fact idea youve
expressed um trace back
poss l early day cybernetics
term good regulat theorem
idea well adapted
environment model
environment um word
interface interact world
sensation
model causal structure
world causal structure
thought literally embedded
connectivity within among
neuron within brain know
favorite example um would
distinction something
something universe
certain object
different position tell
something wouldnt
wouldnt know likewise
told something
wouldnt know
statistical separation like
literally installed anatomy
know two stream
back brain one dealing
thing scam
connectivity dealing dealing
thing however uh pliable
enough though uh course im
pushing back im trying
understand uh pliable enough
though say go get
thing okay give
specific coordinate thing
would know thing
would able find even
thing
yep speaks um something
quite remarkable
actually model
lived world sort
geometry navigated
presupposes youve got model
moving world know
way body work im
tempted bring groin
dont
chuck injured gr
day
ago offline thats he talking
weve heard since
carl hear term active inference
hear term basian active
inference let start active
inference play
part cognitive neuroscience active
inference think simply put would
application free energy
principle talking
description
applying math understand
behave sentient way active
inference meant emphasize
perception read unconscious inference
spirit helm hold depends upon
data actively solicit
environment know see
depends upon currently
looking speaks notion
active sensing went little fast
im im im sorry man im trying keep
okay went little fast
carl uh talked
perception um inference
somehow tied subconscious
please clear he
speaking slowly exactly
he going fast
keeping well listen dont
problem okay problem
keeping never
left behind way
problem keeping go wait
minute okay anyway like
break little bit sure
trying speak new york
pace apology ill ill revert
london um okay let start
beginning sense making perception
make sense world locked
inside brain locked inside
skull dark there
cant see information
conveyed eye ear
skin sensory organ
make sense unstructured
data coming sensory organ
sensory epithelium might
answer one answer
traced back day
plato count helmold helm
helds brought notion
unconscious inance um sound
glorious simply say
inside head youve got
model sensation caused
use model generate
prediction would sense
right ca got
right
hypothesis predict
match actually sense
confirm
hypothesis inference
get game much like
scientist use scientific
instrument say microscope
telescope order acquire right
kind data test hypothesis
structure universe
state affair
measured uh instrument
described sort
hypothesis testing putting
fantasy hypothesis belief
state affair outside
skull test um sampling data
testing hypothesis
inference inference uh
get game micro
step route establishing
objective
reality theyre people
model match prediction
might make world outside
would living
delusional world cannot
otherwise agree objectively
true would would
objective measure insanity
neological disconnect yeah really though
mean really well
project fantastical world
reality know doesnt sit
want thats
dysfunction youre working
youre working live
time yeah fast
fantastical
dysfunction actually place
talked james cameron
little bit youll see fast
fantastical
dysfunction worldbuilding
creation see series
movie really know
aberant know disfunction
different well think
he trying create artistically
rather impose upon yeah carl
everyone always received world
objectively would room art
oh good question
really well done
sir im gonna say think uh
inspiration question yes chuck
inspired question there role
side
perceptive reality correct absolutely
pick couple
theme last point think
quite key certainly case
one application one use active
inference understand psychiatric
disorder youre absolutely right
people model lived world
thats quite apt situation
find say
something change say lose loved
one world change
prediction way sort
navigate day either
socially physically changed
model longer fit purpose
world chuck saying
brain incredibly plastic
adaptive
use misl
predict going happen
actually sense update model
world saying
um model would able
generate prediction
would see particular hypothesis
fantasy make link
back ai generative ai
intelligent forecasting prediction
jed model entailed exactly
connectivity talking
brain
free energy principle manifesting
readjust change
finding new
root presumably
accurate understanding
world lower free energy
state higher lower
yeah absolutely right
actually technically know go
cognitive u neuroscience
youll find big move past 10
year towards notion predictive
processing predictive coding
rest upon meane
brain constructive organ
generating inside
prediction sensorium
mismatch prediction
error prediction eror used
drive
neurodynamics allow
revising updating belief um
prediction
accurate therefore prediction
error minimized key thing
answer question technically
gradient free energy drive
downhill prediction
error minimized
minimized free energy
youve absolutely excellent youre
going roll uphill unless there
change environment
think back early
mankind predictability im
walking along see lion long
grass start predict
run tree high enough lion
wont get run along
ground line probably going get
kind evolutionary weve
born survival yes
misinterpreted completely
think thats excellent point um well
let think mean
um able predict exactly
would sense given situation
thereby predict also whats going
happen next
environment youve reached
bottom serial packet
minimize fe minimize
prediction error fit
world model world
accurate way adaptive
fitness look process
unfolding evolutionary time
youve read
variation free energy
negative adaptive fitness
tell immediately evolution
one free energy
minimizing process also
like testing
hypothesis kind denis
environment kind creature
good fit
particular environment
actually read natural selection
statistic known basian
model selection infected
inheriting inference learning
transgenerationally way thats
minimizing free energy minimizing
prediction error thing
get eaten lion dont
ability promate propagate
next generation
everything end bottom serial
packet uh avoiding line
thing
one didnt minimize
free energy yeah unless gary
made baby said wonder
thats lion bush let go
check theyve got jean
there line name
thats exactly right want share
one observation carl
want hand back gary know
want get ai side
yeah remembered one book
douglas hoffstead might
girdle eer bach
brilliant exploration
mind body end one
book appendix dont
remember conversation einstein
brain said
stupid even mean
went describe fact
imagine einstein brain could
preserved moment died
neurosynaptic element still
place sitting
jar ask question
question go ear get
transmitted sound trigger
neurosynaptic firing move
brain einstein
speaks
answer way setup
established like yeah
picture sometime distant
future maybe modern version
upload consciousness
youre asking brain
jar biological
point silicon im
asking information going
einstein brain thought
experiment
presumably trigger thought
need answer question
posed question could
comment exercise
exercise probing brain thats
sitting waiting ask
question um specific
interesting example kind
predicted processing capable
talking language
communication note
way set question
provides lovely segue large
language model um note also
kind embodied
intelligence talking
relation active inference
there brain
body brain embodied
brain actually charge
moving body secreting fact
two way
change universe either move
muscle secrete something
way affect
universe mean
deploy body way sample
right kind information make
um model apt adaptive
possible well chuck hear
said mean cannot bend
spoon brain right
yuri
g clarify okay
trying hint suspect going
come l conversation
there think difference
brain vat large language
model involement lot
knowledge one imagine say large
language model little bit like
einstein brain einstein plus
know 100 um possibly million
people history everything
written
pro asking question fact
people whose entire career
prompt engineer ai prompt
funny people program ai
leave job become
prompt people uh responsible
uh creating best prompt get
information back ai
pretty fascinating industry
theyve created
feedback loop benefit
start argue know
intelligence
prompt engineer scientist
would say thats intelligence
thats sort senting
behavior asking question
producing anw thats easy
bit know asking quering
world right way notice
job asking right
question carl ask please
um could active inference cause u
miss thing happen secondly
deja vu fit yes um
yes um oh um sense active
inference um really missing
thing uh measurable
observable right kind way um
another another sort key thing
natural intelligence um
good scientist um point
sort noting discovering
infrared thats act creation
art yeah come
somebody model structure
electromagnetic radiation know
think pick point
missed earlier creativity insight
um emerging property kind
question answering effort
improve model know
particular world coming back uh
missing stuff know always
fascinates way
move depends upon ignoring fact
moving im talking
phenomenon um cognitive
science called sensory attenuation
rather paradoxical
least counterintuitive phenomenon
order initiate movement
ignore switch suppress
sensory evidence
currently moving favorite example
uh moving eye
asked sort track finger
ive across screen moved
eye quickly
eye moving youre actually
seeing optic flow thats
produced engaging
something called ptic suppression
reflection brain
cleverly knowing particular
optic flow induced fake
news ability ignore fake news
absolutely essential good
navigation movement uh world
fake irrelevant
moment new york time
definitely fake fake
news much fake
relevant task
hand isnt different notion
subtle one simplicity
conversation uh im reading
fake irrelevant imprecise
like unusable brain
throwing basically like dont
dont nothing see get rid
moving neil neil
backyard rather mine
isnt matrix pretext
kind fit perception
might differ whats actually
perception
manipulated recreated well think
carls descendant put u
jar way he talking carl carl
laboratory look like full
jaw well yes well
several pod
waiting film matrix
course came
1999 25 year quarter century
ago hard believe
candid un sense
brain reality reality think
understand
receiving external input
brain
constructing detached whats
exterior youve enough
lived experience maybe future
theyre describing brain
implanted memory reminds
whats movie arnold schweger
mar um total recall total
recall thank thank get as
mar instead paying thousand
dollar go vacation would
implant memory vacation
yeah bypassing sensory
conduit brain course
movie story
science fiction h science
fictiony really well certainly
think philosophy uh
behind think probably total
recall uh particularly matrix um
think thats real
current um know going back
understanding people
psychiatric order perhaps real
people um odd view world world
view understand way
make sense world
different way make sense
world dependent history
predisposition prize
learned thus far also
information select attend
pursuing theme ignoring
99 sensation example um
chuck thinking groin
moment would guarantee youre
yet generating sensory
impulse nerve ending uh
point time
selecting capacity select
know think fundamental part
intelligence agency course
select mean
attending selecting 99
thing could select think
know notion selection
hallmark truly intelligent uh
behavior yeah analogizing
large language model sense
could give gibberish
could find crap anywhere world
thats online prompted
precisely going find
information necessary ignore
everything else yes know thats
really really good example um
yes part characteristic
bit ar ecture make large
language model work certainly
implemented using transformer
architecture something called
attention head exactly
mechanism basic mechanic
uh talking term
intentional selection make
transformer work select
recent past order predict next
word thats work selectively
pick something past ignore
everything else make work
talk probability
llm probability
mathematical equation happens
like every single letter thats coming
model literally
giving best probability
going come next okay whereas
perceive thing
world view llm show
picture ball red stripe
thats next house okay say
thats ball show picture
ball hand little girl
who bouncing going say
right might ball may
ball whereas show even
twoyearold child ball
take ball place
circumstance baby look
go th b difference
kind intelligence
talking yeah think thats
spot thats absolutely right
thats said yes okay
know kind
fluency um see large
language model compelling
easy give illusion
thing understanding
intelligence dont
right kind generative model
underneath generalize
recognize ball different context
way well would
set correctly setup
different looking
reading scene mean police
officer busting room
know who perpetrator who
shoot there
instantaneous awareness factor
draw exterior stimulus
know im reminded
carl saw one new yorker
style cartoon two dolphin
swimming one water know
park right theyre captivity
two dolphin swimming
one say person
walking along pool edge
human face make
noise clear theyre
actually
communicating
say ai large language
actually intelligent cannot
otherwise tell difference care
generates get
result seek youre going
say oh well intelligent
much human ego
speaking well im sure human ego
speaking um technical sense
um
think okay there loophole youre
saying im going say
bee intelligent
waggle dance tell bee
honey im going say
termite intelligent
build something thousand time bigger
make termite m
cooperate im fatigued
human trying say special
relative everything else world
brain stuff
cant let ask whats
common theme termite
policeman reading
scene common
three thing move whereas
large language model doesnt doesnt
um brings u back um
action active part active
inference question
um large language model um
attention large language model
given everything given
data requirement upon
select data going
useful learn therefore
dont build
expressive um fit purpose world
moral generative model whereas
daughter would twoyearold daughter
playing beach ball would
moving selectively reading
scene moving eye observing
body observing bow different
context build much deeper appropriate
world jared model would enable
recognize ball
context context ultimately
tell father im playing ball
great show brett kagan
mentioned free energy principal
work creating computer chip
neuron people call organoid
intelligence calling
synthetic biological intelligence
thats archive recent
archive actually recent archive yeah
think answer agi
biological solution mechanical
solution mixture
remind people agi artificial
general intelligence know thats
word stand
asking answer dont ask
either seriously ive told
even using acronym anymore
il defined people
different reading open ai
specific specific meaning uh
talk theoretician
would represent think um
people searching natural
intelligence natural gary know
ask question make
move towards btic neuromorphic natural
kind instantiation intelligent
behavior yes absolutely ch
coming back previous theme
notice talking behaving
system system act move
con sct data mining
smart way opposed ingesting
data um think people
mean talk super
intelligence g generalized ai
artificial general intelligence
mean natural intelligence kind mean
u brain brain want
know uh agi brain
know way truck
actually brain would
natural stupidity
brain without
stupidity thats really
back december 22 dropped
white paper titled designing ecosystem
intelligence first principle
road map next 10
year beyond terminate
ultimate destination somewhere
along line discussed
thinking behind move ai iia
iia standing intelligent ag
seems lot like moving towards
architecture sentient behavior
misread way youve
read perfectly white
paper written colleague
industry particularly uh versus ai
exactly kind road map um
people committed future
artificial intelligence
sustainable um explicitly
committed move natural
intelligence biomagnetic
move would want make
including implementation
neuromorphic hardware uh quantum
computation photonics
efficient um approach um would
sustainable sense know
climate change example also
speaking chuck notion
efficiency efficiency um also
like bait natural intelligence
sense
describe intelligent behavior
falling downhill pursuing free energy
gradient minimizing free energy getting
bottom seral packet youre
vi path least action
efficient way
informationally also
term amount electricity
use carbon footprint leave
behind point view
sustainability important get
right part
white paper saying another
direction travel away large
language model large title
seductive also
dangerous shouldnt large
size b
biologically able
much efficiently course
meme brain work 20
watt 20 kilowatt um
large language model um
low energy intelligence
efficient guess thats thats
way say ive seen quot
carl saying coming
age information moving
age intelligence thats
case age intelligence
going look like already
discussed well think
inception dist virtue
wonderful thing happening
around u thing
talking asking
big question know
whats going happening
happen next
next decade think part answer
lie previous um nod
switch ai iia iia
brings agency play one deep
question would current generative
ai example agentic agent
large language model agent
cant intelligent
certainly cant generalized
intelligence definitive
agent put
question half expecting joke
ive got agent smith head
anyone take run
yeah go right
hear people commenting
morality decision whether
decision good civilization
everybodys afraid ai achieving
conscious
declaring world would
better without human think
afraid know
true yeah going say
weve already come conclusion
thats
problem okay carl consciousness
selfawareness yeah im sure
lot people could answer
question get better answer
would say purpose
conversation probably think
conscious um certainly sentient
behave senent kind way
would necessarily imply
knew self im pretty sure
bee doesnt selfawareness
still sentience still
experien experience plan
um communicates behaves
know intelligent way could
also argue certain um human um
dont selfawareness fully
developed sort um know
severe uh psychiatric condition
think selfawareness gift
particular laborate deep
gentic model entertains
consequence action also
entertains fantasy hypothesis
agent self
selfreflective sort
metacognitive sense think um
think differentiate
selfaware simply um
capable censing behavior interesting
great let play skeptic
moment mild skeptic youve described
youve accounted human
decisionmaking behavior
model connects sensory
sensory conduit whats exterior
brain
information enters brain
youve applied free energy uh uh
gradient information follows
sound good sound fine im
going argue
benefit u think thing
way theact
pasti top whats already knew
going put fancier
word behind predictive
value model
predictivity reach
assume
actually make happen
ai marketplace yeah think thats
key thing mean im asked
question indeed ask
question sort apply
thing like hamilton principle
least sttion useful well
becomes useful youre actually
sort building thing becomes
useful youre simulating thing
becomes useful um something
comply pamps prp leased
action unpack
direction travel term
applying free energy principle
mean write
equation motion
simulate selforganization
natural um kind intelligence
natural kind senent behavior
simulate robot
artifact terminator want
although strictly speaking would
compliant free energy
principle um also simulated
silico make digital twin um
people choice decision making
sense making
simulate use
observation model real artifact
start phenotype say people
addiction say people
creative say people uh
schizophrenia cast
barren imprint false inference
believing thing uh present
theyre vice versa
inference problem know
principle sense making inference
model computer
go sampit
phenotype adjusting
model match somebody observed
behavior go apply
synthetic drug brain surgery
silico lot practical
application knowing thing work
well say thing work thing
behave presumes model
correct example decade
ago presumed think
longer brain functioned via
neural net neural network
decision tree slide
tree make ever refined
decision assumption
mirrored software
invoke neural net decision making
field astrophysics decide
galaxy interesting study
versus others million
data set put
neural net parameter
select feature might
end effort determine
interesting still invoke
think thats longer model
brain work doesnt matter
still helpful u youre right
honestly
organized around new way see
brain working yeah
brain model
emulated mean human
physiological system rife
baggage evolutionary baggage much
utility u today except
sitting available hijacked
advertiser
take advantage feature
30000 year ago mattered
survival today
dangling waiting
exploited
straight answer question
free energy principle really
know description recipe
selforganization thing possess
um set preferred characteristic
state coming right back
started bottom
serial packet thats live
want thats im
comfortable give
calculus um given
situation prescribe dynamic
behavior sense making
choice get
point prescription
uh best place
best um embodied form
saying exist
want exist sustainable
way could know specie
could meme given
environment yes given set
relationship
thats really key point
variational fre weve talking
prediction eror measure
way something couple
universe world
statement thing
isolation fit know
take notion
prediction error something thats
predicting there something
predicted relational
observational measure
adaptive fitness thats important
clarification yes carl could
give u sentence basian
inference thats new word many
people even claim know
statistic thats way using
already know true help
decide whats going happen next
subtlety
basian inference think
said um capture key point
updating way
describing inference people
mean estimating best
explanation probabilistically process
inference ongoing
sometimes called asing belief
updating updating one belief
face new data
update mathematically optimal way
simply take new evidence new
data combine using ba rule
pride belief established
saw new data give
belief afterwards sometimes called
posterior belief go otherwise would
come hypothesis assuming
dont know anything system
thats always fastest way
get answer yeah could
argue important cant
process path
belief space youre always
updating whether evolutionary
scale whether
conversation cant start
scratch youre using word belief
way state side might use
word whats supported evidence
believe something
true often word belief well
believe jesus jesus savior
muhammad belief ill believe
matter tell
thats belief right belief
protected constit tionally uh
ground move scientifically
data data come
support ascribe
confidence result measured
evidence support
evidentiary supported belief yeah yeah
guess say belief
strength belief
measured strength
evidence behind yeah thats
say gary
last question got land
plane yeah um
think u human uh
sadly u psychotic otes
schizophrenia uh someone
hallucination neurological
problem thats going inside
mind yet told ai
hallucination dont know
ai mental illness hey
learned lie thats know
ask question know
answer like right well
thats
school right dont know answer
might right right exactly
whats answer ah rocket
okay yeah uh speaking
gary marcus davos month ago
tell invented world
applied world word
hallucination context became word
year think
circle think regret
spirit using
um technically divorced
way people hallucinate um
think really important question
know theoretician
neuroscientist um think
term understanding false
imprint brain pick
neils point talk
belief talking
subpersonal nonpropositional basin
belief wouldnt
able articulate
way brain encodes problemistic
cause sensation
course get inference process
wrong youre going subject
inferring thing theyre
basically hallucination
delusion inferring thing
also
happens thas term neglect
syndrome dissociative syndrome
hysterical syndrome
devastating condition youve
got inference wrong understand
mechanic failed inference
think example hallucination
absolutely crucial usually track
back talking
term ability select versus
ignore different part data
youve lost ability ignore stuff
often preclude ability
make sense youre
always attending surface
structure sensation take example
severe autism um may get past
bombardment sensory input
modality part scene
part sensory alive
right alive guy think got
go call quits carl
highly illuminating yes good stuff
whats interesting much
youve accomplished thus far deep
know beginning
know next year much
less five year take
interesting check back
see youre making
basement
um brit neil garage oh
garage guy basement
garage go
wonderful thing yeah exactly
exactly okay professor carl thanks
joining u thank much
conversation choke particularly
soome ive ever done conversation thanks
joining u london thank uh
time shifted u stateside
delighted could
share expertise u
star talk special edition right
chuck always good man always
pleasure right gary pleasure neil
thank im neil degrass tyson
personal astrophysicist always
bidding keep looking
