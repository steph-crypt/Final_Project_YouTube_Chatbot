spent 10 year princeton long
ago day every year talk
people saying almost
producing energy put
would make energy
source world would say oh
5 year away 30
year ago whats going youre
almost oh
god star talk neil degrass tyson
personal astral physicist got
paul mrio paul whats
cohosting today good see
friend good see man
always fun love always
interesting stuff im trying yeah
got like broadway show
yeah would became broadway
taking around
country going ask
whens going get broadway well
going coming back
tired seeing street
broadway ran
nine people across late show
broadway loved yeah yeah
called permission speak directed
frank oz love frank oz yeah he
best involves people
telling story connecting people
shared story interacting
audience yes bringing stage
telling story
florida going
rhode island people go paul
mcucom see going
mrio r love love love
know got today day
arrive life want
arm reach fusion
expert fatina
abim pronounce correctly
fatim
almost ibraimi yes fatima ibraimi yes
got last one okay love
phd plasma physic
thats whole thing physic
yes plasma specific say plasas plasma
plasma youre research scientist
princeton plasma physic
laboratory pp pl correct
princeton new jersey yes route one
think yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
there fabulous home depot right
big
fan uh people heard
fusion theyve heard word
theyve heard word plasma
people think blood plasma
completely different plasma right blood
plasma like whats left
body body right mean
take red blood cell exactly
yeah yeah
right start get
vocabulary table plasma
plasma fourth state matter
99 observable universe plasma
really first state matter
exactly want think way
unstable right unstable
necessarily
dise wrote note
doesnt mean youre correct okay
continue vatima actually
floating plasma state
universe want see uh
actually plasma
know electron kind freely moving
charge particle negative charge
particle
ion positive charge particle
basically soup know charge
particle plasma right
always physic see
plasma join together word
fusion relevant
um sun
actually produce lot energy
fusion energy thats pl
plasma state
plasma order get plasma
hot yes nothing thing
cold plasma yes actually uh
case fusion 100
million degree actually achieve
fusion plasma know could
variety temperature could
low temperature plasma youre
going fusion exactly dont
plasma could also lightening
strike thats plasma
remember toy
thing could buy remember spencer
gift anyone older 70 remember
lava lamp yeah lava lamp one
ball sort
glowing thing put
hand ball would react
hand touching surface exactly
charged particle know
know plasma kind
resp make glow exactly uh
particle could also um de exide
kind produce photon light
thing okay electron
recombine exactly every time
recombine give light exactly
excite recombine know de
exite get get light
thats plasma thats
high temperature right exactly okay
candle also plasma
flame candle yeah
right need high temperature
fusion yes fusing
actually required fusion high
temperature required fuse really
light
atom uh
hydrogen um um also isotrope
hydrogen heavier hydrogen
detarium um little bit heavier
tritium two actually uh
neutron coll light
fuse really really
high temperature able kind
overcome know force
create lot energy neutron
force
mhm positively charged proton
another positively charged
proton like charger repel right
exactly dont want get together
right youre trying overcome
exactly high temperature cuz high
temperature mean higher speed yes
within soup youre able
achieve high temperature
still working toward temperature
high temperature actually
get high temperature
yet yes thats
proton ask long
journey
go bathroom
pulling
yes achieve really actually
experiment uh um facility
uh create know high
temperature plasma get fusion
really get high temperature
temperature actually achieve
fusion experiment even hotter
know center sun yeah
center sun like 10 million degree
something like yes 100
million degree generate
using theyre trying make
another star yes
kind stuff like
little girl
kind experiment basement
parent said got thats
nemesis superheroes done
im going make something hotter
center sun got
easy bake
oven well im going turn gave
power gave power
10 million degree know
im baking plasma youre going
like
want without
mozzarella cheese yes light
town
music
go thats fatima yeah dont
confess thats fine
get high temperature yes
understand order
make plasma high temperature
something else higher
temperature right
get high temperature plasma
know carry electr current
electricity current could say
exactly
therefore get
high speed high temperature
question get soup
going go
confine 100 million
degree putting
contain control control
uh put lot energy
magnet well wa magnetic field
physical thing cant melt
right right charged
particle respond magnetic
electromagnetism right another
force universe
electromagnetic force yes long
range one fundamental force
know electromagnetic force
everywhere know sun uh
star know uh wherever
plasma electromagnetic force
respond
gas need make state plasma
mean
know wave going gas
like antenna create plasma
could induce
inductively current particle
plasma go around chamber
talking tokom
maac amber donut shaped chamber tok
right cuz princeton tok maac yes
yes tok maac
word even mean russian oh
russian russian russi
two russian scientist called
configuration great act
70 atlantic city worked
worked stardust worked
flamingo okay know
named actual scientist
actual scientist
two scientist actually called
kind invention
say chamber yes chamber
basically sort harnessing
controlling plasma thats donut
shape donut shape exa heated
incredible temperature exactly
various way heating gas become
plasma heating plasma really
really high temperature heating
point
cusp able use nuclear fusion
get nuclear fusion propel
rocket space much quickly
rocket plasma propulsion
actually get rid plasma make
back rocket youre
confining magnetic field
plasma rocket dont use fusion
necessarily dont use
fusion kind know
space dont power
there gas station thing
son sitting
going give amount energy
rest stop
mcdonalds want go
far need energy need fusion
youre going go stay around
solar panel enough energy
use locally could use
propulsion remembered reading yes
know enough know know
gas temperature yes
particle moving
speed slow fast
temperature average speed
everybodys moving right
remembered there method
pick fastest moving
particle put
average temperature going
higher came
go treat
special put slower group theyre
f class yeah theyre special
class leave everybody else behind
youre cherry picking fastest moving
particle thing
remembering correctly
conventionally usually collective
know heating know basically
uh current know
like current plasma also carry
current current heat know
really uh actually basically
ic heating thats one way heating
plasma heat internally
hotter outside
make hot inside thats
thats one way thats conventional way
actually heating plasma
first way hey star talk fan
dont know know
audio version podcast actually
post week advance video
version get spotify
apple pod podast
podcast outlet
multiple way ingest
cosmic star talk spent 10 year
princeton long ago yeah like
im old man day didnt
laughter
electricity would yell
someone would hear
u day
princeton yes every year
talk people saying almost
mh producing energy put
mh would make energy
source world mh
inexpensive energy source using readily
available ingredient like hydrogen
find neighborhood
water molecule would say oh
five year away 30
year ago yes whats going youre
almost
oh
god wait wait let back
princeton token maac uh
lawrence livermore different yes
configuration two
approach one toac actually
fusion uh princeon special tokom
maac called spherical tokom maac
kind like like
fat donut corn apple
different standard nice
thing compact oh okay
thats difference
main thing really puffy donut puffy
could say puffy donut created
created fluffin nator
uh remember
thator think toac
spherical toac
special compactness um
thing uh using magnetic
field actually confine
plasma okay there let
go lawrence livermore livermore
california socalled inertial
confinement mean shooting
laser small dense
target get fusion plasma
pppl pum plasma physic lab
dense high
temperature there something
call little bit specific something
called lon criterion basically
multiplication confinement
time hot get density
combined larger
something say oh achieved
fusion inertial confinement
know kind generates
denser factor
density important thing
get sun get high density
free cu youre center
freaking sun dense
get free density youre
youre generating ppl dense
sort like would get
walmart versus sachs like
buying product would like
lower thats first time two
store ever
sentence
ever wait dense
hot hot dense
combination two get
fusion yes
point know optimum
relationship yes know
optimum want first
fusion achieved 19 um around
1995 correct fusion
achieved like
1947 uncontrolled
called
bomb time shes referring
control okay pick story
left safe
done got fusion got
everywhere thats got fusion correct
exactly h bomb know us
bomb trigger thats give
correct ex controlled uh fusion
done um uh princeton plasma
physic ra lab um device called
tfdr know test fusion uh reactor
obtained uh achieved
know obtained fusion
achieved um 90
uh princeon plasma physic rap
uh also another experiment jet
europe later uh
10 million jewel energy know um
10 10 megawatt million watt uh power
obtained uh weve got fusion
one jewel per second one
watt okay shes thinking jewel
energy watt power watt
correct one 10 megawatt
actually record 17 megawatt
later around much
question big fat
donut yes right whole thing
plasma hit fusion
threshold yeah whole thing
undergo fusion
lawrence livermore know
going happen going
happen little pocket
created yeah uh basically
vessel core vessel
kind um plasma core
actually need finally touch
wall thats actually get
en touching touching
magnetic field around actually
real wall magnetic field
around drywall like plaster
board call call
blanket actually form
blanket seriousness like
creates wall work
various solution wall
know could tong stone uh
come byct various material
byproduct youre way
youre manipulating plasma wall
creates actually
actually put physical physical
wall measured
touch wall uh uh
measured actually plasma heat
measured core yes yes
thats get really hot
plasma need wall
uh confined
plasma need meet boundary
thought magnetic field
right isnt magnetic field
magnetic field around
tauros around donut okay
magnetic fi giv shape yes exactly
give shape could say
could think could put
direct magnet around vessel
actually put coil go
around vessel wall
plasma magnetic
field weve played iron f
magnet see magnetic field
line form loop
toroidal loop okay know
surface sun
doesnt rotate solid object
magnetic field
get stretched sun rotates
equator faster region
point magnetic
field
snap break like
reconnect happen
space yes happens surface
sun exactly way said sun
actually correctly mentioned um
plasma state also create
know fusion energy lot energy
another thing sun creates
magnetic field motion
plasma creates magnetic field
im creating magnetic field need
get rid magnetic field somehow
visible field line im
creating go go
surface kind go like
loop mh loop kind
point invisible field line
one go one go snap
kind cancel right
there call detachment
whole loop kind get away
chaotic right mean sort
like bunch well
control like bunch
5yearolds kindergarten skittle
cant control theyre
skittle oh okay right yes
could place really
chaotic also could likely
collective know um rope magnetic
field come together know
kind cancel
magnetic field get
reconnection site whole
thing like detached plasma
magnetic field yeah know
physic astronomer
people study
called magneto hydramist oh god
thats word
one long business
card fold extra
section yeah business card
like know
uh let get back energy
want go rocket yes
youre going useful anybody
cant make energy
ground princeton new jersey got
got dont want call
portable got scalable
move town
generate energy radioactive
byproduct generate 247
youre using hydrogen yes whose
method better one
inertial confinement lawrence
livermore token maac design
princeton place
pursue method actually
say wow didnt know
congress said member
congress senator need pursue
okay america great like k
even dont know
method call call
innovative um alternate method
using magnetic field know
kind confine plasma know
get fusion energy need
need get
condition condition
get produce energy
put otherwise whats point
whats point exact kind
net gain kind need get
havent got engineering
wise physic wise scientifically maybe
range say oh got
energy fusion said
happened also 90 know
pppf yeah there little bit
overstatement livermore
experiment one net
extra energy experiment
championed
extra energy got relative
energy put
little spot didnt add
whole system made thing thing
begin right right wasnt
total energy budget
experiment energy budget
target yeah
target attached
target near target yeah
thats make measurement
think correct im
wrong youre going scale
presumably get good engineer
say make
little make
efficient
run energy need
also make better laser efficient
laser efficiency
great right cu put
energy laser make
laser going help
exactly engineering net gain
high
experiment physic gain good
also physic gain also
magnetic confinement good gain
actually moving toward
various know configuration
okay idea excited
particle fit
sort
calm excited
particle jazz music dont know candle
scented candle like
asking cool
plasma youre asking sense
whole plasma excited
particle right specific
thing control excited
particle oh yes yes think
want whole hot know uh
plasma confined
controlled selfheated
kind interestingly get
temperature kind
get know heated plasma
long long time produce lot
energy fusion uh system
reactor made lot
progress know part
usual yet hows
many many year
plug wall energy
side plug fusion
mean know going say five
year away told okay
listening go know didnt
hear didnt hear go mean
know like diesel engine
lot know advancement excuse
senator senator witness
answer question please
directly start mentioned diesel
engine table right
take decade yes fusion
new physic frontier
whole plasma physic
experiment know run kind
get new regime cuz youre
youre actual research youre
frontier right yeah youre
youre stepping one stepped
discover new thing youre
going discover youre going
discover hurdle could
predicted seriously right
word mean thats issue right
yes get new regime discover
new thing whole fact
actually whole uh rocket system
know discovery f
fusion system know let let
pivot right
still decade away shes going
make electricity right uh mean
uh miss easy bake oven
cranking stuff 10
cant
right commercially know vi
commercially viable mean know
fusion laboratory everyone know
important culturally
practical application fusion
right capacity bomb
bomb shorter time
scale um large
scale fusion uh system kind
give electricity whole city
could compact
design
taking know space
ever wanted one question

invite check link
money go
ability experiment new way
bringing universe earth
thank already
joined welcome others
participate grand adventure
bring universe
earth always keep looking right
forever yeah long weve
rocket weve using
call chemical fuel
mean molecule energy
contained within break
apart molecule energy escape
energy source
adv advanced hundred
year scientist lazy
youre really trying use
different chemical solid rocket
booster thats different propulsion
chemical big tank
essentially concept
concept tell plasma
rocket there lot written
even talking
fusion yet keeping
plasma universe yes plasma
propulsion basically uh
talking next generation
rocket specifically plasma rocket
theyre highly efficient yes yes
highly efficient term
several thing
um exhaust velocity really
high whats hard people see
earth surface dweller yeah
say want go forward
run step gas
youre expense
earth beneath foot
reason go forward
earth youre putting friction
foot earth youre
changing rotation earth
slightly youre pushing back
something push back
space nothing got nothing
push back way
change speed give something
giving mass take
yes take
case create
plasma plasmoid process
like solar flare magnetic
reconnection um detach
continuously detach plasma
back rocket high velocity
high temperature high
temperature get high speed yes high
speed um rocket
propelled forward uh
doesnt high temperature
interesting magnetic rec
connection magnetic energy
converted kinetic energy
magnetic yes like
solar doesnt like
want get point
point b yeah snap
finger youre like badass
badass google map yeah
different
particle come back
rocket recoil
much efficient
whats mass mass much
various like tiny
mass high speed high
mass thing side
go forward low speed right
going get anywhere youre
going get anywhere kind kind
high thrust high force
exhaust velocity
get um constantly youre
kind pushing know like
constant acceleration get somewhere
space different
right wouldnt use plasma
rocket launch
dont much cant send
much mass anytime
see rocket there coming
go way rocket fu
get get
sp like crazy
sort like w like massive
wifi spot thats like got incredible
power plasma thing
going well
think ive read
youre middle
correct im wrong youre
free space open space
turn plasma rocket know
like one particle time
slowly accelerate mh
acceleration constant case
increase velocity there
resistance coming rock
there resistance
recoil right since
constant long time
reach high speed
exactly based result
actually building
building tabletop prototype
plasma tabletop building im
using
oven lab youre building
get uh 100 500 kilometer per
second still
rocket move speed could
sunroof rocket
speed would would
sunroof see know youre
looking
well yeah thats
true need get
speed know uh go moon
uh dont need much speed
could plasmoid
rocket know small
payload three week something
plasma roet
scifi
actually real plasma
propulsion electric field
magnetic using
electromagnetic field using magnetic
week long time astronaut
apollo got three day
fast know
efficient efficient efficient
mean mean go back
forth
expensive uh fuel uh flexible
could use really hydrogen know
one want use fusion
use really light atom
efficient fuel flexible
efficient okay would use
would like nice nice car
yes would delivery vessel
supply exactly cuz
plan ahead send 3 week advance
get quickly
supply heavy right
youll get wait
using plasma technology get
get supply well think
point youre sending
low mass particle though
theyre traveling high speed mh
recoil small real measurable
accumulates bet
fly human one
rocket would make sense
going like pluto something
nearest star yeah
need use plasmoid propulsion
need nuclear energy fusion
kind battery kind give
force trust yet need
like like control
youre approaching planet atmosphere
control yes otherwise
driving rocket right
center well thats
big problem space travel
accelerate want land
somewhere pull right right
there there right right
like know
flip ship around
send particle
way negative acceler
deceleration eats
plan might use
going mar think yes uh yes
efficiency know could use
chemical rocket 10
year go use
resource really
need plasma
propulsion um getting mar
also need energy thats
compact fusion compact system
come thats work
okay plasma rocket
thing plasma fusion
rocket fusion
whole source energy yeah
plasma rocket energy come
uh solar panel
example moon
sun sitting get
know um use solar panel get power
cant level compared
plasma fusion getting
solar panel cannot give
level enough low want
enough want best im
american thats
america still dont
dont even
like fedex going moon coming back
yes thats talking
efficiently uh dont need
much power like 500
kilowatt enough enough dont
need mega million get
faster guy still leaf
package like 20 foot door
walk underwe
steal right nothing change
scientist dont really walk
underwear get package
okay port neighbor
requested
wait want like
settle understanding
plasma high moving
particle send back
recoil yeah acceleration
slow steady
accumulates yes okay
solar
panel solar panel
propulsion mechanism source
energy yes channel
energy back plasma yes
keep plasma going long
close enough sun exactly okay
youre really far sun
still need energy source
would energy source cant
use solar panel anymore sun
dim would fusion
source yes fusion um
nonchemical yes nonchemical
fusion source energy would still
heating
plasma basically yes fusion
appreciated still
plas rocket exactly exactly still
plasma rocket uh
magnet know first hand
use several still
power rocket source
power could solar panel
could could yeah
nonchemical fusion energy one
plenty hydrogen gas universe
scoop put
filling station un
told
going space
plasma sort sort morphing
changing account
mean survive
understanding survive plasma
various state right would
imagine able
document every state survive
right ever evolving science
basically need
fuel like hydrogen helium
fuel actually
use local resource space
fuel thats call isru yeah
insitu resource utilization yes ah
terrible acronym uh yeah isru
thats big thing yes
dont haul everything
exactly want
thats thats call
efficient basically fuel
flexibility kind yeah
doesnt helium could um
hydrogen kind doesnt
argan electric
propulsion gas dont even get
started argon thats ridiculous
waste time um argon
krypton uh could
kind gas superhero
krypton told lost im weak
around
feel there cant
exist need
source energy cant exist
plasma plasma kind
uh draw um draw
create ionize create
plasma yes thats specific
read paper pattern
actually see see plasma
created fuel local fuel
get plasma soon
create plasma get rid
back rocket process
magnetic reconnection youve got
lose mass right every
time go going go anywhere
thats saying earlier
magnetic reconnection plasmoids
come get created theyre
unstable become time
unstable decay magnetic reconnection
sort there
constant instability control
still working
able control four rocket
plasma propulsion
confining anything dont basically
dont care stability
fusion device find plasma
dont want go unstable
rocket make plasma use
magnetic field
pollute space get exactly exactly
exactly get rid
make new plasma get rid
rocket gradually go
direction 1800 got junk space
youre putting garbage
space attitude understand
plasma really junk
said
99 observable universe plasma
basically charge particle
space always
low density plasma everywhere
space see good said
observable universe cuz dont see
dark matter yeah dont know
hell plasma yeah
got yeah yeah yeah yes yeah
could say arent
altering plasma
coming back rocket yeah
arent altering space way
putting particle space
space 99 plasma begin would
put water putting
water pool yeah doesnt care
like putting hair gel
hair f state
matter yeah floating plasma
universe anyway kind make
little plasma get rid go
somewhere universe one mind yeah
universe one mind yes fatima got
land plane let let want
straight answer youre congress
professor abrahimi soon
plasma energy generating center
every city close actually
give u five five year
would say 5 10
year experiment
30 youre going right got
number term
drag back yes thats
scientific net gain said okay
want put uh electricity
im worried engineer
come need okay
thats first second
rocket human
use plasma propulsion first
trip mar use first trip
dont know possible
put resource put
could get
chemical right propulsion
sustainable kind um uh
travel uh need uh plasma
propulsion nasa group
working plasma propulsion
call get
next f yes give
funding go knew shed
begging money point
human travel fast
isnt issue plasma
propulsion mean slow acceleration
slow acceleration face
going like
know wish wanted get
line face seems like
acceleration really fun way totic
surgery
could say actually maybe look
um closer know place
go think moon could said
could plasma propulsion
dont going
mo weve moon moon
resource there sort got moon
rock top drawer everybody one
way one way actually
create fusion energy something
called neutronic mean kind
uh use theerum helium
know uh create energy
dont produce neutron thats
pp chain center sun
there loose neutron coming
yes exactly neutron bad
come theyll
nothing stop dont
charge theyre pushy theyre
advantage dont push
particle dont even know theyre
right yes neutron yeah yes exactly
dark matter neutron yeah yeah yeah
thats fun uh reaction sun
called pp chain proton
proton chain us duum trium
dont remember tridium uh
helium 3 exact exactly exactly helium 3
ter also fuel also
fusion thing um
want make step next
generation know nonchemical
propulsion first make good step
progress gradually going
use fusion energy go
yeah process guy
seem fairly lazy youre taking time
five year using
seriousness using ai
factor work
term advancement youre
going youre trying make
fantastic question
say fantastic
question didnt hear didnt hear
say fantastic yes actually
ai
right doesnt really exist
think real kept finger
go right go right
leg weird yeah
exactly didnt want say anything
like know think shes
around uh plasma
much plasma im sitting
plasmo dont tell yeah yes think
yes definitely know computer first
progress made
plasma physic fusion always
know together experiment
advanced computation work together
make discovery also kind
achievement together well
think kind need wrap
yes
unfortunately uh give word
future patient term
okay fine okay im sorry
asked answer like
well define future yeah yeah
yeah let say future
progress discovery doesnt
happen doesnt happen overnight
continuous uh work scientist
longterm investment
uh kind put energy
collaboration um
cross pollination various type
know group working various type
plasma type device fusion
experiment progress happened like
also new
physic learn every day every
regime plasma learn new thing
apply like know
rocket thruster apply
application learn fusion
also apply um
application uh
continuous work fatima typically
end yes session
offer viewer cosmic perspective
topic yes day
beautifully summarized plight
scientist engineer society funding
source thats would
said cosmic perspective thank
thanks making job
little easier
today good man always great
good luck need
sometimes right youre messing
plasma exact one day youll give u
tour basement exactly listen
whatever welcome
thank well keep vague
