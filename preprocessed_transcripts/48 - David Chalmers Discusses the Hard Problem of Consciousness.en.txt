consciousness subjective
experience think like inner
movie mind movie
got image sound like regular
movie got sensation
body got emotion got thinking
running inner
soundtrack mind youve coined
philosophical zombie
philosophical thought experiment
creature much like u
possible lack consciousness
entirely think therefore
brain ai system getting
close passing touring test 50
year ago already said passed
touring test move goal
line one radical view say
actually thing
consciousness illusion
generated brain im camp
maybe dancing around something
doesnt really exist mhm
star talk special edition neil
degrass tyson personal
astrophysicist got chuck kn
chuck baby hey whats happening
right right sir im
good thank gary oreilly yeah thank
love cohost
pleasure yeah yet
another episode consciousness yeah
done know
need know okay could
going mean
consciousness consciousness
reality understanding
interpretation reality filtered
consciousness totally
show cook today
right heading inner space
rather outer space inner space
love consciousness weve
discussed continually think
suppose precious entity um feel
like others planet
being yes say cat
going say oh dont dont dont
start cattitude please dont go
yeah think charge
cat opposite mean
hundred thousand year
greatest thinker grappled
theyve grappled
regard explaining
handful theory existence
apparently hard problem um
clue consciousness
make weve conquered
particular mountain dive
rabbit hole simulation theory
singularity virtual reality
going fun join u
professor philosophy neuroscience
nyu australian philosopher
cognitive scientist also author
reality plus conscious mind
two many book gave u phrase
hard problem consciousness
philosophical zombie along way uh
please david charmer david welcome back
star talk youre
street nyu new york university
right sea
train welcome simplicity welcome
need say consciousness
hard problem isnt
obvious need
decorated professor field
assert totally obvious
first said said okay
well giving thing
label uh everybody know
guess uh label would
would catch sometimes uh
helpful uh say obvious
actually know idea
consciousness po pose hard problem
talking newton
show actually find uh
newton one point say way
color mix optically produce
certain experience easy
uh say easy e
e say know way
understand stuff
objectively say brain
process visual input
give experience color
amazing pink shirt yeah go coral say yes
magenta yeah
experience pink come
newon said easy king salmon
form raised king salmon
kind king right wild c wild c
reduce food stuff
experience king salmon come
envision newton said
easy okay david instead
called easy problem
consciousness maybe would
figured well easy
problem problem thing
like people respond say
say consciousness put
table subjective experience
consciousness anything experience
directly first person point
view think like inner movie
mind movie got
image sound like regular movie
got sensation body
got smell got taste got
emotion got thinking running
inner soundtrack
mind allows consciousness
distinct unique others
world receive
could different someone
else receives world
sound like
problem sound like problem
bias coming term
receive accept
information come
experience subjectively
different way thing may
common maybe look uh image
shape maybe know experience
rectangle might
emotion brings maybe
totally different
suppose running input
measurement device
device come conclusion
matter put
information reach
conclusion yet somehow look
see something different
trust person device
dont know device like
specialized thermometer say
say 79° im going im going
device im going device im
sitting together get
im going device okay
like tell 79°
im going trust thermometer there
famous quote science achieves
maturity without system measurement
ooh measurement
system consciousness actually
render immature scientifically
relative field
petri dish method tool
hard
problem oh god
pro oh god walked
didnt know year ago
went along conference told told
everyone invented
measuring device consciousness
uh consciousness meter made
combination uh neuromorphic
engineering transpersonal psychology
quantum gravity pulled
uh consciousness meter looked
kind like haird
dryer back
90 yeah would called would
called second half
first sentence sounded like
word sell applaud sir
abouts bra ectoplasmic meter yeah
ectoplasm yeah whereabouts
brain think fermenting
consciousness well one
big debate going
neural correlate
consciousness bit
brain active way
directly connected
consciousness there actually even
among neuroscientist there
lively debate people think
say visual consciousness
people think sensory
area toward back bra visual
cortex back prefrontal cortex
front brain area associated
thinking judgment
question whats difference
prefrontal cortex frontal
cortex uh frontal cortex go uh
little bit little less front
prefrontal cex see less
front little less front
prefrontal
cex okay look brain
structure compared among animal
let say mammal keep
family
presumably bigger frontal
cortex mammal see
whats going thereby
decide certain capacity
thought animal
fair yeah people put
consciousness prefrontal cortex
probably going say consciousness
widespread animal
kingom whereas people think
sensory coures get
throughout animal kingdom maybe
much know like fish conscious
well know fish dont kind
develop prefrontal cortex yeah im
going say uh judging look
eye im im gna go limb
say
know shark around right
well thats true well question
tell creates
consciousness
emergent genetic code mean
emergent
evo bio sense
organism certain property
either mass animal
like flocking bird
feature really intended
emerged feature
necessary survival
consciousness emergent think
specifically evolved oo
sense emergent mean word
emergence get used many different
way sometimes like magic word
like dont really understand
dont know
like magic word give magic word
day sense consciousness
clearly emerges brain get
brain develops consciousness
come along brain develops
consciousness get complex
there kind connection
tell story
consciousness selected
evolution one good answer
right idea
yeah needed consciousness control
decision making
reflection far one
told good story need
consciousness thing
couldnt big complicated computer
without consciousness
really consciousness talking
level consciousness
think know definitely
animal consciousness mean
dog instance see
emotion see reaction
sensory data like see
responds
command pain everything
look baby didnt
know never saw baby
saw thing glob
human thing sitting
like making crazy face
control limb wouldnt
necessarily say well thats conscious
thing actually thinking
anything know
totally right level
consciousness baby
still arguing mean
long time ago people uh used
give anesthetic baby
getting circumcised
thought couldnt feel pain tell
im
joking remember day well sir
day think baby feel pain
think basic visual
experience actually wife work
stuff claudia pasos leading
expert consciousness infant
there still argument like
baby experience thinking
right deciding agent
general moral tell
last year baby
whole lot sophisticated
thought david isnt true
every single animal weve
studied depth past
recovering greater level
neuro complexity conduct
behavior previous generation
thought true every animal
yeah absolutely trend say
year thought
animal
cognitively complex question
whether theyre conscious used
think okay human primate
know monkey ape day like
pretty much every mammal probably bird
probably reptile arguing fish
octopus sound like clawing
way
ego singularity presence
animal kingdom
challenged research
conduct animal youve seen
youtube video magpie
bird got container
water thats filled top
drink water cant beak
cant reach water anymore walk
away come back pebble drop
pebble ra raise level
drink three four
time clear understanding
volume displacement clear
understanding archimedian
principle go back chuck point
level consciousness
sleep yeah unconscious
coma put u
general
anesthetic varying level
consciousness different time
idea behind anesthetic wipe
consciousness completely hard
test whether absolutely
one point 1970s example
people uh put kind rubber band
around arm anesthetic
didnt make far
said hear please move
hand know hand could
move like kind
anesthetic maybe working partly
paralyze day okay
work lot harder knock
action uh
pain awareness hard know
gone sure even
asleep dreaming there
certainly level consciousness
absolutely consciousness isnt
consciousness altered dream
different state consciousness
sure psychedelics alter
consciousness meditation alers
consciousness absolutely yeah im
glad science obtain
objective reality
world depend human
brain forget wed still
cave insult entire
field okay okay uh know
study whats different
brain different state
consciousness one
exciting advance last 30
year mean psychedelics used
oh god know
right
mystical actually see
whats happening brain
psychedelic david published
paper recently ai consciousness
yeah got invited give
uh give talk actually ai
people big annual conference
controversial issue whether
current ai system could conscious
called could large language model
conscious argued even lang
model like exactly yeah argued
probably theyre conscious right
give 10 year may well
yeah theyre conscious right
theyre letting u know
yeah good strategy waiting take
waiting take babe
dont consciousness
still
youve coined frame philosophical
zombie thats leing
think therefore
brain philosophical thought
experiment creature
much like u possible lack
conscious
entirely quite like zombie
hollywood movie know
behave quite unlike u know
maybe even somec conscious
experience eat victim
brain love taste brain
philosophical zombie one
way think say
computer simulation brain
right body maybe behaving
like would conscious
obvious many people think
creature would conscious
experience kind way
hypothetical thought
experiment raise
question arent zombie right
evolution produced u based
smart sophisticated thing
couldnt evolution
produced philosophical zombie act
like u well actually
produced zombie way youre
talking ai
speak ai via computer like
know dont know youre talking
actual computer speak
person would
know thing youre talking
doesnt well thats turing test
right precisely touring ai system
getting close passing
touring test way 50 year
ago already set past touring
test move goal line
goal line systematically
getting moved greater greater
complexity anyone decides ai
achieved consciousness would
blown away allan turing even
first round im old enough
maybe age eliza
remember eliza one first
computer program understood
language simulated psychotherapist yes
yeah basically uh youre therapist
type command
audio back type
uh say hi eliza uh im fine
tell well know
left home know five year ago tell
parent eliza would
come back question
get loosen talk
psychological state like like real
therapist like like real therapist
joseph weisen bam invented eliza
story go secretary talked
eliza lunch break
end said first person
who ever really understood wow oh
wow needed
friend youre record saying
language ai probably gain
consciousness within 10 year
shrinking timeline
impressive thing
mean
count consciousness today youre
waiting future
im tracking goal line
continually moved forward tell
close least passing
touring test theyve done actual
version churing test five
minute version people take
version gbg4 human
50 time getting close
passing churing test thats behavior
think still looking cple
couple thing uh internal
dynamic whether beat u
jeopardy go chess oh already
move goalpost tell
youre constantly moving
goalpost admit phd ai lab
30 year ago told u
would system carry
conversation like say conscious
sure thats im saying please
dont
hit he letting know im
conscious tell goalpost
new goal line yet reached
think people look internal
process current ai system
say go along
consciousness human human
think example feedback processing
super important consciousness
get kind reflection
earlier state right
language model feed forward yeah
introspection example memory even
home memory would require
basically feedback language model
essentially feed forward system
information get passed input
output doesnt circulate back much
doesnt need circulate
access knowledge
bast even need
cant fault needing
need need declare
conscious doesnt even need
people say least open
possibility since
way un like
way
one case know human one
case know conscious
maybe could
sufficiently different way
philosophical zombie right
benchmark consciousness
human system know okay
call philosophical zombie
rather higher consciousness
entity perception come
thats kind
started come computer dont perceive
actually observe like even
knowledge world
capable running brain
one u would experience
differently based perception
relationship world
relationship information
receiving declare think
dont want speak
typically speak consciousness
feature bug human existence
feature something praised
animal
example youre giving ai
susceptible perception correct
deny yet higher level
consciousness say yeah got
u beat youre saying thats
benefit position dont
want say oh youre still
conscious youre susceptible
error interpretation
back office
replica vano staring night yes
van go ai would
exact representation
scene front 1889 right okay
right scene
felt like right ill give
ai going unless
tell right thats point
train van go give
van go
exact representation van go
wouldnt made whole
cloth yeah infer consciousness
ai absolutely know
define consciousness thank
kind operational
criterion funny thing best
operational criterion consciousness
human least verbal report
right know whether someone
conscious ask know
theyre conscious ask
think im think yeah therefore
ai system current ai system
unfortunately become useless
criterion yeah sure
tell
going around saying conscious
tech company
made sure didnt say
language model
anyway function
theyre trained neil tell u
everything mathematics yeah
going find oursel tshirt
equation solve consciousness
mean lot people one
potential holy grail finding
law consciousness simple could
write front tshirt
maybe beautiful mathematical
weve einstein give u theory
relativity change way see
universe right thing within
penrose gone quantum mechanic
orc theory
roger penrose
theoretical astrophysicist
received community
published book consciousness
linking quantum well
helpful way got lot
smart people interested
consciousness anchor
law physic yeah yeah approach
bring quantum mechanic
furthermore nonstandard quantum
mechanic nonalgorithmic version
quantum mechanic went way beyond
know consensus even
physic combined
complicated biology like biology
microtubule wall neuron
controversial neuroscience
would say look creative
brilliant penrose
totally speculative totally
controversial ultimately well
received neuroscientist know
neuroscientist he
outsider actually
legitimate analysis said
know microtubule average
neuroscientist dont dont know
microt tual something inside
cell wall neuron micr
roger
pen dude even know quantum
computing brain basically oh okay
going wave function
collapse microtubule going
responsible plus think
fundamental feature quantum physic
probabilistic nature
reality underpins
would allow even possibly
perception free there
probabilistic firing neuron right
triggered quantum wave
function okay thats understood
hope didnt brain
kind prediction machine
really penrose biggest
thing thought human
mathematician thing
computer could ever used
girdle theorem formal system
ever complete consistent
argue point know
made philosophical argument
special
said therefore need new physic
go beyond anything computable
said let look theory
quantum gravity getting
know neils territory right uh
girdle girdle uh studied system
definition comprise math okay okay
okay turn applies much
math really think
also applies keeping belly
nice flat sorry thats different
girle know 1 1 2 2 2
4 rule get
okay ask mathematics
constructed completely
selfconsistent set rule okay
rule rule
consistent rule
concluded
pulled as
show point
mathematics
make something
declare true
ability prove true okay
assert
come rest everything else oh wow
shocking something
logic mathematics yeah
would prof true
prove keep
way reach point
somebody sitting
throne saying
let written let done
exactly happen point
rest know also
must know color
people okay colored people didnt
end oh oh im sorry
going say black
mathematician
oh say color
gentleman shirt okay weve decided
decided said color
king salon king salmon well color
color king salmon king
salmon say kind
like let say bluish say
kind violet well color
violet go like
flower thats violet violet okay thats
viol well color right
keep point
somebody declare cannot
reduce f cannot reduce
declare got say
agree red
take
penr color people think people
study cleanly got chuck
come upside
as know pen rose negro
color people theyre decid vision
scientist study color oh
go mathematician think
consistency completeness
sometimes end point
argue something special
human consciousness human
human insight seeing
mathematical theorem true
penrose thought way uh
machine could know people study
color say studying visual
process brain process
color could study
still wont tell experience
color king salmon like
something know
subjectively
oh feeling thats theyre
saying color affect
effect different cannot
know unless actually
experience subed im affected
blue green van go star
night okay feel color
feel color read
book anything
read looked image
brain processing would
give experience star night
going take different thinking
weve spent thousand year
thinking certain way
want
linear manner theory
right thinking
differently looking like
might challenge hard problem
know there consensus
one radical view kind
reductionist side equation
say actually thing
consciousness illusion
generated brain brain make
u think special
property nothing actually
im camp reason
im thinking maybe
dancing around something doesnt
really exist maybe like
want believe there special
thing make u seem special whats
driving sort
thousand brain theory hawkins
thousand
brain please youre dont know
thousand brain oh kind
like cognitive mechanism hawkins came
jeff hawkins apparently oh jeff
hawkins okay thousand brain
one singular brain
thats compartment
within brain may
disservice theory probably
talking
construction brain like
inside brain
multiple layer brain
somehow come together
give consciousness
model within model brain model
brain may misleading
model brain mean
dark space occupying
shine light thats
thing need look right
rolodex know
sure
exist
thinking well brain build
simple model world know
maybe model physic world
folk physic way simpar
different actual physic
say folk physic yeah like common sense
physic like know aristotle
physic thing impetus
may heavy thing fall faster
lighter thing theyre heavier
say wrong aristotle
kind stupid yeah
yeah hard he smart got hardly
physic corre one going get
right first time physic
someone make measurement get
result someone else make
measurement get different
result someone get different
machine try measure
phenomenon yet get different
result everybody think there
result none result agree
thats usually evidence phenomenon
people pulling thing
noise data there
agreement lead think
maybe consciousness doesnt really exist
way anyone think
everybodys idea consciousness
different comport
blend greater edifice
understanding consciousness
lead example physic
possibly think there
thing consciousness
dancing around pole
pole even let said
early day also think
core phenomenon people agree
coming
neuroscience phenomenon like
know blindsight people
identify object without consciousness
form contrast conscious
uh unconscious perception experiment
neural correlate consciousness
trouble agreement yet
wild fundamental theory um yeah
maybe thats happening another
50 year 100 year who say
there beginning science
thing agree
neuroscientist tend
conservative stuff mostly
theyre one writing book
say uh
solution problem let build
piece time well
eventually get fairness
youre new field compared
branch science
benefit six century birth
smart people includes galileo
died year newton born
newton newton einstein
benefit smart
platform upon build
century youre coming
yeah let let
conservative science let also
build speculation top
let realize right
speculation good thank okay
speculate quantum
mechanic consciousness
connected universe
consciousness wave
function totally speculation
speculation great
think im philosopher get paid
speculate like good youy
know really think idea yeah
dont need perform
experiment except thought
experiment pay parent
say want philosopher hows
going pay rent thought
experiment im philosopher
today
said think bullshitting
today there old joke
dean said know physic
like math department
need pen paper trash
canard could like
philosophy department need
pen
paper really good thats great joke
love love detach
consciousness consciousness
moment go back dayar 1650
whatever questioning reality
outside
throw future
ask reality reality virtual
reality real whatever real may h
people often use
latest technology day raise
question reality um know
deart put question term
dreaming know im
dreaming yes right
built thought experiment
evil demon know evil
demon isnt producing
perception world would
time even though none real
day ask exactly
question saying basically
know youre virtual reality
right might matrix
could computer simulation
suddenly question
kind contemporary way yeah
expressing old question reality
except mean let honest
put mathematical value every single
thing universe even particle
learned learned
call half half
spin spin spin charge charge
mass put mathematical
could put mathematical value
every single thing make
simulation every single thing sure
right virtual reality right
know actual virtual reality
system right
complex simulation model inside
bit value let
pull philosophy
represent reality computer
virt mathematically map
everything thats going
philosophically question even
matter oo point
cant tell theual reality reality
difference make
difference make reality
reality reality reality matter
thats im sympathetic
point
traditional philosopher response
go something like say
spouse cheating never
discover never know
difference
life
know sney go ahead never know
doesnt affect
lot people want say man would
suck would really bad even
though dont know
attitude towards virtual reality
even though seems
belief world totally
shattered way would
spouse cheating
uh dumpster diver podcast uh
actually interviewed nick bostrom one
right early advancer idea
might living sim he
one people right yeah he
philosopher wrote classic article 2003
basically giving mathematical argument
take idea
simulation seriously
four year movie matrix
came wonder inspired
allow philosopher admit
po culture influenced deep
wrote wrote article stuff
called matrix metaphysics trying
asked write article
matrix website back day nice
wrote something think one
greatest philosophical idea
published book later thats
reality plus
culture influencing everything
key idea matrix
doesnt mean everything believe
wrong rather living
bit
universe living universe
table chair
plant planet made bit
process computational system
simulation
made bit connects john
wheeler famous idea physic
basic difference
difference
clarification matrix
layered reality
consciousness contained
like within u
connected matrix youre
saying virtual reality
would bit would
mean theyre constructed
outside yeah well
pure bit bit
basic level there also
call bit
underneath bit got exactly
get green egg ham
virtual reality
go matrix find
computer running
simulation got bit
bit made like
voltage circuit board
bit probability
simulation
nothing super
sophisticated ant farm young
somewhere mischievous alien
parent basement programming u
school project school project
school project fair
distant gy likely high
powerered scientist set billion
simulation overnight left
running he going come back
morning gather statistic gosh
time dilation make
sense ruined ruin cuz
guess dont shut
would explain multiverse
everything oh god awful maybe maybe
hegel said end history
un becomes conscious
simulation idea
moment realize simulation
thats shut u right
dont shut u like tr
show oh god thats one favorite
episode rick morty saw
go microverse
microverse find teeny
verse one microverse
actually power car yes remember
inside battery
god he spaceship
yes yes yes spend much
life virtual reality right
people people spend know half
time least video game
thats one kind virtual reality
sleep walking continuous
virtual reality u think
coming
mark zuckerberg want right
metaverse renamed whole company
way metaverse
matter entertainment
metaverse like go work
metaverse
meet friend
metaverse like literally live
life entertainment
entertainment like yeah right
century experience virtual reality
isnt 100 complete know
long taste smell
sensory sensory
development v reaction think
probably getting coming decade
mean right vision
hearing actually pretty good 100
got apple vision pro
visual quality
high theyre developing
augmented reality glass like orion
one going walking
around big old headset like
future
surely hopefully end contact
lens contct lens brain computer
interface get get taste smell
touch working probably going
require direct brain computer
interace got stimulate part
brain body representation directly
smell area basically
simulation well end
going simulation
simulation yeah could uh may
already level 42
take u level 43 david
got take u
look forward well think
reality side going
getting immersive detailed
form reality question
going arise u
technological reality genuine
reality want say eventually yes
there also got exactly
question consciousness
first topic going ai
system artificial brain artificial
intelligence question
genuine real consciousness
meet
notion featured
multiple film upload
consciousness brain jar jar
going able upload
consciousness going better
upload synthetic
biological intelligence
silicon based intelligence
even matter even care
maybe doesnt mean right
best efficient artificial digital
technology kind
silicon kind uh bi biology dont
kind control
would predict well probably
least short term
uploaded well uploaded onto digital
process silicon
virtual reality also
reality running digital processor
silicon yeah ultimately
matter made
computation bit yeah
even matter mean told
someone 30 year ago people
walking around two knee hip
say well biological
metal right would care
still run thinking
cant replicate brain well
theyre starting find
take replic one
philosopher wrote wrote paper
year ago called meat
motion biology say
similar saying
unlike a50
50 dont need know
version phone
ringing right david thanks
coming back star talk need
often cuz youre neighbor
first yet another
edition star talk special edition
time professor david chalmer
latest book tell reality plus
question reality
consciousness reality plus reality
plus there whats there
paramont plus disney plus know
originally going call reality 20
everyones like thats 299s 20
reality plus okay well cliche
plus plus disney plus least
2020s cliche regular people
read yeah anybody okay
um introduction great
problem philosophy land
technology nice nice one one
read book solve problem
please go go
right chuck good pleasure
neil right neil
degrass tyson fourar talk always
bid keep looking
music
