california institute technology
caltech one branch one
10 center nasa scattered
across country one
pasadena california
music
charles elachi mission
control center he former director
jpl remember
current director jpl
lori oh
good good see go way back
way back remember
baby
think little place
love youve done place
uh really special
call center
universe yes uh everything happens right
right right right
also place europa clipper
data arrive yes
talk deep space mission
europa clipper
latest one put list
oh important though
understand going
least two gravity assist thats
thats thing mar fly come
back around swing earth see
jupiter past
weve done venus flybys well
venus one
trajectory weve worked
many year top people
working oned literally invented deep
space navigation right jpl
music
okay got
one exciting new spacecraft
europa clipper spacecraft
uh think 1th scale uh europa clip
got solar panel open
look like one one open
right others accordion
thats way uh launch
configuration thats uh thats
would like thats right
fully extended thats
100 ft wow basically
professional basketball court
especially need large
youre going far sun
exactly yeah tell
sending going
jupiter moon europa love europa
ice covered moon global liquid wateran
great place potentially life
living today main question
spacecraft
instrument working service
investigate whether europa
habitable really good evidence
galileo spacecraft europa
liquid water ocean dont
yet know ocean full
suite element needed
build life europa element
mean chemistry chemistry
right know carbon oxygen
nitrogen phosphorus sulfur life earth
take 54 element
periodic table want
inventory chemistry life
know totally yes okay
clear one really cool thing
design spacecraft also
um spacecraft design like
galileo spacecraft
cassini spacecraft always kind
tug pull
different instrument got
look spacecraft
going orbiting jupiter
fly europa 45 time
closest approach going
25 kilm europa surface think
thats insane get
like brilliant engineer
mean wait
fundamentally orbiting jupiter
europa thats right youre
clever orbital
dynamicists uh pinball wizard pinball
wizard love skim surface
thats get best data
thats exactly right coming
close approach
flybys side spacecraft
going looking europa
camera various
spectrometer collecting data
way
front end call sort
ram direction weve got mass
spectrometer collecting
stuff say coming europa
surface ejected ice
crack plume erupting
instrument
collecting data throughout flybys
going astonishing
like picture
alone going take six year
spacecraft get
picture alone jaw going drop
floor require gravity
assist going uh uh mar
gravity assist earth gravity assist
thankfully venus gravity assist
going close venus present
sort thermal challenge also
panel see little um uh
antenna sticking thats part
ice penetrating radar send
wave ice youre
double duty solar panel
clever right cuz going ask
close flybys
camera
sensor water still deep
ice hell
looking thats
magnetometer ice penetrating radar
gravity science
spacecraft right talk
galaxy etc youre talking
massive gravity well well even tiny
moon like europa size
armone creates little gravity well
clipper flying europa
going accelerate bit
decelerate bit little red shift blue
shift transmitting uh signal
back figure
moment inertia europa
get interior structure mass
distribution there thats whole
team whole team yeah
yeah instrument
investigation got team right
one thing dig
see mass distributed
another thing
distribution mass affect
trajectory thats like sneaky way
get without actually digging
thats exactly right yeah oh yeah
europa clipper
music
kevin
ocean world lab love
know ocean world
mean uh course earth
ocean know love need
protect work
earth ocean weve got
world like europa outer solar
system covered ice
beneath ice shell weve got
ocean lab weve got
fancy uh machine therm back
chamber recreate
surface condition europa
replicate ice extent
understand thats right
experiment based older data
experiment inform future mission
forth guess
tell look mad scientist e
want
say wait turn
uh pump
right yes go ahead
im touching thing blow
uh mean would
thought would need
much hardware simulate something
solar system thats right
reason need much hardware
pump everything europa
atmosphere mean got
whiff exosphere correct
um basically atmosphere
vacuum space get
check right pump
100 kelvin orus 2 180Â° f
cool super cold pump cool
right pump cool
europa surface bombarded hail
storm electron ion proton
doesnt literally mean hail okay
thats right hail mean tell
hail something else okay okay
flux
exactly yeah
fluence stuff coming
solar wind um little bit
solar wind jupiter magnetic
field entrains stuff coming
jupiter atmosphere think io
okay io inner large moon
io volcanically active body
solar system stuff spewing
io predominantly sulfur get
turned sulfur ion bombard
guard surface europa wait
youre telling volcanic eruption
io achieve escape velocity
catalyze chemistry europa
surface pollutes environment
jupiter thats right sulfur
aisle may actually help make
europa ocean habitable ooh volcanism
one moon feeding life another
moon thats deep deep uh
replicates surface europa uh
best place find europa earth
inside inside vessel yep
dont buy part catalog
kind yeah yeah
custom order various shape
lot company uh provide
catalog order part
like massively grown lego
kevin look like europa 101
right crosssection crosssection
look like youve got heat
source make vent let
ask geologist cuz youre
astronomer would think
europa would heat source inside uh
europa would little bit unique
compared earth
residual heat europa orbit
around um jupiter cause
stress source energy
melt would otherwise ice
way heck could ocean
exist far solar system
way outside goldilock zone
energy sun tidal
energy providing
mechanical deformation friction
heat may strong enough
power hydrothermal vent weve got
perhaps chemical gradient life
could harness seafloor
clipper going observing
surface europa orange
yellow spot think weve got
really good confidence salt
deposit case sulfur
deposit io
window ice europa
serf window ocean
would evidence
salty ocean provided crack
creep manifest exactly
still lot understand
geology crack
everything one key
challenge um separate
exogenous stuff microm
meteorite endogenous stuff
stuff coming ocean think
uh experiment there clear
sort dividing line right yeah
one hypothesis ice
shell work got thick sort
ductile component ice shell
overlin brittle thin ice shell
one key question im
particularly interested yeah weve
seen salt spectroscopically
surface know material coming
ocean mixed
salt coming plume
find might carbon compound
might organic might
whiff life get know
chemistry without actually
exactly cut hole
thats right go thats
music
right
music
beautiful stupid chamber
endearingly call ark
europa thats there indiana
jones reference right okay
chamber replicating
surface chemistry there another
question thats interesting
think surface europa
shape ice
large scale fractured
cracked tide small scale
there like there wind rain
anything europa kind
meter scale
sublimation okay water molecule
popping vacuum space
part
understand think ice
colloquially there one kind
ice chemically guy know ice
manifesting slightly different
structure right although would say
geologically geologically chemically
still h2o mineral
standpoint mineral assembles
crystal thats exactly right
ice 1h predominantly
bar simulates
sun raster back forth
simulating dial cycle daily
daily sunday night uh day night
day exactly world
youre thinking thats right
europa 355 earth day okay
light bar go across
time accurately reproduced
full spectrum sun photon
uh economy including uv
visible dont go far
uv cuz get little dangerous
okay term heating
looking sublimation driven
erosion thats uh
let show something uh else
let let go bottom
ocean europa ocean yet earth
ocean okay thatll take u
green monster
rock many rock came
various hydrothermal vent earth
deep submersible
going bottom yeah
rock chemistry
uh drive life de deepest darkest
depth ocean uh may well
also represent analogous system
world like europa look like
hunk salt kind
actually carbonate carbonate
okay lost city atlantic
like limestone uh limestone
kind metamorphosed know higher
temperature pressure kind
like freshly precipitated uh take
whiff thats origin
life might uh smell
like little sulfury nice bouquet
know something might crawl
one day ziplock knew
using bag many
music
layer part
ocean world lab focused
robotic system instrumentation
explore earth ocean cryosphere
eye bridge towards someday
flying thing like buoyant rover
ice exploration world like
europa got authentic engineer
thats right thats
scientist come crazy idea
engineer like wait got build
thats true
clipper
thats true uh amazing robot
uh call brewery short bre
buoyant rover exploration
earth life love chemical
gradient one chemical gradient thats
great interest geologically
biochemically etc ice water
interface could true
europa also might life
bottom ice sh right right
exactly would fly
would fly europa decade
decade come mh
meantime preparing take
alaska put ice alaska
study methane coming
permafrost basic idea
vehicle wheel want
hold careful spiky
sharp look dangerous look
like ninja wheel spiky get
grip surface chassis
float know jpl
really good making rover mar
rover etc ice rover
think surface ice
two wheel one
roves along underside
ice tail
instrumentation kind
call torque tail allow
drive forward backward
image floating give
position vertical depth
ocean
floating buoyancy itll put
pressure spike
thats exactly ice thats
music
welcome neil yes thank thank
youre eel man oh im
eel man eel team team one
one e people exa one
many e people yes yes yes
dream enable exploration
subsurface ocean inc
natural opening
ice oh yeah course there
cre andel youre going
go dig hole youre going use
hole thats already exactly thats
point vent
coming gu yes like
inviting u oh calling
calling u exactly right
nine au away yes okay
backyard backyard yes
backyard conceive snake
robot okay right called eel exobiology
extent life surveyor going
land incos explore surface find
best entury point vent go
way ocean
sub ice ocean exactly yes
find life
maybe would sign life
something swimming saying hi
going chemistry maybe find
microbe thats great timing invite
science read morgan k hi hello good
great meet good uhhuh
hoping include variety payload
could look chemical
signature life well potential
mor morphology bio signature
would like cell bit cell um
potentially metabolic indicator
well find food thing
microbe left behind would
type bio signature wed look
whats largest organism
would conceivably find earth
went billion year
microbe later get big
thats around billion
year well great question
typically look example earth
know try model give
guess might exist u
place like enceladus look
hydrothermal event seafloor
see microbe
find rich community include
know shellfish right crabby looking
thing yeah yeah uh
tube worm
live 200 year old know
didnt know amazing okay
capacity test life
going built eel
idea module
eel could include science payload
could include thing
robot need move sense
environment wow yet
extra billion buck yes
built robot right build
robot brought place
closest
glacier right asasa glacier
canada went exactly year ago
test ice teste
crass two arm right p
arm like push wall
support weight
like k use screw go
oh neutrally buoyant
otherwise would fall
get stuck water control like
support
weight jet coming right
right happy
made look
everybody okay right want see
itday night oh real
version one ive seen picture
right behind okay thats little
creepy im going nightmare
thing turning chasing
street bite doesnt bite
controlling uh mike pon uh
basically asked robot come
robot woken
idea world look like
getting live data sensor
making decision watch
travers say ai say
ai exactly fine right
maz rover anything go wrong
break ask home help
enceladus youre going
vent uh plume force
constantly pushing need
push wall sufficient
amount grip grip
dont get blown
robot solving problem
real time go sideways
well actually invite drive
robot thats little scary
look like assessing
long realistically would
length eventual
enceladus mission would roughly
size modular like one
module repeated 11 time
scalable yes according mission
destination
take decade reach dont want
wait century get right
science right whole point eel
versatility directly
explore unknown environment
one shot first mission uh big
challenge deal lot
uncertainty going
unknown youre limited
bandwidth term communication
there lot need ai
land robot cannot live
stream video data need
lot reasoning make
decision rob going
show weve integrated vm vision
language model bring
reasoning capability robot hey
eel go ahead introduce
hello im eel extant
exobiology life surveyor im snake
like robot designed explore planet
ring especially enceladus
mission navigate navate tough
terrain collect ice water sample
look sign life move using
screw driven module various
sensor help navigate right
im nasa jet propulsion laboratory
preparing mission operator
team jpl control remotely
task question let
know go ahead scan room
getting action part
there online agent thats
running getting command chat gpt
like talking command center
scanning room full 3d
space youre going see po
screen see using wi
r constructing map
everything could see call
cobra
pose love going tap
onboard sensor like camera
going eel describe
see room right eel go
ahead describe see
room room several people working
around table equipment
computer monitor office equipment
key point people 3 away desk
4 away monitor 35 away cable
2 away blackbox 1 away
let know need detail
ask see anything
alive oh could yeah good
see anything thats alive yes
several people room gathered
around table
